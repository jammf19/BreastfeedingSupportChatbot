"Breastfeeding for autistic women & parentsThe PositivesCommunication differencesSupport for breastfeeding women & parentsSensory differencesKey things to be mindful of when supporting an autistic person to breastfeedBreastfeeding an autistic childSensory differences in childrenHigh needs baby & feeding patternsFeeding patterns, boundaries and weaningAutism is a neurodevelopmental difference which may cause differences in how an autistic person will experience the world and communicate. An autistic person may be described as neurodivergent.Autism presents differently across the spectrum and many autistic people’s abilities and challenges will change depending on the situation they are in. Many autistic women will choose to have children and breastfeed, and some breastfed children are autistic.Many autistic women and parents will choose to breastfeed. There may be additional challenges and strengths for both the autistic parent, and for the parent breastfeeding an autistic child.Breastfeeding for autistic women & parentsAn estimated 0.82% of the population of England are diagnosed autistic, but up to 72% of the autistic population of England are estimated to be undiagnosed[1], and this is something to consider when supporting parents. Autistic women and people may have different needs when accessing maternity care and breastfeeding support, and these needs may be different for each autistic person[2].Autistic women may all present differently, with a wide range of different experiences across the spectrum. Individualised support can be very helpful for autistic people, and some autistic people may struggle to access support in standard ways[3]. Autistic women may mask, which means they may suppress their behaviors in lots of situations, even when they need support.The PositivesMany autistic women say they find the act of breastfeeding provides calm, quiet time that they enjoy. Breastfeeding offers protected time to sit and rest, and many find breastfeeding empowering.Autistic women often excel at researching and finding out information independently. This means those who plan to breastfeed may already know a lot about breastfeeding and, if they decide to breastfeed, are likely to be very determined[4].Communication differencesSome autistic people have communication differences. This may be situational, for example, an autistic person may be unable to verbally communicate in certain situations, but able to speak the rest of the time. It can be useful to have a range of communication methods, including the option to write or type on a phone, use picture cards or sign language.Support for breastfeeding women & parentsSome people feel more comfortable attending local breastfeeding groups where there are pictures available to show exactly where to go and what happens at the groups, or when they can attend the group with a support person. Many autistic women find it difficult – or do not feel comfortable – asking for additional support.Some autistic women already feel that they haven’t had control over their own bodies and experiences after giving birth. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rates are higher in the autistic community compared with neurotypical people[5].Many autistic mothers experience a lack of social support and may find it challenging to seek support from maternity services[6]. This can be due to anxiety about attending groups or differences in communication. This may include struggling with phone calls, which prevents access to national helplines or reaching out to local breastfeeding support.LLLGB offers the option to seek breastfeeding support via a writtenHelp Form.Sensory differencesMany autistic people experience senses differently. Sensory differences can cause a heightened or reduced experience of smell, taste, touch, sight and sound. This may affect breastfeeding in a number of ways:The milk ejection reflex (MER), commonly called the ‘let down’, is a neurohormonal reflex that releases milk from the breast. This can be experienced as a tingly feeling, or in someone with sensory differences it may feel uncomfortable, or even be experienced as pain. Some do not feel the let down at all. Very rarely, some people experienceDysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-MER).Some people experience an aversion to nursing. This is often temporary and dependent on the situation. Some people with sensory differences may have an aversion to feeding in a noisy area, or a very bright or busy area. Some people experience this more strongly when dehydrated, very tired or having their period.Noise can be particularly difficult for some autistic people. Increased noise can cause so much sensory input that other input – such as touch or experiencing a let down – cannot be tolerated. Many mothers find that it can be helpful to use ear plugs or avoid loud areas. Often, this doesn’t apply to noise created by the person themselves, or their baby. Maternity care providers should be reminded of this when on postnatal wards.Key things to be mindful of when supporting an autistic person to breastfeed:Many autistic people prefer information that is “straight to the point”.Autistic women often want to be given all options to make an informed decision and have a practical plan going forward.Many expressed a dislike for support that involved physical touch.Breastfeeding an autistic childWhile adults can often go undiagnosed, autism diagnosis rates in children are increasing[7].The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding for two years and beyond, and the natural age of weaning is estimated at 2.5–7 years[8]. Breastfeeding may be very important to a child who is autistic, or suspected to be neurodivergent. There may also be additional support needs and considerations.Sensory differences in childrenAutistic or neurodivergent children may process things or experience sensory input differently. Some autistic children may be more sensitive to certain sensory experiences, and this may include avoiding or seeking sensory experiences.Sometimes, a child with sensory differences may want to breastfeed very frequently in order to regulate themselves. Sometimes sensory differences may mean a child wants to breastfeed less often.They may want to feed and be close to their mother or parent when feeling overwhelmed, for example when in a busy, loud, or unfamiliar place. Or they may find it difficult to feed when struggling with sensory input– this can be anything from the temperature of the room to their socks! If this happens, it can be helpful to change the situation in order to reduce or avoid the sensory input they are struggling with.High needs baby & feeding patternsMany babies and children may be described as being ‘high needs’. This typically refers to babies and young children who have an intense need to be close to their mother or primary caregiver which is normal and expected, but this can be particularly intense with neurodivergent children.Parents should be mindful of self-care.Support from family and friends, and finding like-minded communities is essential, particularly during the intense early years.Feeding patterns, boundaries and weaningMany breastfeeding parents of autistic children find frequent feeding in toddlerhood difficult, and have highlighted the need for increased information about weaning.Weaning can be more challenging with autistic children because of sensory and communication issues, or because breastfeeding is an important way for the child to co-regulate.An LLL Leader can offer support and information about boundaries andweaning from the breastat different ages and stages.If a child is experiencing sensory differences, they may struggle to eat solid foods and want to breastfeed frequently rather than eat. Sometimes, a child may only start rejecting certain foods due to texture, taste, smell or sight as they get older, and this may result in an increase in breastfeeding.Some autistic people have interoception difficulties. This means they may struggle to feel when they are hungry, thirsty or full.Many motherscontinue to breastfeeduntil their child outgrows the need (‘self-weaning’), and some will continue to breastfeed older children responsively (‘on demand’). Others may choose to set gentle boundaries, and limit the number or length of feeds, or when and where breastfeeding takes place. Some parents may choose to stop breastfeeding altogether.Continuing to breastfeed into toddlerhood and beyond provides a range of benefits for both the child and mother, and provides nutrients that a child may be missing from their diet if it is limited.A mother who is breastfeeding an autistic toddler or child may request support to place boundaries or limit breastfeeding, if they choose to. This can be challenging when communication issues are involved, but options are:Distraction from breastfeedingDelaying feedsLimiting feeds to a certain time of day, or limiting the length of feedsOffering food or drink instead of breastfeedingFinding another activity which helps with sensory regulationWritten by Emily Lunny, November 2023.

"Making the transition from using bottles, cups etc., to feeding at the breastThere are lots of reasons babies might need more milk than they can get directly at the breast:They don’t have enough energy to do all the work of feeding.They may have been born early or small-for-dates, or are unwell, orjaundiced, or have lost a lot of weight. They may be keen to feed, and have good feeding skills, but theyfall asleepbefore they’ve taken as much milk as they need. They need time, patience, and plenty of milk, before they can do all the work of feeding for themselves.and/orThere isn’t enough milk available at the breast to meet all their needs.This might happen if:Milk is slow to increasein the early days after birth, for example because the birth was very difficult, or if you have diabetes.Not enough milk is removed from the breastsin the early days after birth. This can happen because the baby wasn’t breastfeeding often enough (perhaps because they were very sleepy, or formula was being given instead of breastfeeding), or feeding was inefficient (perhaps they weren’t deeply attached at the breast, or had atongue tie). Most of us need to remove milk from our breasts at least 8 – 12 times in 24 hours, in the early weeks, to bring in a full milk supply.You have a limitation on how much milk you can make. This could be because of previous breast surgery, hormonal issues, or other factors related to your breasts or your health.Here is more information onhow milk production works.Babies need enough milk to grow well, and to give them enough energy to feed.Some babies need extra milk – known as “supplements” or “top ups”, as well as, or instead of, direct breastfeeding. Here is more information aboutincreasing your milk production, andhow to give supplements.Many babies who have needed supplements can go on to breastfeed exclusively(get all the milk they need, directly at the breast).1,2But not all can. For many reasons, we are seeing more families with complications that make exclusive breastfeeding out of reach. No one can guarantee, right now, how this is going to turn out for you. But whether or not you need to keep using supplements, we can help you find a way of feeding that works for you and your baby.Laying the foundations – Helping your baby to grow wellYour baby needs to be growing well, before you start reducing supplements. Babies who are well fed, feed better. The bigger and stronger they get, the more they can “grow into” breastfeeding. Work closely with your healthcare providers and a breastfeeding supporter (for exampleLLL Leader), to figure out the amount of supplement your baby needs.It might be suggested that you feed your baby a certain volume of supplement each feed or each day, perhaps based on their weight. A simpler approach, if you’re not sure what to do, is tolet your baby show you the amount they need. Offer more, if they seem to want it. They might take very different amounts at different feeds.It’s important touse feeding tools carefully, to avoid over-feeding. Just because a baby drinks milk from a bottle doesn’t necessarily mean they needed it – babies will suck on anything you put in their mouth. “Paced feeding” enables your baby to take breaks, and stop when they’ve had enough. Here is more information onhow to use bottles and other feeding tools.If your baby is very sleepy, or premature, their appetite might not be working well yet, and they may need active encouragement to take as much as they need.Your baby’s growth is the most reliable guide to whether they’re getting enough milk. This article has information onhow to work out if your baby is getting enough milk.Define your feeding goalIf your baby needs supplements at the moment, what you do next depends on what your feeding goal is.You might already be happy with the mix of feeding you’ve got. Expressed milk and/or formula can be used alongside, or instead, of direct breastfeeding, for as long as you want. You can read more inUsing Donor Milk and Formula to Support Breastfeeding.Some parents feed their babies entirely on expressed milk– a huge labour of love. You can find out more inExclusively Expressing Breastmilk For Your Baby.If you would prefer to be doing more breastfeeding, and less (or no) supplementing, read on…You also need support from a breastfeeding helper, and your midwifery or health visiting team.You need a plan that is safe for your baby, and tailored to your individual situation.It is really important to keep a close eye on your baby’s growth while you are working on reducing supplements. Babies are routinely weighed at certain times: around five days, ten days, six to eight weeks, and then once a month, if you want to. This is fine when feeding is going smoothly, and babies are thriving.This is not often enough while you’re working on transitioning from supplements to direct breastfeeding. Weekly weighing is more appropriate, gradually moving to fortnightly and then monthly, when it’s going well.Gradual weaning is safest – both from the supplements and the scales!You can find more information below on signs that your baby is ready to manage with less supplement.But your baby’s growth is the most reliable indicator of how things are going. You might find it useful to share this article with your healthcare team.Plan to reduce supplementsStep One: Maximise Your Milk Production[If your baby is already fed only on your milk, you can skip this step].If your baby needs donor milk or formula at the moment, and your goal is to feed them more of your own milk, then the most urgent task is to work on your milk production. This is much more time-critical than your baby learning to breastfeed, or to breastfeed better.Babies come hardwired to breastfeed, and can learn for many weeks(at least 2-3 months, maybe longer) after term birth. There are even case reports of adopted children aged over a year starting to breastfeed!3You can read about what’s most urgent, and what can wait, inGetting Breastfeeding On Track After a Difficult Start (the “Three Keeps”).The time-window for increasing milk production is shorter.Milk production normally reaches its peak by a month after birth, with most of the increase happening in the first two weeks. From 1-6 months, it stays about the same.4After the first month, your body is not expecting to increase the amount of milk you’re making, so it tends to get harder to increase it. Though you never know what you can do until you try, after the early weeks there are no guarantees of being able to get a lot more milk.If you want to make more milk, the earlier you act, the better your chances. To find out how, seeHow to Increase Your Milk Supply. Frequent, effective milk removal is key. If you want your breasts to make more milk, you need to keep reminding them that you need more (it’s a bit like nagging!).“Just breastfeed more often”?You might assume – or even be advised – that all you need to do to make more milk is to breastfeed your baby more often. This may be true,when a baby is good at breastfeeding, and breastfeeding is going smoothly.But it’s not true, and might be really unsafe, if breastfeeding is difficult for your baby, and it’s not yet going well.It’s a bit like asking your baby to do two jobs: feed themselfanddo the work of increasing your milk production – even though they don’t yet have a track record of doing even one of these jobs successfully! For now, you will need to do some (or even all) of the work for them.First Things FirstIt makes sense toconcentrate on your milk production first – before reducing supplements. It can feel overwhelming to try and do everything at once – prioritise what is most urgent. When you have more milk:Your baby won’t have to work so hard to remove milk from the breast.Breastfeeding will be more rewarding – so it will be easier to transition your baby to doing more breastfeeding.Signs that your milk production is increasingIf you’re expressing your milk, the amount you’re able to express each day will have increased. (It’s normal to have times when you can express more, or less – the daily total is what counts).You might notice that your breasts start to feel fuller more quickly between feeds or expressing sessions (although this is not always the case).If your baby is doing some direct breastfeeding, they might swallow more often, feed for longer and seem more satisfied after feeds.If your baby is doing quite a bit of breastfeeding, they might grow faster.How much milk do you need?It might be useful to know that between about one and six months, an average baby takes about 800ml in 24 hours. But some babies thrive on as little as 600ml, while some take as much as 1300ml.5The practical answer is:Enough to satisfy your baby andEnough for your baby to grow well.The first step is to replace some or all of the donor milk or formula supplements with supplements of your own milk.If your baby is premature or unwell,they might only be taking small amounts of milk at the moment. If your goal is to feed them only on your milk as they grow, you will need to aim to get the kind of amounts they’ll need later, not just the amounts they need now. The figures above can be a guide.The earlier you start expressing, and the more often you express, the more milk you’re likely to make. If you end up making more than your baby needs at the moment, you could freeze it for later use, or donate it to a Milk Bank, to benefit other premature babies.When you’re not able to produce all the milk your baby needs, it can feel really disappointing to realise that they will keep needing donor milk or formula as well.If, despite your best efforts, the amount of milk you’re making has stopped increasing, or hasn’t increased at all, you have probably reached the limit of the amount you can make. A breastfeeding supporter can help you work out if you’ve reached this point.Some of us wonder whether, if we can’t make all the milk our baby needs, there is any point in carrying on at all. While only you can make the calculation about whether the effort you’re putting in is worth it, any amount of human milk protects babies in ways no other milk can.6,7You can find more information about thepower of your own milk(however much you’ve got!), andusing other milk to support your baby’s growth.Now you are in a new phase: maintaining the amount of milk you’ve got. You can experiment to see how many times you still need to feed or express, to keep up this amount. (This piece explains how to do it:The ‘Magic Number’ and Long-Term Milk Production). As long as you keep removing this amount, you will keep making this amount.It’s a long game.After babies start eating family foods, around six months, their need for milk gradually reduces. It’s often possible to reduce, and maybe stop using, supplements of donor or formula milk, while keeping on breastfeeding or expressing for as long as you want. Many of us who’ve had to deal with low milk production in the early months find that we can really relax and enjoy breastfeeding at this stage.Step Two – Transitioning to the BreastWhen you’ve got as much milk as you need, or can get, you’re ready to think about reducing supplements.Work with a breastfeeding helper to make a tailored plan for you and your baby.Yourlocal La Leche League Leaders(breastfeeding counsellors) may be able to support you themselves, or help you find someone else who can. Many areas have an NHS Infant Feeding Team to help families with complex feeding issues – ask your midwife or health visitor where you can get specialist help.If your baby isn’t breastfeeding yet, seeMy Baby Won’t Breastfeedfor lots of tips on how to help your baby make a positive relationship with the breast.Celebrate the baby steps: drinking from a cup or bottle while in skin-to-skin contact; falling asleep afterwards with cheek pillowed on breast; having a short try at the breast after taking some supplement. If your baby is able to stay at the breast for even a short time, it’s valuable practice. Learning to breastfeed, when something is making it difficult, is like exercising: you wouldn’t expect to run a marathon without doing lots of much shorter training runs first. Your baby gets much more from breastfeeding than just milk – don’t forget to savour the other stuff!Make sure you’re using your feeding tools well.They’re there to support breastfeeding, not compete with it. Babies are very smart – if breastfeeding is difficult for them, and another method is much easier, they might prefer to stick with the other method. SeeBottles and Other Toolsfor how to use bottles well, and lots of alternatives if you prefer not to use them.Consider some extra (or different) feeding tools.It might be as simple asreplacing some or all bottle-feeds with a cup or supplementer(see below). Limiting or reducing use of artificial teats (includingdummies) can encourage reluctant babies to spend more time at the breast.A“nursing supplementer”(sometimes also called a lactation aid) enables you to feed your baby expressed milk or formula at the breast while they breastfeed, via a thin tube placed by your nipple. This can be a great tool to help transition a reluctant baby to the breast, or for longer-term use if milk supply is low. Find out more:Nursing Supplementers. (Read two mother’s stories, here:Breastfeeding With a Nursing Supplementerand here:In Praise of At-Breast Supplementers.)Another tool is anipple shield– a thin layer of silicone, placed over your own nipple. Fitted and applied well, they can help a bottle-feeding baby transition to the breast, or a baby with a weak suck (for example because they’re premature) take more milk.8If you’re interested in trying these tools, it’s helpful to work with a breastfeeding supporter who knows how to use them.When you’ve got all the pieces in place…Your milk supply is as high as you need, or can getYour baby is growing wellYou’ve chosen feeding tools carefully, and are using them wellYour baby is willing to feed at the breast, at least sometimes…What next?While the process will look different for every baby, these principles can help you and your breastfeeding supporters along the way.Never go “cold turkey”!Sometimes, parents are advised to stop using supplements suddenly, to “force” their baby to breastfeed. Unless your baby is almost exclusively breastfeeding already, and growing well, this is extremely unsafe.Babies never choose not to breastfeed well – if they don’t, it’s because they can’t, not because they won’t!Your baby needs their usual amount of milk throughout this process.Watch your baby for signs of readiness.Babies who lacked energy to feed show us when they are ready to take on more work. If your baby was premature and sleepy, or has had a tongue tie division, for example, there will come a time when you start to notice that their feeding is changing. It feels like they’re sucking more strongly, and maybe keeping it up for a bit longer. They might start wanting less supplement.Nowthey’re ready tobegindoing more of the work of feeding.Take it steady. We know it’s really tempting to rush this – you want to breastfeed! – but it pays to make the transition carefully. Your baby doesn’t have a track record of breastfeeding yet, and it might take a while before they’re good at it. If they’re small, low in energy or unwell, they’re unlikely to be able to do all the work of feeding today, when yesterday they were doing little or none.If your baby was born prematurely, expect it to take at least until their original due date, plus a bit longer, before they’re able to do all the work. They’ve had more to cope with out here in the world, than if they’d been born later. The more health complications they’ve had, the more time they’re likely to need. We know it’s really frustrating not to know exactly how long this will take. Connecting with other families who have already made this transition may be the most helpful thing you can do at this stage. Yourlocal LLL groupwould love to support you.Do a small trial, keeping a close eye on your baby’s nappies, and weight. If you feel your baby might be ready for a step forward – try it! Breastfeed a bit more, and offer alittleless supplement. If you’ve been giving, say, 300ml per day, see what happens if you reduce it to 270ml. You could spread this reduction out over more than one feed. If your baby is able to take more milk from the breast, they’ll continue to produce wet and dirty nappies as normal, and to grow well. If their nappy output reduces, or their weight gain slows, you will need to go back a step, and try again later.It’s really important to weigh your baby regularly during this stage.Two weeks, or a month, is a really long time for a baby – and for your milk supply – if things turn out not to be going well.In between weight checks, notice how your baby is responding to any reduction in supplement.If your baby seems unsatisfied after the reduced supplement, this may be a sign that it’s been reduced by too much, too fast. You could try offering the breast after a supplement, and see how they respond. They might be satisfied with the comfort that being at the breast provides, rather than more milk – or they might need more supplement.If you’re expressing, cut back gradually.If you’ve already been working hard to build your milk supply by expressing, you know exactly how precious it is! Reduce the number of times you express one at a time. Only take the next step if your baby continues to grow well. For example: if you’ve been expressing six times in 24 hours, start by reducing to five, spending more time breastfeeding.After a few days (ideally no more than a week), weigh your baby again. If your baby has grown well that week, reduce your pumping sessions to four, and repeat. It might feel frustratingly slow, but you don’t want to risk damaging the milk supply you’ve worked so hard for. If you notice your breasts becoming uncomfortably full, it may be a sign that your baby is not yet as efficient at the breast as you hoped. Over-full breasts reduce milk production. Keep your breasts comfortable by expressing a little more, until you’re ready to experiment with reducing expressing again.Expect some steps backwards, as well as forward.Babies who are finding breastfeeding hard work will do their best job when they’re in their best state: healthy, well-rested and calm. Expect better feeding early in the day, and for things to feel like they’re falling apart when they’re tired, frustrated, or in a bad mood. Anyone can have a bad day, including babies!If a breastfeeding session isn’t going well, you can always hit “pause”, and offer a supplement instead. There’s no point forcing it, if both of you are upset. The next feed, or the next day, might go better. If it doesn’t, take a break, and talk to your breastfeeding helper about what to do next.Track changes. It’s helpful to collect some ‘data’ as you go along. This helps you, and your breastfeeding supporter, see how things are changing over time. You don’t need to go into huge detail – daily totals are fine. You could use an app, a spreadsheet or just a piece of paper, to record:How much expressed milk, donor milk or formula you used each dayHow many times your baby breastfedYour baby’s wet and dirty nappiesThis, along with your baby’s weights recorded in their red book, will give you enough information to tell how your plan is working.Reducing supplements is like crossing over a bridge which looks a bit rickety.You’re not quite sure if it will hold you up. You don’t jump straight into the middle – you take one step at a time, checking it’s holding your weight, before you take the next one. If it starts to give way – you jump backwards!Just like breastfeeding, reducing supplements is an art. You need plenty of patience, and good support. Many mothers in our groups have been through this process, and would love to encourage you. Maybe you will get all the way to your goal – such as exclusively breastfeeding your baby, or feeding them only on your milk – or maybe you won’t. However it turns out, you can find a way of feeding that works for you and your baby, and which you can both enjoy. Whatever feeding looks like for you, we’re here to help.Written by Jayne Joyce, March 2023.

"All parents have a unique relationship with their baby, which grows and develops as their baby does. A  breastfeeding mother builds a special relationship  with her baby through the act of breastfeeding. But  children build important relationships with other adults  in their lives, beginning with those they see most often.This may be the baby’s biological father, but it can be anyone  else who lives with mother and baby and who is a constant  presence in their lives. LLL recognises that families come in many  different shapes and sizes. In most relationships there will be a  non-breastfeeding partner although sometimes both partners  may breastfeed. An LLL Leader can give you more information  about this option.A different personYou are different from your breastfeeding partner, with a different  feel, a different sound and a different smell. At the end of a long  day a new and different person with a fresh pair of arms may be  just what is needed to settle your tired and fractious baby.Carrying and comfortingThe love hormone oxytocin, released when a mother breastfeeds,  promotes a feeling of closeness and connection with her baby.  But oxytocin isn’t limited to just nursing mothers. It works in a similar  way when you hold, cuddle and care for your baby. A great way to experience continuous close contact with your baby is to use a carrier  or sling. Babies usually love them and it’s a handy way to settle a baby.  At times when your baby is fussy or uncomfortable and nothing else  works, you might also try the colic hold.Breastfeeding—the obvious choiceBreastfeeding is the normal way to feed and comfort a baby.  It is protective against asthma, coeliac disease, cot death,  diabetes, diarrhoea and tummy upsets, ear infections and  heart disease, to name but a few. What is more, the practical  everyday benefits include:No getting up to prepare bottles during the night.Sweet smelling nappies.No feeding equipment and expensive formula to buy for your baby.Less to take with you when you go out as a family.Early DaysIn the early days, your baby will probably want to breastfeed a lot of the time he’s awake. At this stage, your partner may only be  managing to eat, sleep and nurse the baby. This is normal. At first  his mum and nursing will be the centre of your baby’s world. A  baby’s bond with his mother is the basis for all other relationships.  Encouraging that bond will strengthen his love for you later.As life settles downYou and your partner will probably both need time to adjust to  your new roles. Many couples say they didn’t feel prepared for  the emotional upheaval they experienced on becoming parents.  A breastfeeding mother usually feels an intense connection with  her baby, both emotionally and physically, due to breastfeeding  hormones and the practical need to stay close to feed the baby. It  can be easy to feel a bit left out of this. Getting involved in practical  ways such as nappy changes, baths, walks and playtimes will help  you bond with your baby. Caring for your baby teaches them that love comes from interacting with people as well as from food. Your  partner will love you for it and so will your baby.Maintaining your closeness as a coupleAlmost every sexual relationship changes with the birth of a baby.  Daily life can be exhausting and your partner may need time to  recover physically. Resuming your sex life together may take  time, but simple gestures like kissing, holding hands and sitting alongside her as she nurses your baby can keep you connected  and remind you of your love for one another.Support for youSometimes there is so much focus on the health and well-being of mum and baby that partners may be overlooked. Post-natal depression can affect either person in a couple, especially after a  difficult birth. Tell your partner and seek help from your GP if you are in this situationWhat partners can doYour partner needs practical help and emotional support while recovering from the birth.Mum and baby need to establish a strong bond, plentiful milk production and an enjoyable breastfeeding relationship. You  can help this happen with your attitude, actions and words:Support mother-baby bonding.The  most important thing you can do for your  baby’s future health and well-being is to  be a breastfeeding advocate.Make the most of your parental  leave.Take as long as you can manage.  Take it when the new mum and baby  would otherwise be at home alone.  Concentrate just on the needs of your  partner, baby and any other children. Let  everything else wait.Fix it so the household ‘ticks over’.Take  charge and welcome help from others.  You could also buy in help: a cleaner,  supermarket delivery, mother’s help.Guard against too many visitors.Let others know when your new little  family needs to be alone. Protect mum  and baby from over-enthusiastic visitors  and callers, and try to ensure you all  have some peaceful uninterrupted time  together. Turn off the phone and put a  ‘do not disturb’ sign on the front door.Look after your other children.Provide fun activities and opportunity  for exercise. Try to meet their needs for  attention, sleep and healthy food.Protect your partnerfrom well meaning  but unhelpful advice that undermines  breastfeeding—even if it comes from your own mum!Seek skilled helpif any breastfeeding  problems crop up. Problems are more  easily solved if you call for help straight  away. Problems with soreness or not  enough milk can usually be fixed easily if  you track down the right help early on. So  keep looking until you find that help. New  mums are often given a contact number  for a breastfeeding counsellor or peer  supporter. Encourage your partner to give  her a call.Respect your partner’s instincts.Nature isn’t daft and maternal instincts  have ensured the survival of our species  for millions of years. A new mum’s  hormones motivate her to mother her  baby through breastfeeding.Fight off any pressure to separate  mum and baby.Help mum and baby  spend lots of time snuggling together in  the hours and days after birth.Search for details of local mums’  breastfeeding groups.Encourage  your partner to attend before and after  birth so she gets this vital mother-to mother contact. She will get ongoing  support to carry on breastfeeding as  long as she and baby want. It can make  all the difference.Admire and praise your baby’s  mother.Your love and encouragement  will work wonders.Firmly resist pressuresto feed baby  anything other than mum’s own milk  before he is six months old. Your baby doesn’t need other foods until they can sit up and begin to feed themselves. Even then, breastmilk carries on being an important  food for older babies and toddlers.Meet your baby’s need for you.Spend time with your baby and enjoy  building your own unique relationship.Getting helpLLL Leaders are skilled at helping new  mothers.

"Mothers have successfully fed their children for thousands of years of human history without understanding how it works. It’s a bit like driving a car – as long as it’s working well, you don’t need to know what is going on under the bonnet!If you are having breastfeeding problems, such aslow milk supplyortoo much milk, or are wondering why your baby’s feeding pattern is different from what you expected, it can help to understand more about the science of lactation (producing milk).Most of the research that has ever been done on breastfeeding and human milk has been done in the last few years. It is a very exciting time for lactation science. Lots of things that experienced mothers have always known turn out to have a clear basis in the anatomy of the breast and the science of milk production, for example:Each baby and mother pair is differentHealthy babies are the best judges of when and how to feedThe way to make more milk is to remove more milkGetting ready – the developing breastBreast development starts around the age of 10-12 years. From puberty, the breast grows a little with each menstrual cycle. Inside the breast, the branches and buds that will become milk ducts and alveoli (milk storage sacs) start to develop. Radiation or trauma to the chest at this stage can have an impact on later breast development.Lactation begins – pregnancyFor many women, tender breasts are an early sign of pregnancy. The breast completes its development during pregnancy, and milk production begins in the middle trimester. If a pregnancy ends after 15-16 weeks, colostrum (early milk) will be present. Some women choose toexpress colostrum in the last few weeks of pregnancy. This is recommended for women with diabetes, whose milk may be a bit slower to increase and whose babies may have low blood sugar after birth.1Colostrum expressed before birth can be stored, to be given to the baby if they need extra milk. Mothers with high-risk pregnancies, or who are concerned about having enough milk, may also choose to express colostrum in the last weeks of pregnancy. It is usually recommended not to start before 36 weeks, unless premature birth is imminent. The amount of colostrum you can express before birth does not predict your ability to make enough milk afterwards.After birth (day 1-3)– lactation takes off!During pregnancy, milk production is held in check by the hormone progesterone, produced by the placenta. Once the baby is born and the placenta is delivered, levels of progesterone drop rapidly; this, coupled with high levels of prolactin, allows lactation to begin fully.Retained placental fragments can reduce or even stop milk production. If you have unexplained low milk production and are still bleeding heavily or irregularly after you would expect to have stopped, check with your midwifery team or doctor. Removal of the last fragments of placenta will usually allow milk production to resume normally.Mothers typically start to notice the signs of “onset of copious milk production” (also known as milk “coming in”) two or three days after birth. For a day or two you might experience:Breast tendernessWarmthDiscomfortSwellingIncrease in breast sizeMild feverThe discomfort you feel is primarily due to tissue swelling, in response to the sudden increase in milk volumes. Don’t panic – your breasts won’t feel like this for long! As your breasts adjust to making the amount of milk your baby needs, the swelling will settle down. If feeding your baby or expressing milk doesn’t quickly help you feel more comfortable, there are other steps you can take todeal with engorgement.Onset of copious milk production can happen a bit more slowly:For first-time mothersAfter a more difficult birthYou may have read that being overweight or obese (having a higher BMI, especially over 30) can lead to breastfeeding problems. It is not clear whether having a higher BMI, by itself, is a problem for breastfeeding and many women with high BMI breastfeed easily. We do know that some conditions associated with higher BMI, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, may delay your milk “coming in” (increasing in volume) in the early days after birth. This can make breastfeeding more challenging.To make milk, remove milk (day 3-4 onwards)Until day 3-4, milk production is controlled entirely by hormones and will happen automatically, whether or not you go on to breastfeed. After day 3-4, another mechanism comes into play. Milk will only continue to be made if milk is removed from the breasts. The more milk that is removed, the more milk will be made. This enables your body to adapt to the number of babies you have. With enough milk removal, it is possible to exclusively breastfeed twins or triplets! If you do not breastfeed or express milk at all, your milk production will shut down within about two weeks after birth.Remove milk earlyThe amount of milk that is removed in the period immediately after birth is important for later milk production. Research on lactation after premature birth has shown that starting to express milk within an hour of birth, compared with starting at six hours, is associated with more milk six weeks later.2If your baby has any risk factors for not being able to feed effectively at first, such as being:PrematureSmall for gestational ageUnwellJaundicedSleepySeparated from youthen early, frequent milk expression will help to ensure plenty of milk to meet their needs, now and later. You can see a useful video about thishere:Parents who haverisk factors for low milk supplycan give their milk production the best possible start by removing milk early and frequently after birth.Risk factors include:Previous history of low milk productionPrevious breast radiation or surgeryPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)Thyroid problems (hypo- or hyper-)A history of infertility with hormonal causeUnevenly sized, widely spaced breasts, with little or no changes during or after pregnancyObesity (BMI over 30)People with these risk factors may be able to make a full or partial milk supply – you never know what you can do until you try! If you are not producing all the milk your baby needs, you can still enjoy a close, happy feeding relationship with your baby. You can read more about how to use donor breastmilk or formula milk to support breastfeedinghere.Some mothers who need to supplement their own supply with donor milk or formula milk in the early months are able to reduce or eliminate the supplementary milk after their baby starts complementary foods, at around six months, going on to happily breastfeed alongside solids.Remove milk oftenAfter their first feed and a few hours of sleep, full-term, healthy newborn babies feed frequently, around the clock. Most babies need to feed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours in the early weeks, suckling and swallowing actively at each feed, to get enough milk and stimulate their mother’s milk production. If your baby is not feeding as often or energetically as this yet, it is important toexpress your milk, if your goal is a full milk supply.As milk builds up in the breast, a protein in the milk, known as the “Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation” (FIL), begins to slow down milk production. Breasts that are full make milk slowly, and eventually not at all. Breasts that are well drained make milk quickly. This is why, if you are trying to maximise milk production, it is important not to wait until your breasts feel full before feeding or expressing. Over time, this will reduce milk production.Different breasts, different feeding patternsStorage capacityis quite a new concept in breastfeeding, and it explains a lot of things that mothers instinctively knew, but were not in the textbooks!3A mother’s storage capacity is the amount of milk that her breasts canholdbetween feeds. It isnotrelated to breast size and it isnotrelated to the total amount of milk that a mother can make each day.To understand storage capacity, let’s assume that:Alisha and Beth both have 3 month old babies and well established milk supplies.Alisha’s breasts can hold 75ml of milk and Beth’s breasts can hold 150ml of milk.Both their babies need about 750ml of milk per day (this is an average amount. Some babies might take as much as 1200ml per day).Alisha’s baby needs to feed at least 10 times in 24 hours to get this amount of milk, while Beth’s baby could get the same amount of milk in only five or six feeds. [Feeding this infrequently is not common – it is at one end of a wide spectrum of feeding patterns!]Both babies are getting as much milk as they need and growing well, but they have very different feeding patterns. What happens if Alisha and Beth are told that their babies “should” both be feeding eight times in 24 hours?Alisha’s baby is hungry and miserable. She is no longer getting enough milk and if this continues, Alisha’s milk production will slow down due to the action of FIL in the full breast. It might be hard to increase milk production again, after the early weeks, when milk supply settles at a stable level.Beth’s baby is irritable because his mother keeps trying to feed him again when he doesn’t want any more milk!Both Alisha and Beth can successfully breastfeed their babies as long as their feeding pattern works for their milk storage capacity.Beth, with her larger storage capacity, has more flexibility in her feeding patterns. Her baby is likely to have fewer feeds per day than Alisha’s, is more likely only to take one breast per feed and may start sleeping for longer stretches earlier. She could choose to feed more often, if her baby wanted to.Alisha has less flexibility in her feeding patterns because if she doesn’t feed often enough, her breasts fill up and she doesn’t have room to make more milk. Her baby is likely to feed frequently day and night during the exclusive breastfeeding period and may need to feed on both breasts at most feeds.Most babies need to feed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours and it is important to ensure frequent feeding during the early weeks, when milk production is becoming established. After the early weeks, most babies spend less total time feeding, as efficiency improves. Some babies will also significantly reduce the frequency of feeds.Most mothers never need to worry or even think about their breast storage capacity, because their babies are brilliant at working it out for them! Full-term, healthy, thriving babies are able to choose their own feeding pattern that works with their mother’s breasts and their own needs as they grow. . If your baby is growing well and seems contented, their feeding pattern is working well for them.Fat in milkThis is a topic that often worries parents, because of poorly understood information circulating among families about the differences between “foremilk” and “hindmilk”.We know from research that:The breast makes milk fat at a stable level. The types of fat in milk are somewhat related to the types of fat in the mother’s diet, but the amount of fat is not related to her diet.The milk available at the start of a feed (often referred to as foremilk) has a lower level of fat than the milk at the end of the feed (often referred to as hindmilk). As the breast is drained, fat levels in milk increase as more fat droplets are “squeezed” to the front of the breast and out through the nipple.The level of the fat at the start of one feed depends on how long it has been since the last feed. The longer the interval between feeds, the lower the level of fat at the start of the next feed.Parents often worry, or are told, that their baby might not get enough fat (this is often described as “getting too much foremilk”)Research shows that full-term, healthy, thriving babies are brilliant at balancing their own diets. They will stop feeding when they have had enough calories. When fat levels in milk are higher, they will take less milk. When fat levels are lower, they will take more. The varying amount of fat in milk is not a problem – all the milk is good! It enables babies to quench their thirst at the start of a feed and finish with a creamy “dessert”, if they want to.The balance of fat in milk can be a problem for a small number of babies, if:The baby is taken off the breast before they have had as much milk as they wanted; orThere is an overwhelming amount of milk. In this case, the baby may be growing very fast (their growth curve crosses centiles upwards on the growth chart) and may struggle with the speed of milk flow, coming off the breast gagging, spluttering and upset. You can find practical tips to help your baby manage fast milk flowhere.In either of these two situations, the baby may not get enough fat to slow down the transit of milk through their gut. Milk may rush through the gut faster than the baby can digest the milk sugar (lactose). The sugar ferments in the gut, producing green, frothy, explosive poo, flatulence (farting) and severe discomfort.A baby who does yellow poo and is comfortable does not have any problem with the balance of fat in their diet. A baby who is growing more slowly than expected needs more milk overall, not just more fat. These babies should be seen by a doctor to rule out an underlying health problem.You can read more about fat levels in milkhere.How much milk?In the first 24 hours after birth, volumes of colostrum are small, but enough for your baby. The average amount per feed is about 7ml (1 ½ teaspoons). This is because full-term babies are not hungry – they are born with food stores in their body. They don’t need fluid – they shed extra fluid in the first few days (this is why most babies lose a little weight). Colostrum is primarily immune protection, rather than food. It coats the inside of the baby’s gut to keep pathogens out, stimulates the baby’s immune system, and provides the baby with a powerful, tailor-made dose of growth factors, hormones, live immune cells and other components that no manufactured milk can begin to match.The small quantity and thick texture of colostrum give the baby a chance to practice feeding before they have to manage larger volumes. The amount of colostrum increases quickly, more or less doubling every day in the first few days. If you need to express on the first day after birth, you might use a syringe to catch drops. A syringe quickly becomes too small for the increasing volumes. By the 5thday after birth a baby might be taking 60ml (2oz) or more per feed.If you are expressing your milk, for example because your baby was born early, it can help to know how much to aim for:500ml in 24 hours by the end of the first week after birth750ml in 24 hours by the end of the second or third week after birthYour baby might not need this much milk yet, but aiming for a full supply now means you will have enough to satisfy them for the rest of their breastfeeding time.Milk production remains stable, within a range of about 600ml – 1200ml per 24 hours, from about one month after birth to six months. After the baby starts eating complementary foods, milk production starts to decrease, as milk is gradually replaced by other foods in the baby’s diet. If you are making as much milk as your baby needs at one month, you are likely to keep on doing so, as long as your baby keeps on removing enough milk and you don’t get pregnant or use one of a small number of medications that can affect milk production. Birth control methods that contain progesterone may reduce milk production in some women.4How milk changesIf you are expressing your milk, you will be able to see the change from sticky, transparent, yellow or orange colostrum to thinner, white or blue-ish “transitional milk” by about the fourth day after birth. The composition of your milk is changing to adapt to your baby’s need for more energy. Your milk changes from day to day for as long as you breastfeed or express, responding to your baby’s stage of development, any illnesses you or your baby are in contact with, and even the time of day or night it was made.5The milk of mothers who give birth prematurely is initially different from the milk of mothers who give birth at full term, to meet the extra needs of their babies.Getting back on track after a difficult startMilk production peaks by about a month after birth, with most of the increase happening in the first two weeks. Many mothers find it becomes more difficult – in some cases impossible – to increase the amount of milk they are making, after the early weeks. This is why it is important to get good feeding support early, if there are any signs that there might be a problem with your baby getting enough milk, for example, if your baby:Does not poo every day (in the first 4-6 weeks)Has pink crystals (urates) in their nappy after the third dayIs not doing yellow poo by the end of the fourth dayLoses more than 7% of their birth weight by the fifth dayLoses weight after the fifth dayDoes not regain their birth weight by 10-14 daysAn LLL Leader or infant feeding specialist can help you work out whether there is likely to be a problem with milk production or whether (more commonly)your baby is not yet feeding effectively. If not enough milk is being removed, the risk is that your milk production will not increase to the level your baby needs. Expressing your milk gives you time to work on any feeding issues.If the problem is with milk production, your breastfeeding supporter can help you make a plan to keep your baby safely fed while you work tomaximise your milk supply. You will need to work closely with your baby’s healthcare providers to monitor their growth and wellbeing.Lactation beyond the early monthsParents are sometimes told that their milk has no value to their baby after 6 months, or 12 months.This is not the case.Milk is the baby’s main source of protein and calories until about a year of age, and continues to contribute to the child’s health and nutrition through the second year and beyond.Your milk adapts to meet your baby’s needs as they grow. For example:From about six months, the digestive enzyme amylase starts to be present in milk, helping your baby digest starchy foods.From about six months, levels of the antibacterial enzyme lysozyme increase in milk, protecting your baby as they put foods and other objects in their mouth.As the total amount of milk begins to decrease gradually, from about six months, levels of key immune factors such as immunoglobulins increase, so that the child receives about the same amount per day, even though they take less milk.Levels of fat, protein and energy in milk are higher in the second year than in the first year of lactation.67Lactation ends – involutionMilk will continue to be made in the breast for as long as milk is removed from the breast. In the early days of lactation, milk supply is relatively fragile – the mother’s body quickly shuts down production if milk removal stops. In later lactation, milk production is much more robust. Mothers returning to work after six months, for example, can be confident that their milk supply will withstand variations in their schedule from day to day and week to week. In later lactation it is possible to breastfeed part-time, even if you work shifts or need to travel away overnight. Many breastfeeding toddlers and older children spend time away overnight with a non-resident parent, grandparents, etc. and continue breastfeeding when they are with their mother.It takes at least 40 days for the breast to reach complete “involution” (a non-lactating state) after the end of breastfeeding or milk expression. Some mothers find that they leak or can express drops of milk months or even years after their last feed. If the amount of milk is large, or you start making milk again after a gap even though you are not pregnant, check with your doctor. Spontaneous milk secretion (galactorrhoea) can be a side effect of some medications, or a sign of hormonal dysfunction.When children are able to wean from the breast at their own pace, weaning often takes place over a period of months and years. The most common time for children to choose to stop breastfeeding is between their second and third birthdays.8Milk production reduces gradually and, by the time the child has their final feed, may have dwindled to almost nothing. Some of the immune components of milk become more concentrated as milk volumes decrease, so the child continues to benefit to the last drop of breastmilk.Written by Jayne Joyce, LLL Oxfordshire and Karla Napier, LLL Edinburgh – February 2021Endnotes:1Forster, D.A. et al.

"Is your milk supply really low?New mothers who are learning to breastfeed often worry that they might not be making enough milk for their baby. Their breasts might stop feeling full and their baby might sometimes be unsettled, or not want to be put down between feeds. There are many reasons for babies to be unsettled and breasts usually get softer after the first few weeks – these are not proof of low milk supply. If your baby is growing as expected (at least 20-30g a day, on average, during the first three months) just on your milk, then your milk supply is fine. If your baby does not grow well on your milk alone, then you may be making less milk than your baby needs.The most common reason for genuine low milk supply is a slow start with breastfeeding, when not enough milk was removed from your breasts in the early days after birth. It may be possible to turn this around, with prompt action. Some other causes of low milk supply, such as previous breast surgery and some hormonal conditions, may mean that there is a limit to how much milk you can produce.Many nursing parents can make more milk than they are making, and you never know what you can do until you try!Increasing low milk supply is hard work.It takes time, energy and commitment. It is important to be realistic from the start about your goal and how much time and energy you are able to invest. It works best when you have lots of practical and emotional support, so you can concentrate on your baby and your milk supply. Remember that this won’t be forever – it is a short-term investment for long-term gain. Set yourself short-term goals, e.g. 48-72 hours, then review your progress. If you are not able to increase your milk supply as much as you would like, or decide that it is not realistic to try, you can still have a close, happy feeding relationship with your baby.While you are working on your milk supply:Find skilled feeding support.LLL is here to help! You can find information about ways we can support youhere. We can also help you connect with other women who have experienced low milk supply.Track how you are doing.Keep a record of how much milk you express and the amount of formula or donated breastmilk your baby takes (if relevant) and how many wet and dirty nappies your baby produces. Tracking changes over time is useful to show how well your plan is working and can help you decide what to do next.Monitor your baby’s health and growth. Your baby needs to be weighed regularly while you are working on your milk supply. Your midwifery or health visiting team will usually do this. For more complex feeding issues, you may be referred to a local specialist infant feeding team or clinic.Any baby who is not growing as expected should be under the care of a doctor.This is because occasionally, slow growth can be caused by underlying health issues in the baby, rather than low milk supply.How milk production worksMilk production starts in the middle trimester of pregnancy. After birth, milk continues to be made in the breasts in response to milk being removed. The most common reason for low milk production is a slow start with breastfeeding – not enough milk being removed from the breasts in the early days after birth.Milk supply usually reaches its peak around four weeks after birth, with most of the increase happening in the first two weeks. If not enough milk is removed during this time, your breasts may end up making less milk than your baby needs. It may be possible to increase milk production, by removing more milk from your breasts. The earlier you start this, and the more energy you put into it, the higher your chances of making more milk. Even if more time has passed, it may still be possible to increase your milk production to some extent, but unfortunately there is no guarantee of being able to make a full milk supply.Any amount of milk you are able to produce is valuable to your baby. Breastfeeding is about much more than just milk and you can enjoy nurturing your baby at the breast, however much milk you are making.For more detailed information about how milk production works seeHow Milk Production Works.Risk factors for low milk supplyThese include:Previous breast surgery (especially reduction) or radiationRetained placentaUnusually small/thin/unequally sized/widely spaced breastsA history of infertility with hormonal causeHormonal conditions like thyroid problems or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).If you have any risk factors for low milk supply, you may be referred to an infant feeding specialist. Some of these conditions are treatable. Even if you have underlying factors that can’t be treated, you may still be able to make more milk than you are currently making.Effective attachmentA baby who isn’t deeply attached at the breast may not be able to get enough milk, and feeding may also be uncomfortable for you. Squashed (“new lipstick”) nipples after a feed, skin damage and pain that lasts throughout feeds are all signs of shallow attachment. You can read more about positioning and attachmenthere.Face to face help (including via video call) is usually best when working on attachment. If feeding doesn’t become more comfortable and/or effective even with skilled help, your baby may be referred for an oral assessment (a thorough examination of their mouth) to check for tongue tie, which is a problem for a small number of babies and can be treated. You can read more about thishereandhere.Hold your baby skin to skinThis helps your milk-making hormones to work well, keeps your baby calm and happy, helps you and your baby feel connected and encourages interest in feeding. You can read more about holding your baby skin to skinhere.How often and when to feedWhile you are working to increase your milk supply, you will want to encourage your baby to feed as often as possible. Signs of interest in feeding include your baby turning their head and opening their mouth (rooting), licking lips, mouthing hands, restlessness and making small sounds. Try to offer a feed when your baby is first interested, before they become upset. If your breasts are feeling full or you just feel like feeding your baby, you can offer your baby a feed, even if they are not asking.You may want to avoid using a dummy, a baby swing, or swaddling your baby, as these can make it difficult to tell if your baby is interested in feeding.Don’t give your baby water, tea or any other non-milk drinks.Breastfeeds don’t have to be regular (e.g. every 2-3 hours). Your baby just needs to have enough feeds in 24 hours, whenever they are awake enough and interested. Most young babies need at least 8-12 feeds in 24 hours. Don’t watch the clock – watch your baby and count feeds.Keep your baby feeding actively when they are at the breastKnowing when your baby is feeding actively at the breast, with deep sucks and swallowing after every one-two sucks, can be very helpful. While you are working to increase your milk supply, you will want to make sure that milk is removed from your breasts as effectively as possible. If your baby is mostly doing light, fluttery sucks with very little swallowing (three or more sucks per swallow), they are not removing much milk. If your goal is to increase the amount of milk removed from your breasts, you may want to end the feed and use a breast pump instead to maximise efficient milk removal.Breast compressions and switching sides can help to keep your baby actively feeding for longer. Start compressing your breast as soon as your baby stops actively feeding. You can read about how to do compressionshere. When your baby is no longer actively feeding even with compressions, repeat on the other side. Offer as many breasts as your baby will take – it can be more than two!Some babies seem to want to feed all the time and protest when you take them off the breast. If they are not growing well, it may be because they are not yet breastfeeding effectively. To increase your milk supply, you may temporarily need to limit their time at the breast, to give you more time to express your milk.Increasing breast stimulation by expressing your milkIf the steps above do not result in increased milk supply, the next step is to increase stimulation of your breasts by expressing your milk:An LLL Leader and/or your local infant feeding specialist will agree with you how many times in 24 hours to aim for at first. For more impact, you can increase the number of sessions. For maximum effect, you would aim to express 8-12 times in 24 hours (this is the number of times most babies need to feed).A double electric breast pump, preferably a large “hospital grade” pump, is usually the best tool for this job. Smaller single electric and manual pumps are designed for occasional expressing, not the big task of increasing milk supply.You don’t need to pump after set intervals (most babies don’t feed after set intervals either), just as often as you can. The important thing is how many times you express in 24 hours – it’s up to you when you do it. It’s fine to take a break for a few hours to go out or to sleep! More, shorter expressions often work better than fewer, longer ones and it’s fine to stop in the middle of pumping, if you need to do something. Even if you only have a few minutes, it’s worth pumping. Notice the times of day or night when you can express most and aim to pump more often then. First thing in the morning and in the quiet hours of the night can work well. Experiment to see what works best.Use your hands as well as your pump. Try massaging your breasts before and during pumping. You might want to buy or make a “hands-free pumping bra” to hold your pump in place. Some women find that they can express lots of milk by hand after they have finished pumping. You can see how to use your hands to express more milk in thisFirst Dropletsvideo.Subtitled version reproduced for LLLGB use, with permission © Dr Jane MortonTry covering the collection bottle with a sock so you can’t see it. Frustration about how slowly it is filling with milk can make it even slower!Try visualisation, e.g. a flowing fountain, or milk pouring into a bottle.Many women find that they get most milk in the first few minutes of pumping. To make the most of this, it can work well to pump very frequently for short periods, stopping and starting as many times as possible. This is sometimes called ‘power pumping’.Try pumping with a piece of your baby’s clothing near enough to smell, or while looking at your baby, or holding your baby skin to skin.You can find more tips on how to express milkhere.Balancing breastfeeding and expressingThe priority at this stage is to increase your baby’s milk intake and your milk supply.This may mean limiting your baby’s time at the breast, for now, to free up enough time to express.Your baby has lots of time to learn to breastfeed. Your milk supply will become more difficult to increase as time goes on, so it is important to act quickly. This might feel all wrong – you want to breastfeed, not pump! Remember that it is an investment of your time now to help your baby breastfeed later. As your milk supply increases, breastfeeding will get easier and more rewarding for your baby. When breastfeeding is going well, you will be able to let your baby feed as much as they want.How to feed expressed milk to your babyThere are lots of options – an LLL Leader can help you choose some to try, includingpaced bottle feedingand more,cup feeding, andat-breast supplementers(lactation aid).Keeping the breast a happy place for your babyIf your baby is upset, try offering some extra milk before offering the breast. This helps your baby to associate the breast with feeling full and happy, rather than hungry and frustrated.Babies enjoy ending a feed by falling asleep at the breast. You can offer expressed or formula milk between breasts, allowing your baby to finish with the second breast.You can give milk by bottle or cup with your baby’s cheek against your breast.If a supplementer is used, your baby can drink expressed milk while breastfeeding.DomperidoneThis is a prescription medication that can help to increase milk supply in some women, whilst they are taking the tablets. It is not suitable for everyone, e.g. it is not safe for those with certain heart conditions. Because of this, doctors are currently discouraged from prescribing domperidone to anyone. However, the NHS states that domperidone may be appropriate in some cases, so if you would like to try it, it’s worth discussing with your GP, and taking along someinformationfor them to read.The most important thing to do to increase milk supply is to remove more milk from your breasts, so don’t worry if you can’t or prefer not to take domperidone.Formula milkSome babies need extra milk for a short time or longer term if their mother is not making a full milk supply. If donated human milk is not available, the only safe alternative is infant formula milk. You can find LLLGB’s information on milk sharinghere.It is never safe tosuddenlystop or reduce supplements of formula or donor breastmilk.This needs to be done gradually, to allow your own milk supply time to increase. and it is very important that your baby is weighed regularly, to make sure that they continue to get enough milk. It would usually be appropriate to weigh your baby every 1-2 weeks while working on reducing supplements. You can read about how to use donor milk or formula to support breastfeedinghere.Whether or not you are producing all the milk your baby needs, you can still have a great feeding relationship with your baby.The breast can still work beautifully to calm, comfort and soothe your baby, even if your milk supply remains low. Any amount of your milk that your baby gets will be beneficial to them. Some of the immune components of milk become concentrated so that babies get the same amount, no matter how much of your milk they get each day. Whatever feeding looks like for you and your baby, we are here to support you.SummaryStage 1 – make sure your baby is feeding as effectively as possibleConsider risk factors for low milk supply.Make sure that your baby is well positioned and attached at the breast. This will include checking for any reason the baby might not be able to attach and feed well (e.g. tongue tie).Hold your baby skin to skin as much as possible.Offer the breast as soon as your baby shows any signs of interest in feeding, at least 8-12 times in 24 hours, waking baby if necessary.Switch sides and use breast compressions to increase milk flow.Stage 2 – if milk supply has not increased enoughExpress your milk at a frequency agreed with an LLL Leader and/or infant feeding specialist.If your baby is still not growing well, increase the number of expressions. For maximum effect, aim for at least 8 times in 24 hours. This may mean temporarily limiting your baby’s time at the breast, to give you enough time to express.Feed as much expressed milk as your baby wants to drink by cup, paced bottle-feeding, finger feeding or nursing supplementer.Aim to keep your baby’s time at the breast happy and relaxed, and to end feeds with your baby at the breast (if necessary, after giving your baby extra milk at the start or in the middle of the feed) as often as you can.Consider using the medication domperidone, which may help increase your milk supply.If necessary, use enough formula milk to make sure your baby grows as expected and seems satisfied.Further readingGetting breastfeeding back on track after a difficult startHow milk production worksMy baby needs more milkExpressing your milkRelactation and induced lactation– bringing back milk supply after a break or bringing in a milk supply when you haven’t been pregnant.BooksMaking More Milk, by Diana West & Lisa Marasco(2019)Defining Your Own Success: Breastfeeding After Breast Reduction Surgery by Diana West(2001)Breastfeeding Without Birthing by Alyssa Schnell– for non-gestational parents who are inducing lactation.Written by Jayne Joyce and Emily Tammam, LLL Oxfordshire, February 2021",https://laleche.org.uk/how-to-increase-your-milk-supply/,How to increase your milk supply
"Breastfeeding at night is one of the most discussed topics at La Leche League meetings, both in person and online. This is often because breastfeeding at night, especially in the early days, can be so important to establishing a successful breastfeeding relationship. It is also because of its inextricable link with the topic of sleep, which can be one of the biggest changes many mothers and families experience when they have a new child.There is no doubt that caring for a new baby can be exhausting, especially if you feel you are not getting enough sleep. Understanding why breastfeeding at night is so important can help. There is a huge amount of both reliable and rather less reliable information on the internet and in countless parenting books about what infant sleep ‘ought’ to be like, and therefore what infant night-time feeding ‘ought’ to be like. This article is designed to give mothers and parents the information and reassurance they need to inform their own night-time breastfeeding approach, including some helpful tips on how to get more rest when you can.Breastfeeding at night in the early weeks and months is normal and importantBabies wake to feed at night in the early weeks and months (and often beyond) for a number of important reasons. Breastfeeding at night is a vital part of establishing and maintaining a good milk supply and ensuring that newborn babies get all the milk they need to grow and thrive. Breastmilk works on a supply and demand basis: the more milk that is removed, the more milk your breasts make. For the majority of mothers, this means milk needs to be removed roughly every 2-3 hours in the early weeks. Although some babies may sleep for slightly longer periods overnight, perhaps 3-4 hour stretches, newborn babies will typically wake several times a night to feed. This also helps to ensure that you don’t get engorged breasts, which may lead to blocked ducts or mastitis.Newborn babies often wake to feed because their bodies have signalled that they are hungry. However, newborns (and babies and children of all ages) also wake at night for many other reasons, including being scared or uncomfortable, being hot or cold, feeling the need for comfort and connection, and so on. As adults, we have developed ways of meeting these needs ourselves – adjusting a pillow, having a sip of water, cuddling our partner. As babies have no way of independently meeting these needs, they rely on their mother or parent to meet them. Breastfeeding at night offers mothers a way of easily and conveniently meeting the vast majority of these needs in one go.Lots of research shows that night waking is the biological norm for babies.iYou can read more about ithereas well as inSweet Sleep, La Leche League International’s exhaustive publication on nights and naps for breastfeeding families. Research also shows that, overall, breastfeeding mothers get more sleep than mixed- and formula-feeding mothers. This is for a number of reasons, including the impact of natural hormones and chemicals released for baby and mother when breastfeeding at night. There is also a perception that babies who have formula milk sleep longer than breastfed babies. Evidence shows this is not the case.ii“Despite the common perception that supplementing an infant’s diet with formula milk or solid food will promote sleep, a recent study found that there was no difference in the frequency of night waking between breastfeeding and formula feeding infants aged 6-12 months old. Infants who received more milk or solid feeds during the day were less likely to feed at night but not less likely to wake.”iiiBreastmilk at nightResearch shows that breastmilk changes all the time, in response to all sorts of things, like the needs and health of your baby, temperature, and the time of day. For most mothers, breastmilk will gradually increase in fat content throughout the day. During the evening, young babies often cluster feed, taking in frequent feeds of this fattier milk, which tends to satisfy them enough to have their longest stretch of sleep. This cluster feeding in the early months may go on late into the evening when you were hoping you would be asleep, which can naturally feel exhausting.Overnight, your prolactin levels – the hormone designed to support milk production – are at their highest. So, when your baby feeds frequently at night, the message to your body to boost milk supply is even stronger. Breastmilk at night is also high in the amino acid tryptophan, which in turn helps your baby to make melatonin, which is used by the body to develop its circadian rhythm (our internal system for recognising the difference between day and night) and to sleep better. Hormones produced while breastfeeding also help you to relax and fall more quickly back to sleep, which may be why you find yourself nodding off so easily while breastfeeding.Given the fact that the hormones in night-time breastmilk help you and your baby to get back to sleep quickly, feeding babies to sleep is completely natural. A mother and baby’s bodies are designed to work in tandem this way. Breastfeeding your baby to sleep helps baby feel calm, safe and secure. Over time, babies stop falling asleep at the breast so easily, and eventually all babies or children stop needing the breast to fall asleep. Sleep is not a taught development, and all children get there in their own time. So, while breastfeeding to sleep continues to work, many mothers find it a wonderful, loving and responsive way to help their children doze off.Breast-sleeping / Co-sleepingSafely sharing a bed with your baby, or having your baby sleep very close to you in a sidecar cot or similar, is one way of getting more sleep and rest. The majority of other mammals sleep with their young, and our own infants are hard-wired to expect this too. For many breastfeeding mothers, learning to feed lying down and being able to fall back asleep safely with baby is when things start to feel a lot more manageable at night. Some mothers may start out nursing their babies at night sat up in bed, but many soon find that mastering breastfeeding lying on their side can really help everyone to get more sleep, especially as baby gets a bit older and can latch on by themselves. Mums can feed from both breasts when lying on one side by simply tilting their body forwards more. The same principles for getting a comfortable, deep latch apply when side-lying as when feeding upright. It may take a little practice, but overall it’s easier and less disruptive for both mother and baby at night. Research shows that breastfeeding tends to be more successful overall for mothers that co-sleep than those that keep their baby separated from them at night. You can read more about how to co-sleep or breast-sleep safely with your babyhereBreastfeeding at night after the early monthsMany mothers go through patches where their baby may wish to breastfeed more or less at night, especially within the first year. This will be related to a whole host of reasons, including growth spurts, teething, illness, and learning new skills such as sitting, crawling and walking. Like so much else with babies and children, the frequency of breastfeeds at night is not a linear progression. Phases of increased night feedings are usually relatively short-lived and you may find that co-sleeping is a really valuable tool for managing those phases. Increased periods of waking and breastfeeding around four-six months are very common and are not a sign that your baby is hungry and needs formula and/or solids. You can read more about this in our article‘What happens at four months’As your baby gets older and bigger, you may find that night feeding becomes much easier. While in the early days you may feel the need to switch on a light or sit up in bed in order to latch your baby comfortably onto your breast, as your baby gets stronger and learns to self-latch, feeding at night can be a simple matter of rolling over and putting the breast near your baby, who will manage the rest. Night feeds often become quicker too. Some mothers use breast compressions as a way of speeding up feeds. Being able to help their older baby back to sleep quickly with a breastfeed helps many mothers get the most sleep.Coping with the challengesKnowing that waking at night to breastfeed is positive for our supply and our baby, and that it is the biological norm, can often be reassuring for mothers and parents. Nevertheless, sleep deprivation can be really challenging for many families. It can feel especially hard if your baby is waking more than your friends’ babies, or if they are an older baby still waking up more than you had expected.New parents often get asked about their babies’ sleep and their approach to feeding at night. These conversations can sometimes lead to (unwanted) comments about what is normal, what you ‘should’ be doing, and how to ‘fix’ things. And if you are feeling really tired or at a low point, you may be thinking that you do need to find a ‘solution’ and try some of those suggestions. The many unhelpful sources out there setting unrealistic expectations may be undermining your self-confidence as a mother. Perhaps you’re wondering what a loving and respectful approach that suits both you and your baby would be?First, it’s important to say that you are not alone. At any point in time there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of mothers up and breastfeeding their babies – of varying ages – at night. A turning point for some of them is when they are able to relax their expectations of themselves and their babies a little. Some mothers also find that being constantly reminded of when they have been woken up is actually part of the problem, and they decide to ignore the clock and not to use their phones at night.Being responsible for all the night-feeds can feel exhausting, or even unfair. Sometimes well-intentioned comments may suggest that a partner or other care-giver could feed the baby at night with a bottle. It can be useful to remember that the hormones in night-time milk make it easier for both you and your baby to get back to sleep quickly. And since the hormones in night-time milk are made at night-time, there is some evidence that giving your baby breastmilk expressed at other times does not always have quite the same effect. It is also sometimes easy to overlook the practicalities of another care-giver taking care of night-feeds. Mothers will often wake up when their baby does anyway, and may struggle to get back to sleep if they can hear their baby being upset while waiting for a bottle to be warmed up. Most mothers will also need to pump or hand express milk during the night to protect their supply and avoid engorgement, so they are often awake anyway during the time their baby is being fed by their partner.Even though breastfeeding at night may be the responsibility of the mother alone, there are lots of ways to get supported so that things feel easier. For example, sometimes dads and partners get up with the baby first thing in the morning to give mums some extra time in bed, which can make a big difference to how tired they feel. Good communication is really helpful – ask for help with other things where you can and be clear about the kind of support you need. It’s OK not to enjoy breastfeeding every second, and it’s OK to complain about being tired: that doesn’t mean you don’t want to do it, so you can explain that asking ‘Why don’t you just stop?’ is not helpful and that you’d rather be asked ‘How can I help you find time to rest today?’If you are really struggling with tiredness, you may want to think of ways to adapt your own routines for a short while to help you get more rest – perhaps sleeping more during the day, or going to bed earlier when your baby has her first ‘longer’ stretch of sleep. It can also be a great time to join an LLL group meeting with other breastfeeding mothers, as hearing that they are experiencing the same challenges can be really reassuring. Mothers often get bombarded with unrealistic expectations of infant sleep, and it’s precisely this misalignment of expectation and reality that can cause stress.Another challenge that mothers may experience (usually once their baby is a bit older) is a feeling of nursing aversion or irritability, particularly during night-time feeds. These feelings can be very normal and are often linked to tiredness or feeling ‘touched out’. You may experience them more when your baby is waking or feeding a lot more frequently, for example when teething or feeling ill. You may also experience these feelings when there is a change in your own hormones, for example, during ovulation or your period. There is some anecdotal evidence that taking magnesium supplements can be helpful. Many mothers describe these feelings as irrational and usually short-lived; they can be a sign that you need to give yourself a little ‘self-care’ – perhaps asking for some more help during the day so that you can rest or focus on yourself.Nursing aversion can sometimes lead to feelings of guilt about not enjoying breastfeeding, and make you wonder whether it is a sign you need to stop. There are some helpful information groups on social media where mothers share their nursing aversion experiences, as well as tips and tricks that helped them overcome those feelings. Like anything in life, you may not enjoy breastfeeding every moment of every day; that’s OK. Take things one day at a time, listen to your body and your baby.Stopping breastfeeding at nightBreastfeeding at night meets a baby’s needs in a variety of ways. For many mothers, it’s the easiest way to settle their baby back to sleep when they wake at night, and they continue to use it for as long as it continues to work. It is not a bad habit and all babies eventually fall asleep and stay asleep without the breast. You may decide that you are happy with breastfeeding back to sleep, but you are feeling pressured by others’ expectations about what your baby ‘should’ be doing.Some books suggest that after six months babies no longer need night feeds. Not only is this an arbitrary figure, taking little account of the different circumstances of different babies and families, but it also has no evidence to back it up. Sometimes, mothers worry that breastfeeding at night is what is causing their baby to wake up several times. This is not the case. Babies wake for lots of reasons and it is better to think of breastfeeding as a tool that meets the vast majority of those needs. Some sources claim that babies after a certain age don’t ‘need’ breastmilk at night any longer, but breastfeeding goes on meeting a baby’s needs for a long time. Many babies will continue to need the calories from night-time breastmilk, as well as all the other comforts that it brings, for some time after six months, and sometimes well beyond.Some families may feel that their baby is ready to cut some breastfeeds at night or stop breastfeeding at night altogether. Generally speaking, the evidence seems to suggest that night-weaning is best left until after around 18 months. Many mothers find that gently cutting down feeds at this point is much easier, as the baby is learning to talk and the mother can help to explain any changes. There is helpful information about approaches to cutting down night feedshere. Any changes are best approached gradually and respectfully, so that you can preserve the important close connection to the baby at night-time. As your baby gets older, you will discover ways of being responsive to their needs at night that might not include offering your breast every time. For example, you may find that you are able to try other things like rocking, patting and shushing before offering the breast. These may not work initially, but over time, as your baby develops, you may find that in some cases these soothe him back to sleep. As always, you are the expert on your baby and you’ll be able to assess whether your child is ready to stop breastfeeding at night, or whether it would be easier to try night weaning later on.ConclusionHaving a baby, and eventually a toddler, can of course be exhausting. Since responding to your baby’s intense needs at night can feel overwhelming, being able to access reliable information about infant sleep and night-time feeding behaviour can help you adjust your expectations. You may be happy breastfeeding your baby back to sleep as often as needed, yet you may feel pressured by well-meaning comments from friends and family about what your baby’s sleep ‘should’ be like. Sometimes spending time with others who understand what you’re going through, and who are supportive or your choices, can help you feel confident to make the decisions that work for you. Chatting with other mothers at a La Leche League meeting, in person or online, about what they found helpful, and exchanging ideas for getting more sleep may help you decide what’s right for you and your baby.

"Vitamin D is a key nutrient in the maintenance of bone health in children and adults. It helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy.Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency may contribute to a number of health issues such as hypertension, diabetes type I and II, some autoimmune conditions, and some cancers.iBecause vitamin D is essential for promoting calcium absorption in the body, in a relatively small number of cases its deficiency can also lead to rickets in children, a condition that affects bone development, causing the bones to become soft and weak and potentially leading to bone deformities. In adults, rickets is known as osteomalacia or soft bones and it can lead to osteoporosis if left unchecked long term.iiBreastmilk doesn’t naturally contain high levels of vitamin D as, in the past, babies would absorb most of their vitamin D from exposure to sunlight. However, changes in the way we live our lives, with less exposure to sunlight and only a few of the foods we eat containing vitamin D (such as egg yolk, beef liver, oily fish like mackerel, tuna and salmon, as well as fortified foods like some breakfast cereals, fat spreads, and non-dairy milk alternatives), might mean that mothers may not have enough vitamin D in their own bodies to pass to their babies via breastmilk. Current recommendations that babies are not exposed to strong direct sunlight have also led to a decrease in their absorption of vitamin D. When this is combined with a mother having low levels, it further reduces the amount that passes through breastmilk.iiiGuidelines for Vitamin D intakeIn July 2016 Public Health England issued new guidelines on Vitamin D intake,ivbased on recommendations from the Government’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN). The guidelines state that although roughly one in five people has low vitamin D levels, this is not the same as a vitamin D deficiency, and most people are being asked to consider taking supplements. Specifically, PHE suggests that adults and children over the age of one consider taking a daily supplement containing 10 microgramsv(400 IU) of vitamin D, particularly during autumn and winter when the sun is not strong enough.Although some people choose not to take a supplement during the summer months when they are exposed to adequate sunshine, people who have a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, are being advised to take a supplement all year round. According to SACN’s review, at-risk groups include people whose skin gets little or no exposure to the sun, such as people who are not often outdoors or who cover their skin when they are outside. People with dark skin, from African, African-Caribbean and South Asian backgrounds, may also not get enough vitamin D from sunlight in the summer and may also want to consider taking a supplement all year round.Can I get enough Vitamin D from sunlight?Our bodies are designed to make very large amounts of vitamin D through exposure to the sun (10,000-20,000 IU in 24 hours, after 15-20 minutes of summer-sun exposure in a bathing suit or 45-60 minutes of exposure for people with darker skin tones). However, the desire to avoid overexposure and sunburn has eclipsed the ability of both children and adults to absorb adequate amounts of sunlight to keep normal levels of vitamin D.viThe NHS website says, “Most people can make enough vitamin D from being out in the sun daily for short periods with their forearms, hands or lower legs uncovered and without sunscreen from late March or early April to the end of September, especially from 11am to 3pm.A short period of time in the sun means just a few minutes – about 10 to 15 minutes is enough for most lighter-skinned people – and is less than the time it takes you to start going red or burn. Exposing yourself for longer is unlikely to provide any additional benefits.People with dark skin, such as those of African, African-Caribbean or south Asian origin, will need to spend longer in the sun to produce the same amount of vitamin D as someone with lighter skin”.viiHowever, SACN didn’t make any specific recommendations about how much sunlight people would need to get enough vitamin D, because there are a number of factors that can affect how much vitamin D is produced in the skin. For example, those living in northern climates don’t have as much chance to absorb vitamin D. Therefore, the recommendations assume “minimal sunshine exposure”.The NHS website goes on to say that it’s important not to burn in the sun and that young babies should not be exposed to strong direct sunlight. Sitting indoors by a sunny window doesn’t aid vitamin D production, as the ultraviolet B (UVB) rays can’t get through glass. Neither are sunbeds a recommended way of making vitamin D.Does my baby need Vitamin D supplements?The Department of Health currently recommends that all babies from birth to one year of age (including breastfed babies and formula-fed babies who have less than 500ml a day of infant formula, already fortified with vitamin D) and all children aged one to four years are given a supplement, whether or not you are taking a supplement yourself.Babies up to the age of one year need 8.5 to 10 micrograms (340-400 IU) of vitamin D a day. Children from the age of one year need 10 micrograms (400 IU) of vitamin D a day.The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM), a global organisation of medical doctors dedicated to the promotion of breastfeeding, recommends that“The breastfeeding infant should receive vitamin D supplementation for a year, beginning shortly after birth in doses of 10–20 mcg/day (400–800 IU/day). This supplement should be cholecalciferol, vitamin D3, because of superior absorption unless a vegetable source such as ergocaliferol vitamin D2, is desired4…”viiiKnowing that human milk is designed specifically for your baby, and is the most complete food both nutritionally and immunologically, it may seem confusing to be told a breastfed baby needs vitamin D supplements. If you choose to supplement your baby and are uncomfortable with supplementation of vitamins other than D (since your milk alone provides optimal amounts of those other nutrients), ask your doctor to recommend a vitamin D-only preparation for your baby.Can I take Vitamin D instead of giving to my baby?The ABM states that“Vitamin D also may be delivered adequately through human milk.”ixSome mothers find it preferable to take the supplement themselves rather than trying to give it directly to the baby,xalso because supplementing the baby does not address any potential deficiency in the mother, which may compromise her long-term health.According toLa Leche League International, breastfeeding mothers who have adequate amounts of vitamin D in their bodies can successfully provide enough vitamin D for their nursing children through breastmilk. However, as lifestyle changes have led to some women not having enough vitamin D, LLLI recommends that pregnant and nursing mothers obtain adequate vitamin D, or supplement as necessary.Research shows that high dose maternal vitamin D supplementation (4000-6400 IU/day or a single monthly dosage of 150,000 IU) can enrich breastmilk adequately for infants.xiOne study suggested that maternal supplementation alone may improve vitamin D intake of the nursing infant in an environment where infant supplementation rate is low.xiiAs the currently recommended safe upper limit for vitamin D intake is 4000 IU/day, it is very important to check with your doctor and have your own vitamin D status assessed by a blood test before you begin supplementing at levels higher than the current RDI of 400 IU/ day.Debates continue over what an optimal level of vitamin D is for an adult, and research has indicated that pregnant and lactating women might need more vitamin D than adults who are not bearing children.xiiiIf you are not sure whether you need a supplement, you can have a simple blood test before making a choice to supplement. Vitamin D insufficiency is represented by a blood level of less than 32 ng/mL. Those with blood levels below 20 ng/mL are considered deficient in vitamin D.xivYou may also opt to have your baby’s vitamin D level assessed with a blood test measuring 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH-D). Your baby’s doctor can help you determine whether vitamin D supplements are, indeed, warranted.Study supports maternal Vitamin D SupplementationA 2015 study by Professor Bruce Hollis, PhD, of the Medical University of South Carolina, found that “maternal vitamin D supplementation with 6400 IU/day safely supplies breast milk with adequate vitamin D to satisfy her nursing infant’s requirement and offers an alternate strategy to direct infant supplementation”.xvWhen asked by La Leche League GB if mothers should continue to take supplements once their babies were over six months old, Professor Hollis replied“The mother should continue to take the vitamin D as long as she is lactating.”He added this was because of the lack of Vitamin D in most foods.xviIf a baby is born with a deficiency in Vitamin D, due to the mother’s own low levels, this may not be reversed by the mother taking supplements.xviiToo much or too little?While there is no risk of your body making too much vitamin D from sun exposure (although the usual precautions should be taken to cover or protect skin before it turns red or starts to burn), you could get too much vitamin D through supplements. The NHS says that taking too many vitamin D supplements over a long period of time can cause too much calcium to build up in the body (hypercalcaemia). This can weaken the bones and damage the kidneys and the heart.If you choose to take vitamin D supplements, 10 micrograms (400 IU) a day is likely to be enough for most people, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly, and children aged 11 to 17 years. Children aged one to ten years should not have more than 50 micrograms (2,000 IU) a day. Infants under 12 months should not have more than 25 micrograms (1,000 IU) a day. Some people have medical conditions that mean they may not be able to safely take as much. If in doubt, you should consult a health professional to get up-to-date information on recommended doses. A medical professional will also be able to help you assess whether taking more than 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) of Vitamin D a day to provide enough for your baby through breastmilk may be harmful in your specific circumstances.Breastfeeding continues to be of significanceBreastmilk remains the optimal choice for infant nutrition, and its unique structure and functions cannot by replicated by infant formula. Your milk continually adapts throughout the day and over time to suit your baby’s needs. Human milk remains the best source of nutrition during the first year, with the appropriate introduction of complementary foods from around the age of six months, which can include foods rich in vitamin D.Your milk becomes a supplement to solids during your baby’s second year, but keeps significant nutritional value, as well as emotional benefits. There is evidence that the longer a baby is breastfed, the greater the protection from ill health and the more positive impact on their long-term health (UNICEF 2012).xviiiLow levels of Vitamin D may cause problems, not breastfeedingSome research published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2016 implied that a lack of vitamin D in breastmilk may contribute to the development of rickets.xixWhile reports occasionally give the impression that breastfeeding is causing problems, the real issue is that in today’s world women may not have enough Vitamin D themselves to pass to their babies through breastmilk.The answer is to address any possible deficiencies in that area so that babies will receive the Vitamin D they need, whether this is via Vitamin D supplements and/or regular, small amounts of exposure to sunlight, as well as through their diet once they’re old enough to have complementary foods.Coronavirus updateAlterations to our normal routine may mean that at present people may be spending more time indoors and not getting enough vitamin D. The Department of Health says people might want to consider taking 10 micrograms (400 IU) of vitamin D a day to keep their bones and muscles healthy.Compiled by Anna Burbidge for La Leche League GB, January 2021Endnotesihttps://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/vitamin-d/iiIbidemiiihttps://www.vitamindcouncil.org/further-topics/vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding/#ivScientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition: “Vitamin D and Health”, 2016 (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537616/SACN_Vitamin_D_and_Health_report.pdf)vA microgram (mcg) is 1,000 times smaller than a milligram (mg).vihttps://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/vitamin-d/viihttp://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Summerhealth/Pages/vitamin-D-sunlight.aspxviiiAcademy of Breastfeeding Medicine, “ABM Clinical Protocol #29: Iron, Zinc, and Vitamin D Supplementation During Breastfeeding”,Breastfeeding Medicine 2018, 13 (6): 398-404.

"Breastfeeding always comes to an end – at some point, every breastfed baby or child stops breastfeeding. This article looks at what happensafteryour toddler or older child weans,1how it feels for you and what it might mean for you going forward.Sometimes, because of difficulties, breastfeeding your baby comes to an end much earlier than you thought it would or than you had hoped for. And with that can come feelings of anger, guilt, sadness, hurt and disappointment. If you are currently struggling with breastfeeding ending earlier than you had hoped, we would encourage you to talk to someone – your local LLL Leader would be pleased to support you. You may also find this article of interest:Five ways to help when breastfeeding doesn’t go as expected. Amy Brown’s bookWhy Breastfeeding Grief and Trauma Matterwhich explores the deep feelings women have when breastfeeding doesn’t go to plan, may also be helpful.Will weaning happen?What is certain is that all children stop breastfeeding eventually. Children outgrow breastfeeding on their own, just as they outgrow other toddler and young child behaviours. For many families, taking the approach of being led by your child works well and the transition from breastfeeding to no longer breastfeeding is uneventful. It may all feel less noticeable if weaning takes place slowly and gently.This process of ‘natural weaning’ allows a child to develop at their own pace, giving up breastfeeding according to their own natural timing. Rather than choosing a specific time to stop breastfeeding, many mothers just continue nursing while it is working well for them and see how it goes. That might mean breastfeeding for years beyond what you expected as you first breastfed your newborn.Once weaning has happenedIf you are following your child’s lead, it is unlikely they will wean suddenly or overnight, especially if they are under one year old (see our article onNursing Strikesif you are concerned this is happening). It is really common for the natural weaning process to take a long time and feel like a few steps forward and a few back. This can feel confusing at times.It’s not uncommon for children to look like they are weaning, only to come back – often with renewed energy – to breastfeed when you least expect it or when you thought they had weaned. A new baby, an unsettled family time, a change in their days such as whenstarting preschool or school, or illness can often lead to an increase in breastfeeding just when you thought they were stopping. That can be unsettling if you are trying to decide if you are still breastfeeding or not – one day you might not be, and then the next you are again. One mother said: “I thought she was weaning and I was starting to feel the grief of it around three years old, but we are still going at four.”.‘The Last Breastfeed’ might not be a significant event. For some, weaning happens so gradually, that suddenly you realise your child hasn’t asked to nurse for a while, and you can’t remember your last breastfeed – or at least, you didn’t know it was the last time.This is often the time mothers wish they had captured more photographic memories of their toddler or child breastfeeding, not realising that soon it might be the last breastfeed. Taking photos of you and your child nursing can be really special, so you may want to consider taking more at this stage.Emotional changeThe topic of what it feels like after weaning isn’t talked about much and so you might be wondering if what you are feeling is normal. It almost always is.For many, weaning is an emotional adjustmentAs breastfeeding comes to end it can be an emotional time and mothers can experience a wide range of feelings. For some it might be a time of sadness – a sense of loss for the time that’s gone before and a sorrow that your special ‘baby days’ are passing and behind you. For others it might be a huge relief and a time you had longed for and thought would never come.Or it might be a mix of both.Perhaps one moment you may feel a sense of relief that the intensity of breastfeeding is passing and the next moment sad that this stage of motherhood is drawing to a close when it has been so important to you.The Womanly Art of Breastfeedingsays: “You may revel in your non-nursing status but also feel weepy or supersensitive for a time.”2One mother described the time of her two year old weaning as a confusing time of feeling a sense of loss but also happiness: grief and relief. Another, as her four year old weaned, said that she was completely ready to stop (and was desperate to), but then realised it meant she had to redefine how she viewed herself as she always thought of herself as a breastfeeding mother.This huge mix of emotions around your breastfeeding journey coming to an end is common. Especially if you worked so hard to make it happen in the early days. When breastfeeding has been such a central part of how you have mothered your child, it can feel like a new and perhaps uncertain stage.Distress around weaning is more likely the earlier it happens, or where it happened before you wanted or had intended. Where weaning has happened very early on, mothers can be left with deep feelings of anger, grief, sadness and disappointment. Where weaning has happened suddenly, or has been stressful, it is more likely that the emotional impact may be greater. How old your child is when they wean may not be as important to how you feel about weaning, rather the sense that things ended well. As Diane Bengson says: “Mothers who wean gradually, or who feel that weaning happened at a time when both they and their child were ready, often feel peace and contentment when weaning is complete3But even if you initiated weaning or encouraged your child to wean, you may still find moments of sadness. Even when weaning is a positive experience for both of you, ‘letting go’ can still feel emotional. Some mothers and parents describe it as nostalgia for the early times of breastfeeding your baby. Perhaps this is even more apparent if you know this is your last baby and you know you won’t be a nursing mother again.If you felt that your child initiated weaning rather than you did, and it was sooner than you had hoped for, those feeling of sadness can be stronger. Or if your toddler or older child weaned quickly, you may feel a sense of hurt or rejection. InThe Nursing Mother’s Guide to Weaning, Kathleen Huggens says:“ Even if you had planned to wean soon, you may feel surprised and a little disappointed when your child rejects you in favour of a cup or bottle.”4Or you may actually feel nothing but relief – that you are pleased to be moving on from the intensity of the early days and years and enjoying a sense of having your body back. You might be relieved to finally ditch your nursing bras and look forward to wearing clothes that no longer need easy access. You may find a sense of relief that you can sit down without being asked to nurse, and that maybe that intense need for you is easing a little – and that feels good.The key is that whatever you are feeling emotionally about weaning – it’s normal. What one mother experiences won’t necessarily be the same as another. Talking about it with others who have weaned at LLL groups (in person or online), might help.Hormonal ChangesWhen weaning happens, there is alsoa physical and hormonal adjustmentwhich, despite limited studies on the subject, seems to reflect across the experience of many. This adjustment can lead to a short time of feeling quite low, as your hormones settle down.It can be really common to feel down or weepy – or even depressed – after weaning. And for some, the feelings are strong and may mean there is a sense of anxiety, insomnia, anger, swings between high and low moods. In part, this is because of hormonal changes happening in your body as you adjust to reducing, and then no longer, making milk or having the repeated closeness of your child at your breast. Your breasts may still continue to produce milk, but gradually they will stop and for some mothers it might be months before they can no longer squeeze a few drops out.There is little research on the topic, but we know that the hormones so important in breastfeeding – prolactin (milk making hormone) and oxytocin (the hormone of love and responsible for the milk ejection reflex) – play an important role in how we feel emotionally. Both oxytocin and prolactin contribute to feelings of calm, love, relaxation, closeness and contentment. As breastfeeding ends, both prolactin and oxytocin levels will lower – and so may your mood and sense of wellbeing. It may last a few days, or it may go on for longer.So if you are feeling low or weepy after weaning, it can be reassuring to know that it is likely that your body is also dealing with hormonal changes, as well as any emotions you may have around weaning. Even if you are totally at peace with weaning and know the time is right for you both, there are changes happening in your body that might have an impact on how you feel.It has often been described as similar to how you feel hormonally as part of your menstrual cycle, but more intense and more long lasting. Others may go further and say that they feel really sad and depressed for a few weeks after weaning. Often your hormones settle within a few weeks and you and your child adjust to a new rhythm where breastfeeding is no longer part of your current story.These feelings of sadness and general lowness that can happen after weaning are normally temporary. Being gentle and patient with yourself is important. If you have ongoing low mood or depression after the initial weeks, it may be helpful to talk to your GP.How do I do ‘this’ without breastfeeding?If your child has stopped breastfeeding gradually or they have led the weaning process, you may see this as all part of the bigger picture of watching your child grow into an independent little person. Your role of mothering ‘your baby’ is changing. Perhaps your child is spending longer away from you, may be sleeping longer or on their own, and maybe there is a sense that their need for you isn’t quite so intense. That can be both a relief and an adjustment.You may feel proud of how they have grown and how much you have learnt about parenting through breastfeeding, but perhaps wonder what it means for you if you no longer have breastfeeding in the picture. Perhaps you are relieved that your breasts are no longer the focal point of your child’s day?Where breastfeeding has been important to you both, it can sometimes feel a bit uncertain about how things might go without nursing as a go-to or back-up for when parenting is tricky. How will you get them back to sleep if they wake with a bad dream in the middle of the night? How will you calm them down when the emotional whirlwind takes over them? What will you do when they bump themselves? How will you get some extra time in bed in the morning if your breast no longer offers the oasis of calm it once did?Often looking back at all your breastfeeding relationship gave you and your child, can help shape your ‘new’ picture of parenting without breastfeeding. Many mothers would say that breastfeeding their baby beyond babyhood is one of their proudest and greatest achievements. If that is the case, it might feel right to celebrate or mark the event in some way for you that feels significant – for both you and and your child. Be proud!And if you are feeling low, or missing that physical closeness, sometimes finding other ways to connect on a physical level with your child can help. If your arms are feeling “empty” without your child nursing at the breast, cuddling lots, having baths together and playing physical games with them climbing on you or rolling around together, can help with getting a hormone boost. Simple cuddles and touch, or sniffing or nuzzling your child’s head, can work wonders for having a surge of oxytocin.It’s likely your breasts and chest will be a special place for your child for a long time. Many mothers have commented how their older child still likes to place their head or hand near their breast, or when upset, will cuddle into a breastfeeding position without actually breastfeeding.Looking aheadAs you watch your child wean – be it entirely on their own, or with some gentle encouragement from you – you may find that you swing between various emotions and thoughts. Whether weaning passed uneventfully and feels like a natural end to your breastfeeding journey, or you found it an emotional and challenging time, looking back and acknowledging what you achieved and what you have given your child is something you can be rightly proud of.Breastfeeding has taught you so much about recognising your child’s needs and emotions, their demands and their wants. Your ability to nurture them, to read their cues and respond to them hasn’t changed, but it might be that instead of offering the breast, you now meet those needs in different ways. And while your baby may no longer need comfort at your breast, they still need you.Many mothers and parents look at their older children, even grown-up children, and know that the shape of their relationship has its foundation back in their nursing days. The closeness, understanding and connection that you grew together at the breast over the years, will continue – in new and different ways but shaped by your breastfeeding journey.EndnotesWeaning here describes the process of stopping breastfeeding, not the introduction of family foods which takes place around the middle of your baby’s first year.La Leche League International.The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. 8th Edition, 2010: 337.Bengson, D.

"After the first three months, many mothers start to settle into a bit of a rhythm with their baby and begin to feel like life has become a bit more predictable. Then around four months (or anywhere between three and six months), babies seem to change all over again, sometimes becoming more fussy, sleeping differently, and often being more distractible when nursing.These outward differences are a sign of the big developmental changes happening in your baby right now. Sometimes this period lasts a couple of weeks, sometimes longer. Nursing is still very important to your baby and you can find imaginative ways to keep him nursing effectively, even with all the excitement of the world around him. This phase does pass, and babies emerge much better able to multi-task and to nurse while doing other things.So what happens to a baby at this time?Every baby is different, and as with so many other developments, every child does things at their own pace. Around four months you might be witnessing the beginning of lots of changes in your baby’s physical abilities. They might have much better head control and they may be able to sit up when supported. You might also notice more social skills developing, such as smiling, cooing or babbling. Babies may also start bringing their hands to their mouth simply to explore and play, so it may not always be a feeding cue, as it was in the past. There are lots of changes on the inside too, as their brain develops: their vision is now much better, and they can more easily pick out different sounds. Sometimes babies may also start teething at this age, which can occasionally lead to temporary changes in nursing behaviour.Distractibility while nursingThe impacts of these changes can often be felt in the breastfeeding relationship. It may seem as if your baby has started nursing for much shorter periods of time. As babies get older they become much more efficient feeders, and a feed that may previously have lasted around half an hour may now take a significantly shorter time. However, the distractibility that starts at around four months for some babies may mean breastfeeds become more sporadic, especially during the day. Babies might suckle for a few moments, then turn their head at a new sound, go back to nursing, then stop to smile at mum. You may feel worried that your baby isn’t getting full feeds, especially during the day.You can find ways to help baby to have longer/fuller feeds. For example, some mothers take their baby to a quiet or darkened room to nurse. This helps by reducing the amount of distraction so that the baby can focus on nursing. Similarly, some mums try feeding in a sling, or with a cover like a muslin, so that their baby can be less distracted by what’s going on. Other mothers find that gentle movement, like bouncing on a birth ball or sitting in a spinning chair, help to keep the baby focused.In some cases, no matter what you do, daytime feeds are just less effective for a while. So, instead, you may want to focus on getting a good feed at nap times when baby may feed to sleep. Night-time nursing becomes really important too. Perhaps because it is already dark and quiet and babies are more sleepy, many mums find that their baby often feeds better at night during this time. While it may be worrying if your baby is taking less milk during daytime feeds, it is often helpful to think about their intake over a 24-hour period. Many babies instinctively take more milk at night anyway (sometimes referred to as reverse cycling) if they are nursing less in the day.You may find this distractible period hard, because your baby no longer seems comforted by the breast to the same extent, and instead seems eager to do other things. Rest assured, your baby still loves you and enjoys your milk; you are still the centre of their world. It is just that your baby’s brain is changing in wonderful ways and it has not yet matured enough to allow them to multi-task effectively. This phase will pass and your nursing relationship can continue for as long as you wish.Nursing mannersSometimes a distractible baby might start to suckle, and then twist their head to look at something interesting, which can be painful! Some mothers find it useful to begin nudging babies towards gentle nursing behaviour at this time. If baby pulls away without unlatching, mothers can gently unlatch baby and remind them that they can’t nurse and turn their head. Even though they can’t speak their understanding is growing all the time, and by repeating these messages babies understand what behaviours are acceptable.Changes in sleepAs well as nursing differently, other things like sleep can be affected. A baby that may have been sleeping longer stretches may start waking more frequently at this time. Brain developments at this stage may mean they spend less time in the deeper phases of sleep. Research shows that sleep is not a linear development and it’s common for babies and children to go through periods of more and less frequent waking. Babies will wake for lots of reasons. Sometimes because they are hungry (especially if they have nursed less during the day), but also because they are processing new experiences from the day, because of separation anxiety, illness, or simply to feel a connection with a caregiver. Teething pain can be another reason: babies may have uncomfortable gums and may wish to nurse more for pain relief, particularly at night when there is less to distract them.This can be a tiring period for mothers and parents. You may want to make some short-term changes to catch up on rest – perhaps going to bed earlier, finding a chance to nap during the day, or choosing to co-sleep with your nursling.Not the time to introduce solidsThere is a common myth that exclusively breastfed babies who are nursing less and waking more around this time might be doing so because they are hungry and breastmilk is no longer enough for them. This is not true. For the exclusively breastfed baby, breastmilk is the only source of nutrition required until at least the middle of the first year, and well beyond in conjunction with solid food. There is no need to introduce formula milk at this time. There is no evidence that introducing baby-rice or thickeners will help babies to sleep better. In fact, it may be harmful to introduce solid food before your baby’s gut has fully matured.As babies get bigger and become able to reach and grasp for things, they may start to grab the food that you are eating. Babies also start to use their hands much more to experiment and will frequently put their hands in their mouth. Again, these are not a sign that they are ready for solid food. Getting teeth through is also not a sign that your baby is ready for solids or that he no longer needs to nurse. Evidence suggests it is better to wait until baby is showing other signs of being ready for solids, like being able to sit up unaided for short periods of time. You can read more about starting solid foodhere.The UK Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby’s life and states that breastfeeding can continue to benefit your baby along with solid foods for many months after.The World Health Organizationstrongly recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and it states that after that breastfeeding should continue, along with complementary foods, for up to the age of two years or beyond and as long as mutually desired.Distractible older babySometimes babies can also become distractible between around eight and ten months. Again, this is related to normal developments that the child is going through. Sometimes parents think distractible babies at this age are weaning. Research shows that it is very unlikely that a baby under one year will self-wean. Nursing remains very important to your baby. Many of the same tactics that worked for a four-month-old may work again; for example, keeping external stimulus limited when nursing. An eight-ten month old baby will be drinking water and having some solid foods, and you may find they eat more or less during this period. Babies may also wish to nurse more at night for a while.SummaryFor some babies the developmental changes that happen around four months mean that they may become more distractible while nursing. Nursing is still very important to your baby and sometimes you may need to try some imaginative solutions for a short period in order to help your baby get full feeds. Babies may also begin to experiment with their hands in their mouth a lot more, or reach for food. This does not necessarily mean your baby is hungry, or that thickeners, baby rice or solids need to be introduced. Research shows that waiting until at least the middle of the first year is ideal to ensure your baby’s gut has matured.As with so much else, this is a phase that will pass.

"If a breastfeeding mother is summonsed to take part in jury service, she can ask for this to be deferred. See our articleBreastfeeding and Jury ServiceHowever, sometimes a breastfeeding mother is summonsed as a witness in a court case, either because she has previously provided evidence in a criminal or civil case, or because of involvement in her professional work life. It may be that she has been a witness to a road traffic accident which results in civil proceedings. In this case, either party could request a summons for her to attend.This article addresses some of the questions that arise from this.I’m on maternity leave, can I still be asked to attend court?If you are summonsed as a witness in a case, this is subject to court procedure rules and is a different situation to being asked to go into work. It’s considered a public duty and it could be that the evidence you will provide will have a crucial effect on the outcome of the case.  This may particularly apply in the areas of social work and family cases where the input you are able to give could be of crucial assistance to the judge, and the decisions made about another family’s life.  It is worth checking with your work colleagues if this is the case or if someone else might be able to attend in your place.Can’t I give a video testimony?This is rarely possible but, even if it is, you may still have to attend court just in case, on the day, other parties in the case wish to question you.I can’t leave my breastfed babyAlthough you almost certainly have to attend, you can request that special accommodation be made to keep you and the baby together, therefore maximising the quality of your evidence. In the first instance it will be worth talking to the barrister and solicitor representing the side of the case you have been called to give evidence for. This might include a representative from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in a criminal case, or a representative for the local authority in a family matter.You can explain that you need the baby to be with you to be able to breastfeed.  As with the situation if you were called for Jury Service, you can point out the possible risks from being separated from your baby, such as developing engorgement or mastitis, a very painful condition, if you are unable to feed your baby.The stress of being separated from your baby, along with discomfort and anxiety, may mean it will be hard for you to give optimal evidence.  You can explain that if provision is not made for your situation, it could lead to you feeling ill and this is unfair to both you and the family concerned.Risks for the baby include the unavailability of breastfeeding to provide nourishment and comfort.  It is often assumed that a baby can just take milk from a bottle, but the action of feeding is very different and many cannot adjust.  A baby should not have to have formula against a mother’s wishes, and it takes time to build up an adequate supply of expressed milk. The baby may feel emotional distress being away from his mother.Being separated will also mean that milk supply will drop down with consequences for the future. It may take time for the mother to increase her supply once more, and lead to distress for her and the baby.Judges’ Procedural Rules can be applied to allow you to be with your babyJudges have procedural rules around settling witnesses who have breastfed and special accommodations can be made to keep you and your baby together. The judge needs to balance the needs of the mother and baby against the interests of justice, which require hearing from the witness.Babies in arms can be admitted into court rooms and can even be held and fed by a mother whilst she is giving evidence. Although this is up to the individual judge, they are required to be fair and they have other judges overseeing them to whom complaints can be made if necessary.A public document calledThe Equal Treatment Bench Book explains how a judge should approach this.iIt states that “consideration should always be given to accommodating pregnant and new and breastfeeding mothers in any proceedings, whether they are parties, witnesses or representatives”.“This may include sensitive listings, start and finish times and breaks during the proceedings, sometimes resulting in a case going part-heard”.“A woman who is heavily pregnant or who has just given birth should not be expected to attend a court or tribunal unless she feels able to do so. […] this is likely to apply to at least the month before birth and at least two months after the birth. The period would be longer if there were complications at birth.  Even a telephone hearing may be too difficult if the mother is looking after the baby on her own. This may mean that a hearing has to be adjourned”.“Breaks should be allowed for breastfeeding, having checked with the mother as to the best timing”.“It may be possible to conduct a hearing with a baby or child in the court provided the baby or child is not disrupting the hearing e.g. by crying or making a noise.  However, a hearing should not be conducted in the presence of a child unless the judge is satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances for the child to see and hear the proceedings”.Mothers’ experiences1. “I was really upset to be called at short notice as a witness. I explained I had a breastfed baby I could not leave. I was told I could have a consultation room for my mum and baby to stay in and she had the number for the social worker who was in court who could tell me when a break was needed for me to go and attend to baby. They also said I could take any other breaks I wanted and that I would need to be there for two hours and would be questioned for 75 minutes. In the event my written evidence proved enough, and I didn’t need to appear on the stand.”2. “I was called as a witness in a criminal case and my mother was allowed to go with me and my baby. We were there for two days, but in the end I wasn’t called to give evidence.  I felt reassured knowing my mother was there with my baby.”3. “I had been able to video my testimony but still had to attend for cross questioning.  However this was really brief and my baby didn’t need to nurse while I was in court.”4. “I worked in a role where I had to stand as an expert witness in court. It was emphasised that when we took on clients if that family were to go to court at any point in the coming years we would be obliged to attend, regardless of circumstances.  I left my baby with a relative the one time I had to go to court and it was hugely nerve-wracking.”SummaryWhile you most likely cannot avoid going to court if summonsed as a witness, there are procedures in place to protect you and your baby’s breastfeeding relationship. Not everyone may be aware of this, so do ask about them and explain why they are important.Written by Anna Burbidge with input from Johanna Rhys-Davies, March 2020iThe Equal Treatment Bench Book.

"This page is about young babies who have never breastfed or who get very upset when offered the breast. If your baby was breastfeeding well but is now refusing, see our page on “nursing strikes”. Sometimes, a new difficulty with feeding is the first sign that the baby is becoming unwell. If you are not sure that your baby is well, please contact your doctor.When a baby doesn’t breastfeed after birth, it can be upsetting, confusing and frustrating. You might wonder whether you’re doing something wrong, or even whether your baby likes you. It’s hard not to take it personally!Babies are ‘hardwired’ to breastfeed – it is an essential survival behaviour. When a baby doesn’t breastfeed, it’s never because they don’t want to. Something is making it hard for them. Babies are never “lazy” or “difficult” – they always do the best they can. So do their mothers!When it’s taking time for breastfeeding to get going:Keep your milk flowingKeep your baby fedKeep your baby closeIf you do this, your baby is very likely to breastfeed when they are ready. Time, patience, and good feeding support are usually all you need.This useful summary of the “3 Keeps” can be downloaded as a free A4 posterhere.You can read more about getting breastfeeding on track after a difficult starthere.Why isn’t my baby breastfeeding?After a straightforward birth, most well, full-term babies will start feeding within an hour or so. Not all babies have such an easy start, though. Babies can take longer to start breastfeeding if:They had amore complicated birth. Babies born with the aid of forceps, for example, often take a few days to recover and feed well.  If you had pain medication in labour, your baby may be sleepy and uncoordinated at first.Your baby wasborn early, or smallfor their gestational age. See alsobreastfeeding premature babiesandlate preterm babies(those born between 34 and 37 weeks). Even being born one or two weeks early can mean that your baby takes longer to start breastfeeding. It might take until around your baby’s due date, or a little longer, before they are ready to feed well.You and your baby wereseparatedafter birth because one or both of you needed medical care.Your baby is verysleepyand doesn’t yet have enough energy to breastfeed. See alsosleepy babyandnewborn jaundice.Your baby isunwell.Your baby isuncomfortable, e.g., some babies have a sore head or sore shoulder after birth.Your baby haslow muscle tone(hypotonia).Your baby has a physical challenge such astongue-tie.You have plenty of timeParents sometimes worry that if their baby isn’t breastfeeding well, or at all, in the first few hours, days or weeks after birth, it will never happen.  While breastfeeding in the first hour after birth is ideal, the window of opportunity for babies to start breastfeeding is much longer than this.  The feeding reflexes, which keep babies seeking and attaching to the breast, last for at least two to three months after birth.  We have seen many babies start breastfeeding older than three months, too! There are even reports of children over a year old starting to breastfeed, when placed for adoption with a lactating mother. Where there is milk, there is always the possibility of breastfeeding.Photo: Jen ValslerFirst things firstSorting out breastfeeding problems can feel overwhelming.  There seems to be so much to do, and you might feel you have to do it all at the same time!  It is helpful to know what is urgent and what can wait.  This can help you to work out what to do in what order, and how best to use your time and energy. Feeding at the breast is the least urgent thing, at this stage.If your goal is to have a full milk supply (enough milk to meet all your baby’s needs) but you need to use donated breastmilk or formula at the moment, or if your baby is not growing well just on your milk, then making more milk is the top priority. This is more urgent than your baby starting to feed at the breast.If your baby is not breastfeeding at all yet, or is not breastfeeding effectively, you canexpress your milk. This gives you milk to feed your baby now and encourages your breasts to make plenty of milk for the weeks and months to come.Your breasts may temporarily become swollen and uncomfortable, starting around 2-4 days after birth. This is called “engorgement” and is a sign that your breasts are becoming more active (though not all mothers feel it). It is important to treat engorgement, to keep your breasts comfortable and your milk flowing well. Read more here:Engorged breasts – avoiding and treating.Read here abouthow milk production worksand how toincrease your milk supply.You can find information here on how to usebottles and other feeding tools.Exclusive ExpressingExpressing all the milk your baby needs is known as “exclusive pumping” or “EP”. You can read morehere. Some mothers choose to do this; many do it because their babies are not able to breastfeed. You might find it helpful to join an online support group for “EP mums”.If you need to express your milk for a baby who is not breastfeeding yet, it is important to work with a skilled breastfeeding supporter. You might also want to connect with other mothers who have needed to express milk – they can be your best cheerleaders while you do this important job! Yourlocal La Leche League groupwould love to support you.Setting the scene for breastfeeding – happy time at (or near) the breastMost babies need only time, patience, and gentle encouragement to help them start breastfeeding. Babies are born expecting to breastfeed, with a set of reflexes to help them do it. We need to keep them well fed (with expressed or formula milk), give them lots of relaxed time near the breast, and…. give the baby time.Here are some ideas to try:Hold your baby skin-to-skin. Babies use their whole bodies to feed. The more of their skin they feel against yours, the more likely they are to find the breast and start feeding. Undress your baby down to their nappy and move your clothes out of the way. If you are cold, you can put a blanket round both of you. Even if your baby doesn’t breastfeed yet, it feels lovely, and helps your baby get used to being at or near the breast. Holding your baby against your skin helps you make more milk, too! If your baby can’t tolerate being held in a feeding position, try holding them against your shoulder.Avoid holding your baby in a feeding position during medical procedures, especially if your baby will be having lots. Offer the breast afterwards instead, if it calms them.Try“laid-back” breastfeeding. Try putting your baby tummy-down, on the slope of your body as you recline comfortably (as if you are lying on a sun lounger). Placed like this, they can use their arms and legs to help themselves find the breast and attach well for feeding. This can work better than trying to “put” the baby to the breast, especially if they have already had difficult experiences of this.This videoshows you how. The safest place to do this is in a bed that has been set up following safe sleep guidance. See our article onsafer sleep.Turn up the smell!Newborn babies don’t recognise the breast well by sight, though they do recognise your face, and love looking at it. They find the breast mostly by feel and smell. The little bumps around your nipple (Montgomery’s glands) make a scented oil which helps your baby find the breast and encourages them to feed. You can give your baby extra help by expressing a bit of milk and rubbing it on and around your nipples. This can encourage your baby to feed by increasing the smell and giving them something to lick as they approach the breast!Try“drip-drop feeding”. Your partner or supporter uses a cup and spoon to drip milk (expressed milk or formula) onto the breast as you hold your baby. This can encourage babies to attach and feed. You can watch a videohere.Take a bath with your baby.When placed skin-to-skin with their mother in a warm bath, some babies find the breast and feed for the first time. Some mothers even describe it as “a second chance at giving birth”. You could set the scene with low lighting, a candle or soft music. Whether or not your baby is ready to breastfeed yet, sharing a bath can help you and your baby relax together and enjoy each other. Have another adult with you to help you get in and out safely, put the baby on you and wrap them in a warm towel when they are ready to get out.“Wear”your baby.Babies who are kept close in a sling or soft carrier cry less, are calmer and warmer than babies who are put down by themselves. Being carried is good for babies’ physical & emotional development and helps parents and babies make strong connections. If your baby is not breastfeeding yet, carrying them close, as much as you want, is an excellent way to help them feel comfortable near the breast. Always follow the instructions for your sling or carrier and therules for safe babywearing. You can read more about babywearing inthis book.Feed your baby at or near the breast. If your baby will go to the breast at all, consider using anursing supplementerso your baby can have extra milk while they breastfeed. This can be helpful when milk supply is low and/or your baby is frustrated by the speed of milk flow at the breast. If your baby is fed by cup or bottle, try feeding them skin-to-skin with their cheek against your breast. Let your baby end the feed by sleeping with their cheek pillowed on the breast.Consider sleeping with your baby. Some babies will attach and feed in their sleep if the breast is near enough to smell and feel.  Always considersleep safetybefore sleeping with your baby in your bed.   It is never safe to sleep with a baby on a sofa. You can read more about sleep safety and normal baby sleep in LLL’s bookSweet Sleep.Babies with low muscle tone (hypotonia)A baby who has been diagnosed with a condition that makes them hypotonic, or ‘floppy’, may show little interest in breastfeeding. To make feeding easier:Support your breast. Tuck a rolled-up cloth under your breast close to your chest wall, or support your breast with your thumb on one side of the areola, fingers on the other side.Support your baby’s chin. If your thumb is parallel to your baby’s upper lip, you can use your index finger to put gentle pressure just behind the bony part of the chin while your baby feeds.Try upright positions. A hypotonic baby often feeds better held with their head higher than their bottom.Breast compressioncan also be helpful, but you may also need to give some expressed milk until your baby’s muscle tone improves. Breast compressions are explained in more detail in “My baby needs more milk”.If your baby suddenly becomes floppy and you don’t know why, seek medical advice.Baby stepsWhen you are keen to breastfeed, but your baby isn’t yet ready, it can be frustrating. Don’t forget to celebrate how far you have already come! Every time your baby enjoys being held close to your body, or falls asleep near your breast, they are taking another “baby step” towards breastfeeding. Your baby is doing the best they can for now, and so are you.When breastfeeding is stressfulWhen breastfeeding is difficult for your baby, it may become stressful for both of you. Babies who have had unhappy experiences at the breast can develop negative associations with breastfeeding. This might happen, for example, when:A baby is in pain or discomfort e.g. from birth injury or allergy.A sensitive baby is handled at the breast in a way they don’t like, e.g., if a helper tries hard to “put” the baby to the breast when they aren’t ready.Milk supply is low.A baby has a physical restriction (e.g., tongue tie) that makes attaching and sucking difficult.A baby who is finding feeding difficult may become upset:A short time into the feed, when milk flow slows down.At the start of the feed, when milk doesn’t come straight away.When offered the breast.When put in a breastfeeding position.When they see the breast.When feeding isn’t going well, babies may come to associate the breast with hunger and frustration. They may develop apreference for another feeding method, such as a bottle, if they associate it with feeling full and satisfied. You can find some ideas on how to keep your baby’s relationship with the breast positive here:using donor milk & formula milk to support breastfeedingThe ideas in the previous section (“Setting the scene for breastfeeding – happy time at (or near) the breast”) can help your baby learn that the breast is a lovely place to be, and to associate it with calm, relaxation, comfort, and satisfaction rather than hunger and frustration.Take a breakIf breastfeeding has become very stressful for you and your baby, you might need a “breastfeeding break”.  You could stop trying for a few days, whilst expressing your milk to keep your baby fed and keep your milk flowing.  When you’re both ready, you can try again. There is no rush! Dr Christina Smillie, an American doctor who specialises in breastfeeding medicine, calls this “rebooting the baby”.What if my baby is still not breastfeeding?When you are eager to breastfeed, it is hard to wait. It is not uncommon for babies to need time to begin breastfeeding well. You might be encouraged by hearing the stories of other parents whose babies took time to get going.If your baby is still not breastfeeding even with time, patience and some of the tips in this article, there will be a reason why. A skilled breastfeeding supporter can help you find out, and work towards breastfeeding. Some babies need medical care, some benefit from feeding tools such asnipple shieldsand a few need treatment fortongue tie. Many just need a little more time.A few babies never do breastfeed. Some have a medical condition that makes it impossible. Very rarely, we never find out why. You don’t have to feed your baby directly from the breast to give them the many benefits of your milk or to nurture them at your breast. We can support you to have a close, happy feeding relationship with your baby, whatever form that takes.La Leche League Leaders (breastfeeding counsellors) can help.

"If your new baby has jaundice, it’s normal to be worried and concerned. Knowing more about newborn jaundice will help you decide if you need to see medical help and understand why tests may be needed.More than 80% of all newborns appear jaundiced during the first week of life. In most cases, this is a normal part of adjusting to life outside the womb, but occasionally jaundice is a sign of other more serious health problems. Jaundice is also more common in pre-term and premature babies, who need treatment to avoid serious health problems. Sometimes treatment of jaundice presents challenges that new breastfeeding mothers and their babies need to overcome.What causes jaundice?Breastfeeding and jaundiceWhen to be concernedDifferent types of jaundiceIs jaundice normal?Treating newborn jaundiceSleepy babyBreastfeed frequentlyEnough breastmilk?What causes jaundice?Most babies are born with more red blood cells than they need for life outside the womb. When these cells break down after birth, they produce a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which circulates in the blood. When bilirubin reaches the liver, it is changed into a form that can be transported to the intestines and passed out of the body in the baby’s poo. However, a newborn baby’s liver cannot process all the bilirubin at once. Excess bilirubin is deposited in the skin, muscles, and mucous membranes of the body, which look yellowish or a golden colour. This may be harder to notice on darker skin.Breastfeeding and jaundiceJaundice seems to occur more often and last longer in breastfed babies. It’s more serious in those who don’t breastfeed frequently in the first days of life. Newborns who nurse every hour or two have frequent poos, and this clears bilirubin from the intestines more efficiently. However some healthy breastfed babies may still show signs of jaundice at two or three weeks of age.When to be concerned?Seek medical help if your baby:appears jaundiced within 48 hours of birth;appears jaundiced beyond the third week;appears jaundiced and is premature or sick;shows yellowing of the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet;has black, brown or green poo after day 5shows signs of dehydration with fewer than five wet nappies per dayWhen a baby appears jaundiced, regular blood tests may be requested to monitor bilirubin levels.Continue breastfeedingFrequent breastfeeding during the first days of life will help clear bilirubin from your baby’s body.Babies who are breastfeeding well are less likely to be jaundiced. If your baby is jaundiced, continue to breastfeed and make sure they are getting enough milk. See our informationhereand seek help if you are unsure.Don’t give waterBilirubin is eliminated in a baby’s poo and a baby who is frequently breastfed will have plenty of bowel movements. Giving water or other breastmilk substitutes makes things worse as baby will nurse less often.Different types of jaundiceSuboptimal intake jaundiceOccurs within the first week in association with ongoing weight lossshould resolve within two weeksBreastmilk jaundiceJaundice which persists past 2-3 weeks along with healthy weight gain.May last up to three monthsTreatment is not generally requiredIs jaundice normal?When bilirubin levels rise slowly over the first three or four days, a baby probably has normal physiological jaundice. This is harmless and some experts think it may even be beneficial.When blood bilirubin levels are too high, bilirubin may enter the brain and damage the nervous system. High bilirubin levels and jaundice may be related to other health problems. Blood tests can identify these early, so the underlying problem can be treated.Treating Newborn JaundiceBlood TestsIf your baby finds blood tests distressing, it helps to breastfeed immediately after the test.PhototherapySometimes phototherapy is needed to treat newborn jaundice. Phototherapy uses special blue-green lights to break down the bilirubin stored in a baby’s skin so that it can be eliminated more easily. A baby lies under the ‘bili-lights’ wearing just a nappy, with their eyes covered to protect them. They stay under the lights continuously for a day or two, although you may remove them from the lights for feeds. Once the bilirubin levels begin to fall, the lights are no longer needed.Phototherapy restricts the time you can spend holding and nursing your baby. So if phototherapy is needed, try to do everything you can to stay close to them and continue to breastfeed as frequently as possible. This can be a stressful time for you –contact an LLL Leaderif you want support or to talk things through.Keep baby close during phototherapy:If you are still in the hospital, the phototherapy unit can usually be set up at the bedside, so that you can talk to your baby, touch them, and breastfeed frequently.In some cases, babies can receive phototherapy using a fibre-optic blanket that wraps around the baby’s body and provides continuous light treatment. Your baby’s eyes will not have to be covered, and you can hold and breastfeed them during treatment.Questions to ask about treatment optionsHow necessary is it to treat the jaundice at this stage?Could we continue to monitor our baby’s bilirubin levels, encourage him to breastfeed more frequently, and re-evaluate the situation in 24 hours?If phototherapy is needed, how can we ensure frequent breastfeeding?Sleepy BabyHigh bilirubin levels can make your baby sleepy and lethargic and less interested in breastfeeding. Encourage your sleepy baby to nurse well using the suggestions fromSleepy Baby—why and what to do.Breastfeed frequentlyFrequent breastfeeds help clear bilirubin from baby’s intestines more quickly. A baby who feeds well and often is less likely to have a problem with jaundice.Respond to your baby’s early feeding cues and encourage your baby to breastfeed at least 10–12 times in 24 hours.Help them to attach deeply and comfortably at the breast and nurse well. ‘Laid back breastfeeding’ positions where your baby is snuggled in full body contact against you for periods of time can encourage frequent,comfortable breastfeeding. Seek skilled help straight away if you are finding breastfeeding difficult or painful.If your baby is not breastfeeding effectively, express your milk every couple of hours to help establish milk production and reduce breast engorgement. Give small amounts of your expressed milk to your baby by cup or syringe. Once your baby has the food they need, they will have more energy to breastfeed.Enough breastmilk?What comes out is a sign of what has gone in, so counting dirty nappies can be a useful guide between weighing sessions.AgeDirty Nappies per 24 hours1-2 daysGreenish-black tarry meconium3-5 daysAt least 3 greenish transitional poos5+ daysAt least 3-5 yellow, loose unformed poos the size of a 2p coin or largerIf your baby is not getting enough milk, refer to our articleIs my baby getting enough milk?orMy baby needs more milkor seek support from an LLL leader to increase your milk production. Sometimes supplementing may be necessary while continuing to breastfeed.Seek supportIf you are feeling overwhelmed, an LLL Leader can provide a listening ear. She can also offer ideas to help you improve your baby’s attachment and suggest ways to encourage your baby to breastfeed better to help clear the jaundice.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of La Leche League GB.  Photo courtesy of Justine Fieth and Lena KnowlesFurther ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

"How do you tell if your baby is getting enough milk? In a world where everything is measured, it can be nerve-wracking when you can’t see how much milk your breasts are making.Follow your baby not the bookWeight gainDirty nappiesHow frequently are you breastfeeding?Sleepy baby?Breastfeeding solutionsBreast compressionsSimple ideas for boosting milk productionFollow your baby not the bookSome parenting books recommendroutinesfor breastfed babies. Butroutines can reduce breastmilk production, as can unnecessary supplements or adummy. Whatever their weight, a young baby needs to nurse at least 2–3 hourly to establish their mother’s milk supply and get enough milk.Frequent nursing is normal, partly because breastmilk is a drink as well as a food. Adults rarely go longer than a couple of hours without a drink, snack or meal. Your baby’s tummy is tiny and breastmilk is quickly digested so they need frequent feeds to help them grow.Weight gainNewborns often lose up to 7% of their birth weight in the first few days. Once your milk production increases, usually on day 3–4, expect your baby to begin regaining their lost weight.  Most babies regain their birth weight by 10–14 days old.  Your baby will grow at their own rate, and a growth chart will indicate how they are doing (seeFurther Reading). Once breastfeeding is going well and there are no concerns, weighing is advisable no more than once a month in the first six months. If there are concerns, monitor the trend of his weight change over several weeks rather than focusing on one particular week.Your baby’s weight may increase steadily and so follow a single percentile line on the chart, or rise faster, crossing the percentile lines. A gradual drop from one percentile line to the next (or the equivalent distance) is unlikely to be a problem unless your baby’s weight is low for their age. Heavier newborns often show ‘catch-down’ growth—meaning they gain weight steadily even though they gradually drop against the percentile lines. Dropping against the chart is more of a worry for lower weight babies. Seek help quickly if your baby isn’t gaining weight well.See our pageMy Baby Needs More Milk, or contact anLLL Leaderfor further information.Look at your babyYou may instinctively know how your baby is doing.  Ask yourself: Do they look healthy and seem active and alert? Are they meeting developmental milestones? Do they usually seem content and satisfied after breastfeeds.Dirty nappiesDirty nappies are a good indicator of how much milk your baby has taken. The table below shows what is normal.AgeDirty nappies per 24 hours1-2 daysgreenish-black tarry meconium3-5 daysat least 3 greenish transitional poos5+ daysat least 3-5 yellow, unformed poos, the size of a 2p coin or larger6 weeks +possibly less frequent but larger poosHow frequently are you breastfeeding?The more often you breastfeed, the more milk you will produce. You will make less milk if you breastfeed less often.In the early weeks, a baby needs to nurse about every 2–3 hours, or at least 8–12 times in a 24-hour period, including some feeds at night.Allow your baby to breastfeed for as long and as often as they seem interested. To help them get a balanced meal let them finish feeding from the first breast before offering the second.Sleepy baby?A baby who sleeps a lot rather than feeding every 2–3 hours may need to be wakened to nurse, and this is particularly important if they havejaundiceor they aren’t gaining enough weight. If this is difficult, or they are lethargic, ask your midwife, health visitor or GP to check that all is well. Our pageSleepy Baby  – why and what to doexplains more.For most breastfeeding problems there is a breastfeeding solution.  Almost all mothers can produce enough milk to meet their baby’s needs.Check your baby is latched on well.Make sure they have full body contact with you. Ensure they have a large mouthful of breast and listen and watch for swallowing as they feed. See our article which has lots of information about how to help your baby withpositioning and attachment.Breastfeed often, offering both breasts– at least 8-12 times in 24 hours. Wake your baby if necessary. Watch for rooting (head turning) or fist sucking – crying is a late sign of hunger.Encourage ‘cluster nursing’– breastfeed very often at times when your baby is willing to.Seek skilled help early onif you are finding breastfeeding difficult, uncomfortable or painful. Contact an LLL Leader for help.Keep your baby close– try laid back breastfeeding, reclining comfortably with your baby while lightly dressed or in skin-to-skin contact close to your breasts. They will have lots of opportunity to breastfeed, even in a light sleep, and this boosts levels of the hormones that increase your milk.Encourage breastfeeding for comfortas well as food as this boosts milk production. Stop using anydummy—breastfeed instead.Night feeds are especially importantfor establishing and increasing milk production. See our pageSafe Sleep & The Breastfed Baby.Get help with household jobs—ignore the jobs around the house and and eat simple, easily prepared meals so you can concentrate on resting and breastfeeding your baby.The most effective way to increase your milk production is to take your baby to bed with you for a day or two, and focus solely on nursing and caring for him, whilst other people take care of you.Breast compressionsBreast compressions can encourage a baby to breastfeed actively and take more milk:Support your breast with one hand—thumb on one side, fingers on the other.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, their jaw moving all the way to their ear. When they stop swallowing, compress your breast firmly to increase milk flow. Hold it squeezed while they continue swallowing, then release your hand.Rotate your hand around the breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast. Go gently—this should not hurt.Try switching breasts at least two or three times during each feed—when your baby comes off the first breast on their own or when breast compression no longer keeps them breastfeeding actively. As time goes by you’ll find that you no longer need to do this.Simple ideas for boosting milk productionRemoving small amounts of milk even from soft comfortable breasts increases milk production:Full breasts slow milk production.Babies nurse for comfort as well as for food:those little ‘in between’ comfort feeds really help your milk production.Your baby is fussy:Many babies have a regular fussy time (often evenings) however hungry or not they may be. Some babies need lots of stimulation; others need soothing. You’ll soon learn what your baby needs. If they settle at the breast, just let them nurse.Expect your baby to want to breastfeed very often from time to time:Your breasts will quickly adjust to making more milk if you follow your baby’sneeds.Your baby’s feeds may become shorterperhaps only five minutes at each breast. Most babies become very efficient at breastfeeding once nursing is going well.Babies’ feeding patterns are very individual: If your baby is gaining weight at an appropriate rate, then following the feeding pattern they choose is the best way to meet their needs. It may be different from other babies.For more information about increasing our milk supply if needed, see our article:How to increase your milk supply.Your milk is always perfect for your baby, even if he is gaining weight slowly. A breastfeeding solution is usually possible if he needs more milk.Contact your local LLL Leader.

"The size and shape of nipples and breasts vary widely between women. These differences have little to do with the ability to breastfeed—though if one or both nipples are flat or inverted some mothers find that establishing breastfeeding takes a little extra time and patience in the early days.Inverted nipples?Many nipples will protrude when stimulated.If you think yours may be inverted, try placing your thumb and finger on opposite sides of the areola (the darker area of skin surrounding the nipple) and squeezing gently inwards. A nipple that stands out when stimulated is not inverted. Sometimes nipples may be partly inverted, looking dimpled or folded. Severely inverted nipples usually retract deeply when compressed or stimulated.It’s common for nipples to change shape during pregnancy, gradually protruding more. After your baby is born, your nipples may appear flatter but babies often lick the nipple to stimulate it before latching on. Your nipples may also appear flatter if your breasts are very full or engorged.CausesTreatmentGood attachment is the keyComfortable breastfeedingIf your baby isn’t nursing wellSoften your breastStimulate your nipplesTry using a breast pumpNipple shieldsPracticalitiesGetting a deep latchSeek supportTreating inverted nipplesWhen further help is neededCausesInverted nipples may be caused by:Tiny bands of connective tissue connecting the nipple to the inner breast tissueShort milk ductsLess dense connective tissue beneath the nipple than in women with protruding nipplesTreatmentThere is no agreement about whether it is helpful to treat inverted nipples. The Royal College of Midwives believes that a diagnosis of flat or inverted nipples serves only to damage a mother’s confidence in her ability to breastfeed. While individual mothers sometimes find one of the treatments suggested overleaf for inverted nipples helpful, no controlled studies have shown any particular treatment to be effective. Whether or not you try the techniques below, do learn how to hand express milk. You may also like to try expressing your colostrum in the last four weeks of pregnancy. Any colostrum you collect can be frozen and given to your baby after the birth if needed.Antenatal Expression of Colostrumprovides more information.Good attachment is the keyWhatever breastfeeding specialists think about the different treatment options, they all agree that getting a deep latch is crucial. Babies breastfeed—not nipplefeed—so with effective positioning and attachment your baby can learn to nurse well even if you have flat or inverted nipples. When a baby takes in a large enough mouthful of breast he will be able to feed effectively, so the shape of your nipples may not be an issue at all. ReadingLa Leche League booksand leaflets before your baby is born will help you learn about breastfeeding and how to avoid common difficulties. Try to attend anLLL Meetingtoo—pregnant women are always welcome.Comfortable breastfeedingComfortable positioning and attachmentare important for all mothers. You will have time to practice with your baby while your breasts are soft before your milk comes in. Whether or not you have flattish nipples, start as soon as possible by holding your baby in skin-to-skin contact right after the birth. The earlier you start, the easier it is. laid-back or ‘natural’ positions can be a great help in encouraging your baby to latch on well, as well as being comfortable for you.If your baby isn’t nursing wellHand express or pumpto stimulate your breasts to make milk. Aim to express as often as your baby would be feeding, about 8–12 times in 24 hours. Your expressed milk can be offered by spoon, cup or syringe while you both learn how to breastfeed. Avoid using bottles or dummies as they may cause nipple confusion, making matters worse.Soften your breastBreastfeed as often as you can. When your baby bobs his head and licks the nipple, he naturally makes it easier to latch on. If your breast is full and hard, you can use reverse pressure softening to move fluids away from the nipple area so your baby can latch on well. Apply gentle steady pressure with your fingertips on the areola around your nipple for about a minute. You can also press with the sides of your thumbs or fingers. Denting the breast at the edge of the areola with a finger and placing your baby’s chin in the dent may also help. Gently hand express a little milk if needed.Stimulate your nipplesIf your baby’s head bobbing and licking isn’t enough to stimulate your nipples, try:Rolling your nipple gently between your thumb and fingerTouching your nipple with a cold moist clothTry using a breast pumpWith some deeply inverted nipples, when a baby tries to breastfeed, he compresses the buried nipple beneath his mother’s areola. If simpler techniques of stimulating your nipples before a feed fail, an automatic electric pump may be needed to provide suction to draw the nipple out before a feed. Once may be enough, or you may need to pump before each feed for a few days or perhaps weeks.Nipple shieldsAnipple shieldis a thin, silicone teat that can be placed over a mother’s nipple and may help a baby who is having difficulty learning to breastfeed. Nipple shields can be used temporarily to help establish breastfeeding. They come in different sizes—a comfortable fit is very important.It is very important to seek skilled help with positioning, attachment and any other problems if you are already using nipple shields or planning to use them. Whilst a nipple shield can be a useful tool it should be regarded as only a temporary solution—continue to offer your baby some time in skin-to-skin contact every day without a nipple shield so he has the opportunity to latch on if he is able.PracticalitiesFirst breastfeedsBreastfeed early and often after your baby’s birth to minimize engorgement. Many babies have no difficulty feeding from mothers with inverted nipples, so start off by putting him to the breast and see how he gets on. If he latches on well and you are comfortable he will get plenty of practice and will probably continue to feed well after your milk comes in and your breasts feel fuller.If your baby won’t breastfeedDon’t panic! A baby usually starts to suck spontaneously if he can snuggle up close to his mother’s bare chest for periods of time. Try letting your baby lie on your body as you recline so that both his chest and tummy are against you. This kind of contact, sometimes known asBiological Nurturing™, usually stimulates a baby’s instinct to attach and suckle well at the breast. In such positions babies can also latch on when sleepy or in light sleep. Watch for signs your baby is stirring and gently encourage feeding.Practical tipsGetting a deep latchHelp your baby get a deep mouthful of breast using the following tips:Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby. Relax comfortably with your breast in its natural positionKeep your baby’s whole body close against your bodyHelp your baby approach the breast ’nose to nipple’ with his chin on or close to the breast. Keep his body tucked in close as he attaches and feeds but make sure he can tip his head back easily to open his mouth wideAs your breast touches his tongue, it will push his lower jaw open wider. If you are sitting up, as he opens his mouth to take the breast pull his body in firmly against you and give a little push between his shoulder bladesThis will help him open his mouth very wide to get his top lip over the nipple area to latch on, resulting in a bigger and better mouthful of breastHis lower jaw will be tucked into your breast well away from the base of your nipple and his nose will be free. Active sucking is triggered when your breast tissue reaches the back of his mouthOnce your baby is attached you can make small adjustments to maximise your own comfort. If you’re sitting up to feed, try shifting your weight back onto your tail bone and reclining your body back a little to open up a space for your baby. This allows more of his weight to be supported by your body and less by your arms. Gravity can help him stay attached deeply.You can also experiment with different holds to help you find what works best for you. An LLL Leader can help you find the most effective approach. You can find more detailed information by reading our pagePositioning & Attachment.Some women like (or need) to hold their breast when nursing. Theyflatten their breast as they would a big sandwich they were offering to the baby, matching it to the oval of his mouth. This can help their baby grasp more breast tissue. It doesn’t matter if fingers are closer to the upper jaw but try to keep the “lower jaw fingers” out of your baby’s way.Exaggerated latchTo help get an even deeper latch you could try placing your thumb or finger near the base of the nipple where the middle of your baby’s upper lip will be, lined up with his nose. As you press, your nipple will tilt away from your baby, presenting him with your breast rather than your nipple. As he opens wide, snuggle him in close and use your thumb or finger to tuck the breast into his mouth. Your nipple will be taken in last and unroll in his mouth. You can then slip your finger out.Seek SupportMany mothers experience challenges with breastfeeding and findattending LLL meetingssupportive. They will give you the chance to see that, whatever challenges you may face, breastfeeding can become a rewarding experience. If there is noLLL groupin your area, you can stillcontact an LLL Leader for support.Treating inverted nipplesVarious techniques can be used to draw out nipples—though research on their effectiveness is inconclusive. If using devices, it is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions.The Hoffman TechniqueThis technique is used during pregnancy. With a thumb on each side of the base of the  nipple, press in firmly against the breast tissue and at the same time pull your thumbs away  from each other. If this feels comfortable, repeat five times each morning, moving your thumbs around the base of the nipple. If you experience pain this technique may not be appropriate for you.The Nipplette™The Nipplette™ is a device that uses suction to help a nipple protrude. It consists of a transparent nipple mould from which air is sucked using a small syringe. The device is placed over the nipple area for increasing time each day during the first six months of  pregnancy. One device is needed for each inverted nipple. The manufacturers do not recommend use in the last three months of pregnancy. While breastfeeding, limit use to a  few minutes to draw out the nipple immediately before breastfeeding.Breast shellsSometimes, two-piece breast shells are suggested to apply steady pressure to encourage flat or inverted nipples to protrude. Whilst individual mothers report that using breast shells is a help, research has found them to be ineffective. They can be worn during pregnancy or before breastfeeds. If you decide to try breast shells, wear them for no longer than 30 minutes before feeds to reduce the risk of nipple soreness due to lack of air circulating around the nipple and blocked ducts due to pressure. You may need a bra with a larger cup size than normal. Breast shells need to be washed daily and any milk collected should be discarded because of the risk of bacterial growth.Other concernsSore nipplesYou may experience some discomfort in the first couple of weeks of breastfeeding as your baby gradually draws your nipple out. This is temporary and different from nipple damage and soreness caused by a baby who isn’t latching on well. Pat your nipples dry after feeds, replace breast pads frequently and change wet bras. Your aim is for comfortable, relaxed feeds for you and your baby. So seek skilled help if you do experience nipple damage.One breast preferenceDifferences in your nipples can lead to your baby preferring one breast to the other. You can encourage your baby to breastfeed on the least preferred side by putting your baby to the breast when he is in light sleep, offering it first at feeds and by breastfeeding frequently. Some mothers express from the least preferred breast to maintain milk production. However, some babies are quite determined in their preferences and end up breastfeeding from only one side. If this happens, milk production from the preferred breast will increase to meet your baby’s needs as the other breast produces less. Any lop-sidedness will be temporary.When further help is neededIf you have flat or inverted nipples and then experience additional challenges such as a premature birth or a thrush infection, seek help from your midwife orLLL Leader.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone & mothers of LLLGB.  Photos courtesy Lois Rowlands and Kate Riley.Further ReadingAntenatal Expression of ColostrumBeginning BreastfeedingComfortable BreastfeedingEngorged breasts – avoiding and treatingHand Expression of BreastmilkIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?My Baby Won’t BreastfeedNipple ConfusionNipple ShieldsSleepy Baby – why and what to doFrom LLLIInverted nipples don’t stop breastfeedingBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

"When you and your baby have a satisfying breastfeeding relationship, preparing for any separation can leave you with mixed feelings. This is regardless of whether you’ll be away from your baby for just an hour or two, or longer. You may be concerned about whether your baby will take your expressed breastmilk in your absence and whether he will be happy being looked after by someone else.A breastfeeding mother often finds it easier to keep her baby with her when at all possible, rather than making arrangements for separation. A little creative thinking may get around many obstacles. However, for situations when it’s necessary to leave your baby with someone else, these tips from other mothers may help you and your baby.Your baby’s carePractical considerationsMore than one feeding optionHow much milkPracticalitiesReverse cycle nursingSolid foodsAn evening outTime can make a differenceYour baby still needs youYour baby’s careYour baby may be distressed by being separated from you and that is normal. Being left with a stranger, however kind and caring that person may be, can be frightening for a young  child. So try to find a carer your baby already knows and loves, eg his other parent, carer or grandparent. If this isn’t possible, choosing someone who has looked after breastfed babies before and who will respect your own mothering style is going to be best for you both. Allow as much time as possible for your baby to get to know his caregiver gradually in your presence before leaving him. Talk with whoever is to look after him about your baby’s needs and your expectations for his care, and explain that you will be leaving your own milk for him.If you are returning to work, choosing childcare near your workplace can often reduce the time you are away from your baby. It may allow you to go to breastfeed him during your lunch hour, or your baby to be brought to you. However, what’s most important is to have a caregiver you and your baby are comfortable with, even if they are further from your workplace.If your baby will be in a group setting, ask who will be your child’s key worker so you can speak directly with them. When returning to work, arrange to leave your child with his carer for short introductory periods of time before leaving him for a whole day.Practical considerationsExplain about your baby’s preferences and how you would like him cared for. Consider:Feeding patterns. Explain how his milk feeds should be offered, how often and how to recognise your baby is hungry.Reminding the carer to offer only your milk unless you’ve given permission for your baby to have other foods and drinks.Storage and preparation of your milk.If your baby is over 6 months, what foods and drinks he is used to and whether he prefers to feed himself.Your child’s favourite toys and activities.His individual character and how he approaches new situations.Nap patterns and how he prefers to be settled to sleep.It’s a good idea to discuss what to do if your baby refuses to feed or is upset. A good carer will have his or her own suggestions too. Lots of physical contact and attention will help your baby while you’re away. Familiar toys and feeding utensils can also help a baby feel comfortable.Source: United States Breastfeeding CommitteeMore than one feeding optionMany breastfed babies never have bottles even in situations when mothers and babies are apart. Your baby can be offered your milk in several ways—you can opt for whichever he prefers. Detailed information on the feeding options outlined below—including ideas for when a baby is reluctant to take a bottle—are given on our pageWhen Mum Can’t Be There.Babiesunder three months: very young babies can be fed breastmilk from a small feeding cup, a spoon, or a feeding syringe.Fromthree months: using either an open cup or a baby beaker with a simple spout (no valves) is an option for a baby from three months of age. A baby will often take drinks from these when his mother is present, which can reassure you that your baby will take milk while you are away. You can give your baby the chance to experiment with a spouted or open cup that he can hold himself.Once your baby issix months old, you can offer water or occasionally very diluted juice in a cup to encourage him to drink. Sit at a table with him and have a drink yourself, so he can copy you. You could pretend to drink from his beaker, and emphasise the pleasure of drinking. The social interaction can be very important, compensating for the closeness of breastfeeding to help your baby accept the alternatives more readily.Bottles: there are disadvantages to using bottles to feed very young breastfed babies. They may develop ‘nipple confusion’, as sucking at the breast requires a different technique from sucking at a bottle. Once breastfeeding is well established this is less likely to be a problem, though many babies resist or refuse to take a bottle. The longer you can wait to leave your baby, the easier it is to avoid bottles altogether.How much milk?It’s very difficult to determine how much a breastfed baby will drink when separated from his mother. Much will depend on his age, how well fed he is beforehand and for how long he is left. There’s evidence that fully breastfed babies require less milk than formula fed babies— as much as 25% fewer calories at four months. No one can predict how much milk an individual baby will want at a particular feed, although a regular caregiver will soon get a good idea of how much a baby usually takes. On average, breastfed babies take between 60–120 ml (2–4 oz) about 8 to 10 times per day. It’s unlikely that a breastfed baby would consume 240 ml (8 oz) of breastmilk at one feed.PracticalitiesPlan to nurse your baby just before you leave and immediately upon your return. That way you needn’t worry if he only takes small amounts whilst you are gone. It will also reduce the number of times you need to express whilst away and help you avoid engorgement or mastitis. If you are not able to breastfeed at the caregiver’s prior to leaving your baby, nursing just before you leave home is an alternative. Some mothers nurse in the car outside their caregiver’s.Reverse cycle nursingMany babies adapt to their mother’s working hours, taking very little milk from their caregiver and then nursing very frequently when mother is around. This frequent nursing helps make up for a mother’s absence and also helps maintain milk production. The less you are apart the easier it will be for your baby to compensate for missed feeds. You may also find sleeping close to your baby helps you cope more easily with night waking.Taking time to concentrate on your baby’s needs is the greatest help in maintaining your relationship, whatever a baby’s reaction to separation. If your baby appears to reject you it is even more important that you give him as much of your time and attention as possible. It isn’t really a rejection of you, but a normal reaction to the stress of separation. You may find that he becomes very clingy, and doesn’t want you to leave or put him down. Encouraging better attachment to his caregiver—perhaps by spending time together with your baby and his caregiver— may help him feel more secure when you are away. Some mothers find it helpful to reduce their working hours temporarily.Solid foodsBreastfed babies are often very good at moderating their own intake of foods and fluid, and not taking more then they need. A healthy baby is more likely to take whatever food and drink is available, than go hungry or thirsty. If your baby is taking solid foods, these will compensate if he refuses to take much expressed breastmilk. Many foods contain water, especially fruits. It’s also possible to offer expressed milk mixed with some solid foods. Some babies prefer to take a drink with solids, so offering a drink with a snack may be a good option. If your baby has solids, it’s important to let your carer know what he’s used to. If you aren’t providing food yourself, share information on what he can eat and whether to serve it as finger food, mashed or pureed. If your baby feeds himself, tell your caregiver, as many people expect to spoonfeed babies.An evening outIf you’re planning to leave your baby for an evening out, you may have more options than you think. Some mothers choose to meet with friends during the day. There may be a time of day when your baby is more content for you to be away. Others arrange a suitable  get together so they can take their babies along too.Although drinking substantial amounts of alcohol regularly can have an impact on your milk supply and can lead to poor weight gain and motor development in your baby, research shows that an occasional beer or a glass of wine is not harmful for nursing babies. As alcohol inhibits oxytocin release, thus reducing milk letdown, nursing right after a couple of drinks can temporarily decrease the baby’s milk intake, although studies show that the baby will make up for it by nursing more often once maternal alcohol levels are back to normal. If you are planning to drink while you’re out, you may want to breastfeed your baby before your do so and then wait until your body has metabolised the alcohol (approximately 1 ounce in 3 hours) before nursing again. The less alcohol you drink, the shorter it will take for it be gone from your milk. Alternatively, you may want to consider having a non-alcoholic drink. You can  read more about alcohol and breastfeedinghere.If you drink heavily and need to express for comfort during or after, discard this milk. Consider whether the alcohol you drink will make you less responsive to your baby and less able to care for him. Remember that younger babies are more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and thatbedsharing is unsafe if anyone in the bed has drunk alcohol.Time can make a differenceA few weeks can make a lot of difference in the life of a baby, especially to your baby’s coordination, ability to sit up, and readiness for solid foods and other ways of taking drinks. If you’ve been trying unsuccessfully to introduce a bottle prior to a necessary separation, why not take a break? Try to relax and trust your plans will go well. If you feel stressed and preoccupied with the coming separation, your baby may react to this. There are always other feeding options that can ensure your baby’s needs are met. Some mothers have found that exploring ways of delaying or avoiding separation from their babies has been possible and best for them both.Your baby still needs youBeing able to breastfeed frequently when you are back together will help him adjust to the times when you are unavailable. Breastfeeding is so much more than just food; it’s an opportunity for your baby to feel safe and secure. And it will also help protect him from any illnesses with which he comes into contact while you are apart. He really is a very lucky baby to have a mother who cares so much about his needs. By continuing to breastfeed you are giving him a sense of normality and the opportunity to be close to the most important person in his life just now: YOU.Written by Karen Butler and mothers of La Leche League Great Britain.

"Sucking is a basic instinct that babies are born with. Babies suck for both food and comfort. Breastmilk also provides protection against disease so nature has made sure that babies love to be at the breast. They are comforted by the warmth, smell, delicious milk and reassuring sound of your heartbeat.Breastfeeding offers a lot of security too, whether your baby is feeling lonely, frightened, sad, cross, or ill at ease with a new situation.In the early days, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by your baby’s need to nurse. But meeting his needs makes him feel safe and ensures you have plenty of milk. As he grows, your baby’s nursing pattern will change and life with your new baby should settle down.Whenever a substitute for sucking at the breast is used there is a risk of affecting the breastfeeding relationship, especially for a baby who has not yet mastered nursing at the breast.Milk productionBreastfeeding problemsEarly weaningWhy give a dummyInfectionsDental problemsProblems for motherIf breastfeeding is affectedWeaning from a dummyBreastfeeding, Dummies and SIDSMilk productionDummy use may reduce your milk production and result in poor weight gain. In the early weeks it’s really important to nurse often and ensure all sucking is at the breast to establish and maintain good milk production.Breastfeeding problemsUsing a dummy can make it harder for your baby to breastfeed comfortably and effectively (1). The shape and firmer feel of a dummy differs from your pliable breast. Some babies may prefer the stronger sucking trigger of a dummy, leading to ‘confusion’ about how to nurse at the softer breast. The result may be sore nipples for you and not enough milk for your baby. He may become frustrated and start to fuss, cry or refuse to breastfeed altogether.Early weaningRegular dummy use is associated with premature weaning (1,2).  A dummy is often assumed to be an essential parenting tool. A baby is comforted by sucking, so what could be more convenient than a small portable device to pop in his mouth? But will offering a dummy cause problems with breastfeeding or can you combine the two?Babies like to suck for pure pleasure even when milk flow slows. You have only to look at your older baby to see this—he frequently looks up into your eyes then breaks off sucking to give you a great big smile. You in turn smile and talk to your baby. These are the first steps in your baby’s development of language and relationships.Why give a dummy?It’s important to remember that a dummy is a substitute for the breast—an object to silence, or pacify a baby’s crying until the real thing is available. For this reason it doesn’t really make sense for people to suggest a baby is using his mother as a ‘human dummy’ when he wants to nurse for comfort.There may be occasions when it’s convenient to use a dummy—to calm your baby briefly when you can’t nurse him immediately, for example if you’re driving. Sometimes a baby with colic will find it soothing to suck on a dummy between feeds.If you decide to give your baby a dummy, it’s better to wait until breastfeeding is well-established and he is gaining weight well. You will also need to follow manufacturer’s guidelines on cleaning and replacement.In some hospitals premature babies may be given a dummy during tube feeding to stimulate their sucking reflex, help digestion and help them associate the action of sucking with receiving food. It’s best if this is just a temporary substitute and efforts are made to establish breastfeeding as soon as possible.InfectionsYour baby has an increased risk of ear infections if he regularly has a dummy (3).Thrushcan be a problem too, as it thrives on moist surfaces at room temperature.Dental problemsBreastfeeding provides exercise for optimum development of a baby’s mouth, tongue and jaws and many orthodontists say they see fewer dental problems in breastfed babies. Regular dummy use can affect the growth of teeth and the shape of babies’ mouths, increasing the risk of sleep apnoea* and the need for braces later on (4,5). It can also increase the levels of decay-causing bacteria in babies’ mouths (4).Problems for mothersYou can be at risk of engorgement and mastitis when you introduce a dummy—a particular problem if you have an oversupply of milk. Your periods and fertility may also return earlier as your hormone levels are affected when your baby nurses less.Don’t forgetMany babies have no interest in using a dummy. You are the best pacifier in the world from your baby’s point of view. And what could be more natural than to bring peace to your baby with the warmth of your presence through breastfeeding, rather than with a plastic device.If breastfeeding is affectedStop using the dummy so that your baby can concentrate on learning to feed well at the breast.Offer a breastfeed while he is still calm and pay extra attention to how he is positioned and attached at the breast.Encourage your baby to breastfeed at least 8–12 times in 24 hours, offering both sides and allowing him to nurse for comfort.To encourage his interest in breastfeeding hand express so milk is flowing before offering the breast.Ask yourLLL Leaderabout the technique of breast compression which has been found to encourage babies to continue breastfeeding actively for longer.Spend extra time cuddling, carrying and holding your baby, including skin-to-skin contact to help him relax and encourage his interest in breastfeeding.Weaning from a dummyRegardless of whether it affects  breastfeeding, you and your baby can become over-attached to a dummy. It is easy to find yourself using it more and more and your toddler’s language and social development may be delayed. It is recommended that parents stop using a dummy once a baby is 6 months old.You may need to wean yourself from the convenience of popping in the dummy when your baby fusses and give extra attention, cuddling or nursing instead.To reduce or cut out dummy use, try:Offering to nurse instead.Restricting your baby’s dummy use to certain times such as only in the car.Carrying him, taking him for a walk in the buggy, giving him a bath, playing games, singing or sharing other interesting activities.If your baby has become accustomed to falling asleep with a dummy, the simplest option is to breastfeed him instead. From 6 months:Try gently removing the dummy once he is asleep or very sleepy so that he gradually learns to fall asleep without it.Keep trying as new sleep associations take a while to establish. You could introduce other sleep cues such as wrapping in a blanket, rubbing his back, rocking and/or a key word, for example ‘shh’.Extra time focussing on your baby’s needs whilst working to reduce dummy use will help the change go more smoothly. If you have any questions or need support as you wean your baby from using a dummy you can contact an LLL Leader by calling ourHelpline. You can find your local grouphere.Breastfeeding, Dummies and SIDSSome research has shown that using a dummy to settle a baby to sleep can reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (6,7). The cause and effect is unknown, and may be related to other protective factors. It is possible that a baby falling asleep with a dummy mimics babies falling asleep at the breast (8,9) Babies generally keep a dummy in the mouth for less than 15 minutes at sleep times (10)—similar to the time it takes a baby to breastfeed to sleep.Current recommendations for dummy use at sleep times (6,11) are that a dummy should:Not be used to replace breastfeeding.Not be replaced after a baby falls asleep.Not be given to a baby who doesn’t want it.It would seem from these recommendations, that a baby who breastfeeds to sleep is unlikely to want or need a dummy.*Sleep apnoea: irregular breathing during sleep.Further ReadingBeginning BreastfeedingMy Baby Needs More MilkNipple Confusion?Safe Sleep & The Breastfed BabySleepy Baby – Why & What To DoBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, LLLI.

"During pregnancy your body is preparing to give birth and your breasts are getting ready to feed your baby.  If you are told you need to have a caesarean birth you may wonder if you will still be able to breastfeed as you planned. Mothers successfully breastfeed after a caesarean birth and you can expect your healthcare professionals to support you with getting breastfeeding established straight away.Whichever way we give birth, our bodies need time to recover and to adjust to feeding a new baby. Birth by caesarean usually means a longer hospital stay, and a longer recovery time because this is major abdominal surgery so practical support from friends and family can make a big difference to you.Before the birthCommon concernsA good start for breastfeedingPractical help and supportBefore the birthWhichever way you will be giving birth, find out as much as you can beforehand about labour and breastfeeding. Whilst some aspects will be out of your control, choosing your place of birth and your caregiver can reduce your chance of a caesarean.An induced birth can lead to more interventions, increasing the chance you’ll need a caesarean.Continuous support during labour from a woman you feel comfortable with and trust can reduce the risk of a caesarean birth.Simple things like eating and drinking, moving around and relaxation can improve your experience of labour.Tell hospital staff beforehand that you plan to breastfeed and to emphasise:You want to keep your baby with you, provided neither of you needs special care.You don’t want your baby to be given bottles or dummies without your permission, because this will interfere with breastfeeding.An unplanned caesareanA caesarean after a long or difficult labour can leave you feeling extremely tired and frustrated. However the hormones released during labour have already prepared you and your baby for breastfeeding.A planned caesareanKnowing in advance that you will be having your baby by caesarean can let you prepare, both emotionally and practically. When possible, going into labour first can help get breastfeeding off to an easier start. If you have had a previous caesarean, it is not always necessary to have one the next time. Discuss your options with your health professionals.After an caesareanWhether or not your caesarean was planned, you may still feel upset or sad about what happened and mourn the loss of the birth experience you were hoping for. It is quite understandable to feel this way and these feelings may affect the way you feel about your baby and breastfeeding at first.Breastfeeding can give you confidence in your body’s abilities. When you breastfeed, your baby needs you. The close physical contact can also help you to feel better emotionally. Breastfeeding helps your womb to contract, which will help you heal more quickly. And it’s nature’s way of ensuring you spend time sitting or lying down, resting and recovering.Common concernsIVs or dripsTo make holding and feeding your baby easier, ask that your IV drip be inserted into your forearm, rather than in the back of your hand (and without the supporting board if one is used). You can request that your catheter be inserted after your spinal anaesthetic has taken effect, to make the procedure more comfortable.The extra fluid from an IV can increase engorgement. Before breastfeeding, you can easy any swelling back by pressing your fingers around the nipple area (reverse pressure softening) and seeEngorged Breasts—Avoiding and Treatingfor suggestions.IV fluid will also transfer to your baby. This can lead to an artificially high brith weight which may result in a higher percentage weight loss in the early days. Weighing your baby at 24 hours old may give a more accurate baseline weight.AnaestheticAny anaesthetic in your system will not be harmful to your baby. However the anaesthetic may make your baby very sleepy during the first few days—you may have to wake them up and encourage them to nurse. Keep them close and offer the breast whenever they stir.Antibiotics and pain reliefPain relief and antibiotics are routinely given after a caesarean. Pain relief will be essential to help you through the early days. Over the counter pain medications, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, are considered safe for breastfeeding. If you need something stronger, then discuss this with your health care team, who can check which drugs are compatible with breastfeeding. You may need further antibiotics, but be aware that these increase the risk of a thrush infection for you and your baby.A good start for breastfeedingExpress your milkSeparation or feeding problems are more likely if your baby is born early, if you have an induced birth, or if you have a health problem such as diabetes. It can be very helpful to express and store colostrum before the birth so that your milk will be available for your baby if separation occurs. SeeAntenatal Expression of Colostrum.If your baby is a bit sleepy at first you can hand express drops of colostrum and give it on a spoon. You partner could help with this.It can sometimes take a little longer to have a plentiful milk supply after a caesarean birth. Hand expressing frequently will encourage this process. If you baby needs a supplement offer it with a spoon, syringe, feeding cup or supplementer.Breastfeed as soon as possibleYou can breastfeed as soon as you are alert enough to hold your baby, in the recovery room or even on the delivery table. At this stage you will be free from pain as the anaesthetic will not have worn off. Although you may be lying flat on your back and may need some help positioning your baby, you don’t need to be sitting up to breastfeed. Simply lying there, skin-to-skin is enough to prompt a baby to nuzzle onto your breast themself. If you are drowsy your partner can help by holding your baby close to you.Skin-to-skin contact with your babyIt’s important and never too late, to enjoy skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Tuck a blanket over both of you to keep warm. Skin-to-skinEncourages your baby to latch on and feed frequently.Helps colonise your baby’s skin with your own individual ‘good’ bacteria.Calms your baby and regulates their temperature.Encourages bonding.If your need for medical care prevents this happening straight away, your birth partner can step in. Babies still benefit from sking-to-skin contact even when they can’t be with you.Get comfortable for breastfeedsGetting your baby attached well at the breast helps them to feed effectively and helps prevent nipple damage. Lying down, laid back or using the underarm position may be easiest at first. Use extra pillows for support and comfort—behind your back, under your arms or between your knees. A rolled up towel or small pillow can cover and protect your incision. . SeePositioning & Attachmentfor tips. Be aware that pain relief can mask pain during breastfeeding. If your nipples are squashed or flattened after feeds, or look sore or damaged, seek help without delay.Baby feeding cuesMothers often find they need help responding to their babies’ early feeding cues. If you feel groggy after birth, it helps if the people supporting you are aware of the signs your baby needs to feed. These include, in increasing urgency:Opening their mouth, making sucking motions and turning their head (rooting) looking for the nipple.Moving their tongue.Furrowing their eyebrows—perhaps showing tension in their face.Clenching and unclenching their fists.Flexing their arms.Moving their hands to their mouth.Followed by restless movement.Then crying—the last resort.Practical help and supportIt is useful to check hospital policies on visitors, so you can arrange as much help as possible. Even in hospital, it will be much easier with your partner, family member or friend to help you care for your baby. If you are on your own, ring for help from hospital staff when you need it.Once at home, extra help will be essential. You will be recovering from major abdominal surgery and need to rest, recover and concentrate on nursing your baby. You may be advised not to drive for about six weeks. Organise as much help as possible with meals, laundry and essential housework, and with caring for any older children. Drink enough fluids to keep your urine pale, and eat a balanced diet. Simple meals will be easier to prepare.SeeSupporting a Breastfeeding MotherandAdjusting to Motherhoodinclude practical tips on making life easier after birth.Support for breastfeedingTry to contact an LLL Leader, attend an LLL meeting or join an LLL Facebook group before your baby arrives to establish your support network.

Ideally do this within the first hour after birth before any interruptions such as washing and weighing.It’s never too late to startBiological Nurturing, even if your baby is sleepy due to drugs you had in labour—spending lots of time skin-to-skin helps babies breastfeed well.Breastfeed oftenBabies have tiny tummies so they can’t wait long for food.Encourage your newborn to breastfeed at least 8 to 12 times in 24 hours.Your colostrum (first milk) is made in just the right amounts for your baby’s tiny tummy.Small, frequent feeds ensure that your baby takes in all the milk he needs—the more you nurse, the more milk you will make.ColostrumThis concentrated milk produced in the first few days clears meconium (first poo), reduces jaundice. Colostrum provides their first immunity boost and lines and protects their intestines.Learn tobreastfeed comfortablyUse your baby’s natural reflexes to help them get a good latch.Get yourself comfortable and well supported. Nursing pillows can get in the way so tuck cushions in for support after your baby is latched, or to support your arms and back.Keep your breast at its natural level.Hold your baby so they are cuddled in close against you, their body in full contact with yours. So their whole front is close against yours, wrapped around or along your body.Align them ‘nose to nipple’ to encourage them to extend their neck. That will help them open their mouth wide and get a deep, comfortable latch.Seek skilled help early on if you are finding breastfeeding difficult or uncomfortable.Allow them to take a full feedThere is no need to time each breastfeed— they will let you know they have had enough by letting go or falling asleep.Offer the other breast if they want it. That way they’ll get what they need and your breasts will be encouraged to make plenty of milk.Watch for signs they are hungryWriggling or fidgeting, rooting (head turning) and fist sucking are all early signs of hunger.Offer a breastfeed while they are still calm—crying is a late sign of hunger.Just like you, they will be hungrier and thirstier at some times of the day than at others. Many babies ‘cluster nurse’ and space feeds closer together at certain times of the day, especially during the evening.Some babies sleep a lot at first because of the effects of anaesthetics during birth or because they’rejaundiced.  This can mean they’re not able to feed as much as they need. More information aboutsleepy babies.Watch for signs he is getting enough milkAfter your milk comes inListen for swallowing during feeds.At least three yellow 50p coin sized poos in each 24 hours are a sign they’re getting enough milk.Seek skilled help if your baby seems constantly unsettled, even after a long breastfeed.Encourage a sleepy baby to feed actively 10 to 12 times in 24 hours. Hold them more and encourage latching on when awake and during periods of light sleep.Is My Baby Getting Enough milk?Give only your milkYour healthy full-term baby doesn’t need any other fluids or solids until around six months.Giving infant formula or other liquids reduces your milk production and may trigger allergies.As well as affecting your milk production, bottles or dummies can confuse your baby’s sucking technique and make them reluctant to breastfeed. SeeDummies & Breastfeedingfor more about this.If a supplement is needed, try using a spoon, flexible feeding cup or syringe. Our article here may help with ideas of how to give your baby any extra milk:My baby needs more milk.Night feeds are importantYour baby will need to breastfeed during the night to ensure they take in enough milk.Night feeds will help you to establish and maintain your milk supply and avoid engorgement, blocked ducts and mastitis.You can make night feeds easier by keeping your baby close by.For more information see our page onSafe Sleep & the Breastfed Baby.Milk production speeds up (your body makes more milk faster) if you nurse or pump more frequently. The emptier the breast, the faster your body works to replace the milk that was taken out. Milk is being produced at all times, and breasts are only ever about 75% empty, even after a very long feeding. For more information on how your breasts make milk see:How milk production works.Get to know and enjoy your babyYou will soon learn what they need and enjoy. The easiest way to care for a newborn baby is to accept and meet their need for closeness.  Other family members can enjoy closeness too —by cuddling, changing, bathing or carrying baby in a sling.Settle into your own rhythmsThe responsibility of looking after a baby 24 hours a day can be quite overwhelming at first. Try to relax—soon you will find gentle patterns emerging. You can then build on these patterns, creating a daily rhythm to suit you both.  Read more aboutRhythms and Routines.Get out and aboutGoing out can prevent you feeling isolated and give structure to your day, entertain your baby and give you a sense of purpose. Breastmilk is the ultimate in travel food – no need to take bottles of formula with you. If you wish, it’s easy to be discreet while breastfeeding, so that other people may not even notice. It helps to practise at home in front of a mirror. Offer a feed before your baby gets frantic—after all, a crying baby will guarantee an audience! For more ideas see our articleOut and about with your breastfed baby.As time goes byYour healthy baby needs only your milk until about the middle of the first year, when they start to show signs of readiness for solids. If you are returning to work, you can express your milk and continue to breastfeed when you are together.Growth spurtsBabies have frequent growth spurts starting in the first few weeks. During a growth spurt your baby will be extra hungry—nurse as often as you can to increase your milk production. Your breasts will also feel softer and more comfortable as your milk production is established. This can coincide with a growth spurt. Don’t panic, you are still producing plenty of milk and feeding will settle down again soon.  Have a look at the ways you can tell if yourBaby Getting Enough Milk?Coping with engorgementBreastfeed as often as you can.Reverse pressure softeningmoves fluids away from the nipple area so your baby can latch on well:Press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple.Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola. You can also press with the sides of your fingers.Place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be. Gently hand express a little milk if needed.Warm moist heat just before feeding helps milk flow. Cold compresses between feeds help reduce swelling and pain.Help for sore nipplesRemember—getting your baby latched oncomfortablyis important for preventing sore nipples. Pain is a sign that something needs changing—seek skilled help. Nurse your baby before they are really hungry. Offer the least sore breast first and try different nursing positions. Insert your finger between your baby’s gums if you need to remove them from the breast. If you experience itchy or burning nipples or shooting pains during or between feeds talk with an LLL Leader to help identify the cause.Help for sore breastsA tender spot or a sore lump or a red area on pale skin may be a blocked duct. Avoid mastitis by nursing frequently to keep milk flowing. Use different nursing positions and check your baby’s attachment at the breast. Rest and treat as for engorgement. Avoid bras and clothing that cause pressure on the breast. Seek medical help if things don’t improve.Seek supportIt is OK to ask for help—it can take a while for breastfeeding to become easy, or for your baby to learn to breastfeed effectively. It will get easier as time goes on. You can easily get skilled help from an LLL Leader by calling ourHelpline.

"Mothers start to produce colostrum (early milk) while pregnant. Being able to express colostrum is a useful skill to have. Saving your expressed colostrum may also be beneficial if your baby is likely to need special care after birth.Why express while pregnant?Being familiar with your breasts and how they work will give you confidence for after the birth.You’ll be able to express a small amount of colostrum onto your nipple if your baby needs encouragement to feed.You’ll be able to express colostrum for your baby if he has difficulty feeding or is cared for in the neonatal intensive care or special care baby unit.Being able to hand express will help you avoid problems with engorgement and mastitis.If your baby doesn’t breastfeed well in the first few days, being able to hand express will help you:Express your milk if needed.Provide your own milk for your baby to prevent or treat conditions such as low blood sugar or jaundice.Avoid the need to give infant formula.Special circumstancesLearning to hand express while pregnant, and collecting and saving the colostrum can be helpful in some special situations, including:Planned caesarean or induced birthConsider expressing the day before birth so your milk is available if you and your baby are separated. This will be especially useful if your baby will be born early.Babies with a cleft lip or palateThis may be diagnosed during pregnancy. Babies with any form of cleft can find it harder to breastfeed. Breastfeeding is particularly important for the first six months as it helps protect these babies against ear and respiratory infections. When the cleft is repaired, your milk helps promote healing and protects your baby against hospital germs.Mothers with diabetesIn the first 24 hours after birth, babies of diabetic mothers risk developing low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). A baby needs colostrum to  maintain his blood glucose levels. Exclusive breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of a baby developing diabetes later in life.Mothers with breast abnormalities or who have had breast surgeryStored colostrum can be helpful if you encounter problems establishing milk production.Other medical conditionsSome medical conditions may make it harder for you and your baby to establish breastfeeding. Or, if you need to start medications that are incompatible with breastfeeding, your saved colostrum can still be given to your baby.Talk to your midwifeSome NHS hospital trusts already have policies in place for sharing information on antenatal expression. Your midwife and other members of your antenatal care team may have information to share on breast massage and how to hand express. They should also be able to give you small sterile syringes with identity labels in which to save your colostrum.Do ask if the hospital has an Infant Feeding Specialist who will be well informed about breastfeeding and a source of support in those early days.A handy techniqueHand expression is a useful technique to learn even though most mothers find they rarely need to express and store their milk. It is effective, convenient and free. You may also find you can express more milk by combining hand expression with pumping than using just a pump.When to start expressingIs it safe?Don’t worry – following the suggestions to express for a few minutes each day is unlikely to trigger labour. Check with your midwife if you are at risk for early labour. If you experience any uterus cramps when expressing, stop immediately and contact your midwife.Expressing during pregnancyIt helps to be warm and relaxed.You could practise in the bath or shower at first. When you start collecting colostrum, express after a bath or shower.Wash your hands.Massage your breasts to help milk flow.Hand express from one breast. Take care NOT to cause pain or discomfort.You are likely to see small droplets or drips of colostrum appear as you express. Express directly into the container so you save every precious drop. If you’ve been given syringes and find it difficult to collect your colostrum, express into a small clean container (e.g. cup) and draw the colostrum up into the syringe.You can express up to three times in the same day. If you plan to express again that day, store the syringe in the coldest part of the fridge. This is usually at the back.Once you’ve expressed for the last time that day, seal the syringe in a bag. Label and date it before placing it in the freezer. The colostrum could be kept in the fridge if you’re going to be induced or have a planned caesarean section within a day or two. Fresh colostrum inhibits the growth of bacteria and can be safely refrigerated for 48 hours.Why hand express?Hand expression is the best way to express colostrum. It is simple to learn and gets easier with practice. You’ll only be expressing small amounts so using a pump will be impractical and may not be as effective. You may receive information and a demonstration on hand expression from your midwife.Our articleHand Expression of Breastmilkalso describes an effective method. Antenatally, you’ll only need to express for three to five minutes – just until you have a few drops of colostrum. It may not seem very much, but a baby’s first feed is no more than a teaspoon of colostrum. By expressing up to three times in a day, you can express enough for a feed. With practice and regular stimulation, you’ll be able to express more colostrum.When you go into labourTake your stored colostrum with you to the hospital in a cool bag. The hospital can arrange to keep your colostrum frozen, possibly in the special care baby unit. Make sure you or your birth partner makes a note of where it is stored and that details are in your notes.If you and your baby are likely to have difficulties or be separated, one of the containers can be defrosted once you’re close to birth. This is then ready for the first feed, if needed.When baby arrivesYour baby will need to breastfeed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours. If, for any reason, you are separated or unable to breastfeed your colostrum can be defrosted if needed, one container at a time to avoid waste. Your colostrum can also be used if your baby needs supplements.The first few daysFrequent breastfeeding and keeping your baby close by will help establish your milk supply and get breastfeeding off to a good start. If you and your baby are separated, express milk eight times in each 24 hours including at least once at night, until your baby is able to breastfeed. Expressing as well as breastfeeding is important if your baby isn’t feeding well, or needs supplements for any reason. This will help establish milk production and provide milk for your baby’s next feed if needed.

It can be confusing to experience the emotional ups and downs— adjusting to being a mother takes time. Pain, tiredness, your birth experience, and how much support you have can all affect how you feel. When the reality of being a mother differs from your expectations, this can add to the feeling of being on an emotional roller-coaster. As well as experiencing ‘baby blues’, most mothers have days when they feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for a new baby. The suggestions here may help you find ways of feeling more in control, however old your baby is.Get to know and enjoy your babyThe responsibility of looking after a baby 24 hours a day can be quite overwhelming at first.Try to relax—you will soon learn what he needs and enjoys. The easiest way to care for a newborn is to accept and meet his need for closeness.After a while you will find gentle patterns emerging. You can then build on these patterns, creating adaily rhythmto suit you both.Bring your baby into your room or bed to get more rest.

Not all housework is equally important.Baby blues‘Baby blues’ is a mild, temporary condition associated with the falling hormone levels after birth. Around 30 to 85 percent of all new mothers experience ‘baby blues’, which usually start around 3 to 5 days after delivery.Some mothers simply find that they burst into tears for no apparent reason; others may experience mood swings, confusion, forgetfulness, headaches, negative feelings towards the baby, restlessness, irritability and nightmares. Fortunately, this condition typically lasts only a few days.In the early daysRest and sleep: It’s important to give yourself permission to rest and sleep: you have just done a major job in growing and giving birth to your baby. Try to set aside at least a week or two of recovery time.Breastfeed often: Breastfeeding and close physical contact with your newborn produces soothing hormones designed to calm you during these early days. Rigid schedules can have the opposite effect of causing more stress.Hold your baby: TryBiological Nurturing™—‘laid back’ positions can help breastfeeding go well and make you feel calmer and more confident.Spend time together: You may want to create a comfortable place for you and your baby to spend lots of time together, with as much privacy as you need.Limit visitors: It’s OK to limit visitors; you could ask your partner to explain that you’re tired or put a sign on your door ‘new mum and baby resting, please call back in a few days time’. If you’re wearing your dressing gown, or are in bed with your baby, visitors are less likely to overstay their welcome, and may even bring you a cup of tea.Plan ahead: Use an answerphone or set your mobile on silent to allow you to rest without being disturbed.DepressionIt’s very important to talk to your GP or health visitor if any of the negative feelings become intensified or if they last more than two weeks—for instance, if you feel overwhelmed, worried or cannot sleep. Depression in new mothers is not uncommon, and a lot of help is available to support mothers and their babies for whom this is a problem. If recognised and treated, mothers recover quite quickly and are then able to fully enjoy parenting their new baby.Medications are available which are safe to take while breastfeeding. Our Professional Liaison Department can give you information about whether a specific medication is safe to use while breastfeeding, contact alocal LLL breastfeeding counselloror call ourNational Telephone Helplinefor help.Homestartis a national family support charity that offers help and friendship to families with young children who are struggling to cope for whatever reason.Get out and aboutFresh air and sunshine are good for your well-being. Most mothers notice the importance of daily exercise for lifting their mood—it can be as simple as a short five to ten minute walk in the early weeks. Going out with your baby can also prevent you feeling isolated and give structure to your day.Before long you can take your baby for outings to the local park, and visits to the library and shops. Don’t try too much too soon though. Work up slowly.You could also start doing gentle, fun things with other mothers and babies eg baby massage, singing or swimming.Look after yourselfEating wisely can make a difference, including healthy snacks. Eating a well balanced diet that includes foods such as wholegrain bread and cereals, pasta, potatoes, rice, vegetables, beans and raw fruits, will help keep your blood sugar levels steady, protecting against depression and fatigue.Long-chain Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in your diet can help you cope with stress and may prevent depression. Sources include oily fish and enriched foods. Consult your doctor if you are considering taking supplements.Drink to thirst, and enough to keep your urine pale. Water is good, as is a daily glass of fruit juice. Avoid or limit alcohol, caffeine and fizzy drinks.Eating foods that include milk, bananas or complex carbohydrates before going to bed can help you sleep.Make yourself a priority when your baby sleeps: care for your own needs, including sleep and rest.The relaxation techniques you may have learnt for labour can be used now when you have a few minutes.You deserve time for yourself: make time for a bath, shower, to read a book or magazine, or watch a DVD while breastfeeding and cuddling your baby.Postnatal exercises are helpful, but avoid over-exerting yourself. Pain and tiredness can increase negative feelings.Spend time with other peopleEnjoying the company of other mothers, either face-to-face or online, can make you feel better.Local LLL meetingsare a good place to talk to other breastfeeding mothers, as are our onlineFacebook Groups. Children and Family Centres across the country also offer support and information to all parents.Seek prompt help for any breastfeeding problems, as continued pain can make you feel very low.What about talking to someone sympathetic? By talking about how you feel you may find ways of managing.Try to tell your partner what you need as it’s not always easy for others to know what you’re experiencing. Hand squeezes, hugs and positive words can go a long way.As time goes byTry to listen to your body and pace your activity to your energy level. As your baby grows, there will always be days when a rest or sleep while your baby sleeps is a good idea. Keeping up with a crawling baby or active toddler is hard work.If you’re feeling low remind yourself your baby needs you and loves you. Hold him close. He doesn’t need a perfect mother— just you.You are important too.Written by April Whincop, Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGB.

"When babies cannot feed at the breast comfortably and effectively, and breastfeeding support is hard to find or not able to help, mothers may choose to use a breast pump to express all the milk their baby needs, and then feed via a bottle or feeding tube. This is known as exclusive pumping. While this is often a temporary solution to protect milk supply until the baby is able to nurse directly at the breast, some mothers may find themselves exclusively pumping long term. Some mothers may also actively choose to exclusively pump and some mothers may be unable to feed their baby directly at the breast because their baby is poorly or has medical difficulties.The decision to exclusively express breastmilk usually stems from an awareness of the irreplaceable qualities of breastmilk. Mothers also find that providing their babies with breastmilk can help with the grief from not being able to nurse directly at the breast. If their baby has medical difficulties, many mothers feel strongly that providing human milk will give their child the best possible start, particularly if their baby is in hospital. Yet, exclusive pumping is a significant undertaking which requires dedication, information and support.You might find the decision to exclusively express feels difficult, and that you don’t feel you fit with breastfeeding mothers or with those using formula. Please be sure that you will receive a warm welcome and support at LLL meetings and from your local Leader, and that we understand the lengths you’re going to, to make sure your baby has your milk.This page concentrates on the practicalities of how and when to express your milk and feed it to your baby, to establish exclusive expressing as your feeding method. Sometimes it can help to focus on all these practicalities and, once you have a workable plan, to give yourself time too to process how you’re feeling about it, as you settle into life with your new baby. If you have a partner or supporter at home with you, all the things that are useful insupporting a breastfeeding motherwill apply to you too!Getting StartedEquipmentSetting your scheduleHow long is an expressing session?The importance of OxytocinHow to pumpHow much milk to pumpFeeding your breastmilkStoring your breastmilkStopping exclusively pumpingGetting StartedIf you have recently given birth and your mature milk has not yet come in, hand expressing is the most effective way of collecting colostrum to feed to your baby. It is important to start expressing colostrum within six hours (ideally after one hour, if possible) of giving birth, though if this doesn’t happen for you, it is still possible to get started.A newborn would expect to feed 8-12 times in 24 hours, and the feeds might not be evenly spread over that time, though they do need to include some feeds in the night; it is important to try to express breastmilk just as frequently in order to lay the groundwork for a robust milk supply later on. If you can have skin to skin contact with your baby while you’re expressing, it can really help, and a photo or something that smells of your baby can be a substitute. You can collect your colostrum in a syringe, a small clean cup or a spoon. See our article onHand Expression of Breastmilkfor more information on hand expressing, and you might also findthis videoon hands-on pumping helpful. This technique can be tricky to get the hang of, so please do ask your midwife or other breastfeeding supporter to help. It’s very common to need an extra pair of hands to collect the drops of colostrum.EquipmentAs your milk starts to transition, you will probably notice it start to change colour and spray out as you are expressing; this is a good time to introduce a breast pump. Although some women respond better to hand expressing, using a hospital grade double electric pump is the most effective way of removing breastmilk when a baby isn’t latching or is not nursing adequately. If you are planning on exclusively expressing for your baby long term, then it will be worth investing in a hospital grade double pump. If you would like to try one before deciding whether or not to buy it, your hospital or midwife may be able to provide you with one on a short-term loan. Alternatively, you can hire a pump, although it may turn out to be rather expensive if you are exclusively expressing long term.A breast pump usually comes with a collection set and the part that sits over your nipple/areola, which is called a flange. As women’s nipples and skin elasticity differ, flanges are available in different sizes. It’s important to ensure you have the right size for your nipples, as flanges that are too large or too small may cause pain or nipple damage and reduce the amount of milk you are able to express. Finding the right flange size may be a bit of a trial and error process; you may want to start by trying the standard size that comes with the pump (which varies for different pump brands) and see how you respond. If the standard flange sucks in too much areola, or if your nipple is at the back of the pump, you may need to go down a size. If, instead, you are left with a white ring around your nipple, you may need to go up a size.Many mums find being able to express handsfree invaluable in terms of allowing them to fit regular pumping sessions into their day. There are a small variety of pumps that provide milk collection cups that sit inside your bra, freeing you up to cuddle your baby without fear of spilling your milk. However, they tend to have a limited range of flange sizes. Alternatively, you can buy special bras designed to hold your pump flanges against your breasts, or you can even DIY your own by cutting holes in a stretchy bra that line up with your nipples.There are several other things to consider when choosing which hospital grade double pump to purchase or hire:– How often will you use it?If you are planning to exclusively pump long term, you may need to consider motor life, to make sure the pump you purchase will live up to its use.– How portable is it?If it uses a battery, then it can be carried around the house or out and about with you. Some pumps have built-in rechargeable batteries, while others offer the option to purchase a power pack or a car charger. Some pumps use removable batteries which are easy to replace if you unexpectedly run out of charge while away from a plug socket. However, using removable batteries may end up being rather expensive long term. You might find you end up using two different pumps – an efficient hospital grade one when you’re at home and a hand pump or battery pump when you’re out and about.– Can you purchase spare collection sets?Having a spare collection set or two can come in handy, as most mothers find that it is easier to stick to their pumping schedule if their pump is set up and ready to go at a moment’s notice, especially at nighttime.Setting your scheduleFor the first three-four months, you will need to express regularly to build a robust milk supply, ideally 8-12 times in 24 hours. Although you do not always need to pump at regular intervals, it is best not to go more than two to three hours between pumping sessions, with one longer stretch of four-five hours at night if you can take this break without damaging your milk supply. You will need to have at least one pumping session overnight, ideally between 2am and 5am when prolactin levels are highest. If you are able to pump when your baby wakes up for a feed, you may find it easier to do so than setting an alarm. If you need to set an alarm, but are having difficulty waking up, it may be worth experimenting with setting it for different times to try and coincide with the periods in your sleep cycle where you are in a lighter sleep. Many mothers find that they are able to express the most milk first thing in the morning, and less as the day goes on. You will notice your own patterns. It’s also common for one breast to produce more milk or have a faster flow than the other side.Working out ways to fit pumping sessions into your routine is key to long-term success. Some mothers will express while cooking, or holding a sleeping baby, or while travelling; sometimes before they feed their baby, sometimes afterwards. Experiment to find out what works best for your family and your daily rhythms.In the early days, you may find that you are producing more milk than your baby needs; this is common and it will settle down in a few weeks. It can be useful to freeze any excess milk in small portions for later on, should your baby suddenly require more milk, such as during a growth spurt or period of illness.Once your supply has established, usually between three and four months, you may decide to slowly reduce your number of daily pumping sessions. If you are planning to exclusively express long term, however, you may decide not to make any changes to your pumping schedule. If you start to reduce your expressing sessions, you may like to keep a record of your daily pumping outputs so that you can monitor what effect it has on your overall milk supply. You could start by increasing the intervals between your overnight pumping sessions, although it will still be important to express once at night. After doing this for about three-four weeks, you may consider dropping one daytime session. This may require you to adjust the time of all your other pumping sessions, in order to avoid leaving a big gap in between them, which could make you vulnerable to experiencing blocked ducts or mastitis.Once your baby starts eating solids reliably, around eight-nine months, you may start to notice a change in their milk requirements and can adjust your pumping schedule and milk supply accordingly. However, many mothers find that introducing solids does not affect milk intake for a lot longer (in some cases, 18 months). When your baby is sat in a highchair, it can be a good time to express your milk without them pulling on the pump tubes.How long is an expressing session?The length of each expressing session will vary for each mother, based on her breast storage capacity and the type of pump she uses. If you are able to express milk from both breasts at once, then you will find it much faster.While some experts recommend pumping for about 15-20 minutes, others believe that specifying the duration of a pumping session may not be helpful, as some mothers may take up to 45 minutes. In her book Exclusively Pumping Breastmilk,iStephanie Casemore suggests spending two hours over the course of 24 hours expressing. However, this total pumping time may need to be adjusted for mothers who need long individual expressing sessions. Also, other experts believe the total number of separate sessions to be more important than total pumping duration, with shorter, more frequent expressing sessions usually being more effective than fewer, longer sessions.As a general rule of thumb, you can express until your milk stops spraying, and then for an additional five minutes to stimulate another let-down. If you need to increase your supply, you can pump for 10 more minutes and use hand expression right after to remove as much milk as possible. Breast compressions and massage during sessions (hands-on pumping) also help to stimulate let-downs and maximise milk output. Some mothers find that it helps to experiment with “power pumping”, where they pump frequently for short periods, to mimic cluster feeding. This might be something to use on occasion rather than as part of a daily routine as it can be quite time-intensive.If, on the other hand, you need to decrease your supply, then slowly reduce the length of time you are expressing for. In both cases, many of the techniques discussed in our articles “My baby needs more milk” and “Too Much Milk and Oversupply” can be adapted for use with a breast pump.If you are worried that you do not have enough time to do a full session, then it is better to pump less time and have a longer session later, than to miss one entirely.Over time, as you reduce the number of pumping sessions, you may find that you will need to express for longer to obtain the same amount of milk. Many women find that if they cycle through their pump settings again, they can trigger a second or even a third let-down over a period of 30-45 minutes.The importance of OxytocinOxytocin is the hormone that triggers your letdown (milk ejection reflex). It is especially important to be mindful of this when expressing, as even mildly stressful situations of feeling rushed can make it difficult to trigger a letdown when using a breast pump. Many mothers find looking at their baby – or at pictures of their baby if they are separated – while expressing helpful. Gently massaging your breasts before and during your pumping session, as well as applying warm compresses or taking a warm shower before expressing can also trigger a let-down. Other ways to boost your oxytocin might include listening to music, watching a comedy on TV, reading a book, or browsing social media on your phone.If you are able to cuddle your baby while expressing, you may see an increase in your normal milk output! It is even possible to express while carrying your baby in a sling or baby carrier. As your baby gets older and more mobile, you may find it easier to remove yourself to a different room where you can relax without worrying about them pulling on your tubes, or getting into things they shouldn’t.It can feel disheartening if you are watching your collection bottles and feel that they are not filling up quickly enough. Covering the bottles with socks, or distracting yourself so that you are not watching, can be helpful. If you are struggling to get a let-down, it is ok to put your pump away and come back to it 10-20 minutes later and try again. If it is a persistent problem at certain times of day, try to remember that the stimulation you are giving your breast still has a valuable purpose.How to pumpIn order to keep pumping comfortable and avoid nipple damage, you may want to consider using lubrication, such as lanolin or olive oil, inside the pump flange to reduce friction. The flange needs to make a comfortable seal around the breast.Pumps have different suction and cycles settings. You may want to start with a low suction and high number of cycles to stimulate your let-down. Once your milk starts flowing, you can decrease the number of cycles and increase suction. In order to avoid getting sore, it is a good idea not to use the same suction setting for long periods of time. Switching between low and high suction also helps to trigger more let-downs.Once you are done pumping, you can massage both breasts and hand express to make sure your breasts are completely drained.How much milk to pumpAs breastmilk is highly digestible, breastfed babies tend to feed little and often. When babies nurse directly at the breast, milk intake varies from feeding to feeding, so the amount of breastmilk taken per bottle may also vary throughout the day. On average, babies need 750-1035ml of breastmilk per day between one and six months of age. You may want to pump slightly more than this to make sure you have enough milk when your baby goes through a grow spurt.Feeding your breastmilkBabies drink from a bottle and nurse from the breast in a completely different way. When drinking from a bottle, babies cannot control the flow of milk, which can be uncomfortable for them and can lead to overfeeding. In order to minimise this problem, you may want to feed your baby your expressed milk in a way that is as close as possible to nursing. This is often referred to as paced bottle feeding.Rather than feeding your baby bottles of expressed milk according to a strict schedule, you may want to feed on demand, as you would if they were nursing at the breast, being aware of early hunger cues. Holding your baby upright and keeping the bottle in a horizontal position allows the baby to suck actively, as he would at the breast, and to control the flow of milk, taking a break whenever he needs to. Offering the bottle teat gently, letting the baby draw it into their mouth, and feeding to satiation also allow the baby to be more in control of his feed. You can find more information on how to feed your baby your expressed milk in our article ‘Bottles and other tools‘.It’s important to remember that breastmilk should not be warmed up in a microwave or in a pan on the hob, in order to avoid damaging its nutrients. Shaking breastmilk is also not necessary.Storing your breastmilkBreastmilk’s antibacterial properties help it stay fresh, so it can be safely stored at room temperature for four-six hours and in the fridge for up to a week. If away from home, you could use a cool bag with ice packs. Our pageStoring Your Milkhas comprehensive details on safe periods for storing expressed milk for healthy babies. If your baby is unwell or premature, then follow hospital guidelines. Your baby will benefit more from fresh than frozen breastmilk because its living properties will help him fight off possible infections, however all human milk is beneficial for you baby.You may well see that your expressed milk is not always the same colour, and that it separates into layers when it has been stored for a while. Neither of these is a cause for concern, and a gentle swirl of the container before you feed your milk to your baby should make the layers mix again.If you find that you are producing more milk than your baby needs, you might like to consider donating your milk by registering as a donor for your local breastmilk bank.Stopping exclusively pumpingWhen you feel ready to stop expressing milk for your baby, it’s important not to rush into dropping pumping sessions, in order to avoid the risk of experiencing blocked ducts or mastitis. Your breasts need time to adjust, so it’s best to adopt a gradual approach. You could try to reduce the length of your pumping sessions by a few minutes over a few weeks, or you could try slowly increasing the intervals between sessions.Exclusive pumping, while also doing the day to day work of looking after your baby, can be exhausting, and sometimes mothers and parents wrestle with feeling guilty about having stopped “too soon”. By taking on the work of exclusive pumping, though, you gave your baby a wonderful gift.Written by Nicola Sheldon (LLL Berkshire and Oxfordshire) and Eva Williams (LLL Oxfordshire), May 2020.Thanks to Harriet Valentino for her input and to Lois Rowlands, Rae Vacher Lowe and Laura Loasby for the photos.Further readinghttps://laleche.org.uk/hand-expression-of-breastmilk/https://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-needs-more-milk/https://laleche.org.uk/too-much-milk-and-oversupply/https://laleche.org.uk/bottles-and-other-tools/https://laleche.org.uk/expressing-your-milk/#Pumpshttps://laleche.org.uk/storing-your-milk/A mother’s story from our members magazine breastfeeding mattershttps://kellymom.com/category/bf/pumpingmoms/pumping/Exclusively Pumping Breastmilk, Second edition.

"When you have early breastfeeding problems, it can feel as if it’s “all gone wrong” and the dreams you had about feeding your baby are in ruins.  Fortunately, babies are very adaptable and resilient, and so are their mothers!  With time, patience and, if necessary, skilled help, it is almost always possible to get feeding back on track after a difficult start.  It is always possible to have a close, warm, happy feeding relationship with your baby – even if it might look different from what you had expected.  It is important to act quickly, as soon as there are signs that things aren’t going well,  but even if more time has passed, things can still get better.Some examples of early difficulties:You had a more complicated birth. Babies born with the aid of forceps, for example, often take a few days to recover and feed well.  If you needed a lot of pain relief in labour, your baby may be sleepy at first.Your baby was born early, or small for their gestational age. See alsobreastfeeding premature babiesandlate preterm babies(those born between 34 and 37 weeks).You and your baby were separated after birth because one or both of you needed medical care.Your baby is very sleepy and doesn’t have enough energy to breastfeed. See alsosleepy babyandnewborn jaundice.Your baby gets frustrated or upset when they try to breastfeed. See alsomy baby won’t breastfeedandthe unhappy breastfed baby.Breastfeeding is very painful for you. See alsonipple pain.Your baby has a physical challenge such astongue-tie.Your baby is growing more slowly than expected. See alsomy baby needs more milk.Your milk production is lower than you would like it to be. SeeHow to increase your milk supplyandHow milk production works.You have plenty of timeParents sometimes worry that if their baby isn’t breastfeeding well, or at all, in the first few hours, days or weeks after birth, it will never happen.  While breastfeeding in the first hour after birth is ideal, the window of opportunity for babies to start breastfeeding, and to get better at it, is much longer than this.  The early feeding reflexes, which keep babies seeking and attaching to the breast, last for at least two to three months.  Where there is milk, there is always the possibility of breastfeeding.First things firstSorting out breastfeeding problems can feel overwhelming.  There seems to be so much to do, and you might feel you have to do it all at the same time!  It is helpful to know what is urgent and what is less urgent.  This can help you to work out what to do in what order, and how best to use your time and energy.Priorities – the “3 Keeps”If it’s taking time for breastfeeding to get going:Keep your milk flowingKeep your baby fedKeep your baby closeThis useful summary can be downloaded as a free A4 posterhere.Keep your milk flowingUnderstanding how milk production worksIt is possible to restart your milk production after stopping breastfeeding.  It is even possible to start milk production if you have never been pregnant![i]But it is usually much easier to get your milk supply going if you have just given birth – your body expects to make milk at this time.It is easiest to increase milk production in the first month or so after birth, when your breasts are most receptive.  After this, it usually becomes more difficult, because your body is not expecting to make more milk.  Even so, some women are able to get a big increase in their milk production later than this.  It’s always worth giving it a go, if you want to!Milk production usually increases quickly in the early days after birth and reaches almost peak production by about 10 days.  By about a month after birth, most women are making as much milk as their babies will ever need.  Babies need about the same amount of milk each day from one to six months of age  (from about six months, as they start eating other foods, the amount of milk that they need starts to reduce).When your baby is born, even if they are born early, you are already making milk. After birth, milk will only keep on being made if milk is being removed from your breasts.  If no milk is removed, your milk will dry up within about two weeks.  Your breasts will adjust to make the amount of milk that is being removed from them.If your baby is feeding well and taking as much milk as they need to feel satisfied and grow well, you will continue to make plenty of milk for your baby – or two or more babies, if you have more than one!Whenever a baby is not feeding well enough to take as much milk as they need, or is not feeding at the breast at all yet, the risk is that your breasts will adjust to making less milk than your baby needs.  This is why, if your goal is to breastfeed your baby exclusively (only on your milk) when they are ready,it is vital to make sure that you remove enough milk from your breasts in the early days and weeks after birth.You are removing enough milk if your baby is growing normally and producingwet and dirty nappies as expected, without needing anything other than your milk.For more information about how milk production works, see our articleHow milk production works.Why breastfeeding might be difficult at firstThe most common reason for a baby not to feed well is that they arenot quite getting a deep enough mouthful of breast.  When this happens, breastfeeding might hurt, the skin on your nipples may become damaged and/or your nipples might look pointy, like a new lipstick, when your baby comes off the breast.  Skilled face to face breastfeeding support usually helps most in this situation.Another common reason for babies not to feed well is thatthey don’t yet have enough energy.  They may be keen to breastfeed, and feed well for a short time, but they get tired before they get as much milk as they need.  This group may include babies who were born early, had a more difficult birth, are small, unwell, jaundiced, tongue-tied, etc.  They need more time and support (and medical treatment if necessary) until they are ready to breastfeed fully.Some mothers may need extra support with getting feeding started and a small number of mothers are not able to make all the milk their babies need. Reasons for this include:A history of infertility due to hormonal imbalances.Past breast surgery, especially breast reduction.Breast hypoplasia/Insufficient Glandular Tissue (IGT). Breasts may be unusually small, unevenly sized, long and thin, with a wide space between them.  There may be no breast changes, such as increase in size and tenderness, during pregnancy and after birth.Very large blood loss after birth – enough to make you very unwell.PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome).Thyroid problems (over- or under-active).You may have read that being overweight or obese (having a higher BMI, especially over 30) can lead to breastfeeding problems. It is not clear whether having a higher BMI, by itself, is a problem for breastfeeding and many women with high BMI breastfeed easily. We do know that some conditions associated with higher BMI, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, may delay your milk “coming in” (increasing in volume) in the early days after birth. This can make breastfeeding more challenging.If you have any of the risk factors above, it is important to have skilled help with breastfeeding so that you can get off to the best possible start. You can find more information in other articles on our website on:How milk production worksIncreasing your milk supplyIf you have done all you can to:Help your baby attach deeply to the breastMake sure your baby feeds at least 8-12 times in 24 hoursKeep your baby active at the breast by using compressions and switching sides when your baby stops actively feeding (you can find out how to do both of thesehere)but your baby still isn’t growing as expected, or there are other reasons to think that your baby is not getting all the milk they need, then it is important to start expressing your milk quickly.Your baby also needs to be checked by a doctor.Most babies who grow slowly are well, but occasionally slow growth can be a first sign of underlying illness, so it’s important to rule this out.Turning feeding around – changing directionWhen a baby is breastfeeding but is not feeding efficiently yet and is growing slowly, it is tempting to spend more and more time trying to breastfeed your baby.  This can end up being a negative cycle:because not enough milk is being removed, milk production decreases;because milk production is decreasing, the milk is harder for the baby to remove;because the baby is getting less milk than they need, their energy decreases;because they are feeding with less energy, breastfeeding becomes less effective and less milk is removed.Expressing your milk creates a positive cycle:because more milk is being removed, your breasts make more milk;because milk production is increasing, the milk is easier for your baby to remove;because your baby is getting more milk, their energy increases;because your baby is feeding with more energy, breastfeeding becomes more effective and more milk is removed.Active breastfeedingIf your baby is spending a lot of time breastfeeding but is not growing as expected, you may need to limit their time at the breast, to give you enough time to express.  Breastfeed while your baby is actively feeding, with deep sucks and swallowing after every one-two sucks. When your baby is only swallowing after every three sucks, or more, they are no longer actively feeding, and it would be more efficient to end the feed and express milk instead. A baby who breastfeeds “all the time” is probably asleep and not feeding actively for much of this time (light, fluttery sucks, very little swallowing).Expressing milkThis protects milk production by removing more milk from your breasts than your baby is able to take on their own.  If your goal is for your baby only to have your milk, your aim will be to express enough milk so that your baby can grow as expected and seem satisfied just on your milk.How often to expressIf your baby is able to get almost enough milk at the breast, you might only need to express once or twice a day.  If next time your baby is weighed, they are still growing slowly, increase the number of expressions.If there is a big gap between the amount of milk your baby is able to get at the breast and the amount your baby needs, you will need to express more often, if your goal is for your baby to be fed only or mostly on your milk.  If your baby is not breastfeeding at all, you would need to express at least 8-12 times in 24 hours, which is how many times most babies need to breastfeed.You don’t need to express regularly (most babies don’t feed regularly), just whenever you can.  The important thing is how many times you express in 24 hours – it’s up to you when you do it.  Experiment to see what works best. It’s fine to take a break for a few hours to go out or to sleep!  More, shorter expressions often work better than fewer, longer ones and it’s fine to stop in the middle of expressing, if you need to do something else. You might find that you get a new flow of milk when you start again.  Even if you only have a few minutes, it’s worth expressing.How to expressFor most women, the best tool for doing a lot of expressing (more than once or twice a day) is a double electric breast pump. Manual and single pumps are very small tools for this very big job, though some people find that they can express plenty with a small pump, or just using their hands.  You can find more information about how to express milkhere.Expressing longer-termMothers who need to express milk beyond the early weeks may find that they can reduce the number of times they express, while still getting the same amount of milk. You can read more about this (sometimes called the “magic number”)hereand find out why it varies so much between womenhere.  Some mothers can get all the milk they need just by expressing two or three times in 24 hours!  Some mothers feed their babies exclusively on expressed milk.  You can read more about this in the book “Exclusively Pumping Breastmilk”.For more information about how to increase your milk supply, our articleHow to increase your milk supplymay be of help.Keep your baby fedBabies always feed as well as they can – they are never “lazy” or uncooperative!  If feeding is not going well yet, it is because it is difficult for your baby at the moment.  They need extra support with feeding until they are able to do all the work by themselves.If your baby is able to do almost all the work of feeding,breast compression and switching sides when they are no longer actively feedingmay be enough to help them get all the milk they need at the breast.If your baby is unable to get all the milk they need at the breast even with some help, they will need extra milk, for the time being.How much milk do babies need?In the first 24 hours of life babies need an average of about 7ml (1 ½ teaspoons) of milk per feed. This roughly doubles every day for the first few days. If you are expressing your milk, for example because your baby was born early, it helps to know how much to aim for:500ml of milk in 24 hours by 10 days old;750ml of milk in 24 hours by two-three weeks old.Some babies need more or less milk than this – these are average amounts.  Some babies need as much as 1300ml of milk in 24 hours.If your baby was born early, they might need much less milk than this at the moment, but this gives you an idea of how much milk they are likely to need when they reach term age and size. It is important to aim for these amounts in the early weeks (if your goal is to feed your baby only on your milk) because it becomes more difficult to increase milk production later on. It is helpful to keep a record of how much you are expressing, so you can see how things are changing over time. If you are not expressing anything like these amounts yet, it is important to find a skilled feeding supporter quickly.What kind of milk?The first choice of extra milk is always a mother’s own expressed milk, which is tailor-made for her baby. The second choice is donated milk from another mother. The safest way to get donated milk is from a registered Milk Bank.[ii]When these are not available in the amounts needed, infant formula milk may be necessary.Formula milkWhen you were looking forward to breastfeeding your baby, it can feel disappointing to realise that they need formula milk as well. You might even wonder whether it is worth carrying on breastfeeding, or whether your baby will come to prefer formula milk. It can help to think of formula milk as a kind of medication, to give your baby the energy they need to breastfeed well.  You can read here abouthow to use formula milk strategically to support breastfeeding.  It is often possible to reduce the amount of formula milk that your baby needs, as they get better at breastfeeding and your milk supply increases.  If you need to use formula milk during the whole time your baby is fed only with milk, you may be able to reduce it after your baby starts eating other foods as well, from about six months.How to feed extra milk to your babyThere are many options for feeding your baby extra milk.  You can find information about choosing and using bottles, cups and morehereand about nursing supplementers (a tool that enables you to feed extra milk at the breast while your baby breastfeeds)here.  Your feeding supporter can help you decide which options might work for your baby.Keep your baby closeBreastfeeding provides more than just milk – it gives you and your baby lots of time to touch, gaze at and enjoy being with each other.  These, much more than the milk itself, are what builds strong connections between breastfeeding mothers and their babies.  Mothers (and dads, co-parents and other key adults) are able to build strong relationships with their babies when they are feeding in other ways, too.Skin to skin contactis an amazing way for your baby to connect with the important people in their life.  Babies held skin to skin are calmer, more relaxed, warmer, cry less and have more stable heart rates and breathing than babies who are wrapped up.  They are also protected against infection by being exposed to the “good bacteria” on your skin.  And it feels lovely!  You can read more about the magic of holding your baby skin to skinhere.“Wearing” your babyin a sling or carrier is a great way to keep your baby close while you get on with other things.  Being carried gives your baby many benefits, including more to look at, physical exercise, and less crying. You can read more about carrying your babyhere.When breastfeeding is stressfulWhen breastfeeding is difficult for your baby it may become stressful for both of you. Babies who have had stressful experiences at the breast can develop negative associations with breastfeeding. This might happen, for example:When a baby is in pain or discomfort after birth.When a more sensitive baby is handled in a way they don’t like.When milk supply is low, or a baby has a physical restriction that makes attaching and sucking difficult.A baby who is finding feeding hard may become upset:A short time into the feed, when milk flow slows down.At the start of the feed, when milk doesn’t come straight away.When offered the breast.When put in a breastfeeding position.When they see the breast.When feeding isn’t going well, babies may come to associate the breast with feeling hungry and frustrated. They may develop apreference for another feeding method, such as a bottle, if they associate it with feeling full and satisfied.If you and your baby are in this situation, you might need a “breastfeeding break”.  You could stop trying for a few days, while expressing your milk to keep your baby fed and protect your milk supply.  When you’re both ready, you can try again.Happy time at the breastHowever hard feeding has been, your baby can still discover that the breast is a great place to be, where they feel calm, relaxed and satisfied.  Here are some things you could try:If your baby has been refusing to feed, then try offering the breast when they are calm rather than when they are already hungry or upset.If your baby is having extra milk, give some or most of their feed by cup, bottle, etc. before letting your baby finish the feed on the breast.Laid-back breastfeeding.Allowing your baby to find their own breastfeeding position and to attach themselves can work especially well for babies who have had stressful experiences of being “put” to the breast.If you are giving extra milk, try giving it with yourbaby’s cheek resting against your bare breast.Consider using anursing supplementerso your baby can have extra milk while they breastfeed. This can be helpful when milk supply is low.“Breast-sleeping”.Let your baby end a feed by sleeping with their cheek pillowed on the breast.  Babies who are having all their milk by cup, bottle, etc. can enjoy doing this too.Take a bath with your baby. Low lighting and relaxing music can help set the scene!  Some babies will find their own way to the breast, and even if they don’t latch and feed, the bath can be a good place to learn to feel comfortable near the breast.Consider sleeping with your baby. Some babies will attach and feed in their sleep, if the breast is near enough to smell and feel when they stir in the night.Always considersleep safetybefore sleeping with your baby in your bed.   It is never safe to sleep with a baby on a sofa.Babies are hardwired to breastfeedBreastfeeding is an essential survival behaviour and all healthy babies will continue to try for many weeks after birth.  As long as your milk supply is protected, and your baby is fed, you and your baby have plenty of time to learn to breastfeed.  You can find a feeding relationship that works for you both – even if it isn’t quite what you imagined before your baby arrived.  ‘Successful breastfeeding’ can look like many different things for different families.Getting skilled support can help, as can hearing from other mothers who had a difficult start with breastfeeding and have found their way through it. La Leche League groups welcome anyone who is breastfeeding or providing their own milk for a baby or trying to do so. Please don’t feel awkward about needing to give your baby extra milk, in any way you need to, at an LLL meeting! We would love to meet you and your baby.

"Women hear a lot of conflicting information about what they can or cannot eat while breastfeeding and these recommendations may vary according to culture and tradition, along with individual personal preference and finances. In some cultures a food may be considered beneficial to a breastfeeding mother, but in another culture mothers may be cautioned against the exact same food.  For instance, spicy food is considered bad for babies in some societies, but in others spices form a big part of everyday cuisine.Here are some myths and facts about a woman’s diet and breastfeeding.Composition of BreastmilkMyth: Breastmilk is made directly from what an individual eatsBreastmilk is made in the breasts, directly from a mother’s blood. It is not made directly from the food she eats.When food, drink or medication are ingested, the substance is broken down by the digestive tract and molecule-sized components of the substance are absorbed into the blood. When these molecules get to the capillaries near the breast tissue, they move through the cells that line the alveoli and into the milk. This process is known as diffusion.Diffusion explains how drugs and other foreign substances enter milk. Many factors influence whether or in what quantity a substance will actually enter the milk.The process of diffusion allows good things, such as antibodies, to easily enter colostrum and mature milk. This means that breastmilk changes over time in sync with the mother’s environment, which is one of the important health aspects of breastfeeding.Myth: If a woman has a poor diet the quality of her milk will not be good enoughBreastmilk is a living substance that evolves in sync with the needs of a baby at every feed. It contains vital nutrients, immunity building cells and stem cells, food for healthy gut bacteria and many other health factors that cannot be replicated. These do not change with an individual’s diet. People who experience famine conditions still produce milk providing optimal nutrition for their babies.The type of fat in maternal diet is closely related to the type of fat in the milk the mother produces, although the caloric content of human milk is fairly consistent.[i]Breastfeeding responsively ensures that babies will receive all they need in order to grow well and remain healthy.Caring for and feeding a baby from your own body can use up a lot of energy at times.  Eating a variety of nourishing and energy boosting foods as often as possible, can help to optimise your own health and energy reserves. Asking friends and family to provide such foods to you regularly in the early weeks and months can be a big support to you and your baby.Fact: Some foods can change the taste of breastmilkStrongly flavoured foods, such as garlic, chilli or soy sauce, may change the taste of breastmilk. It’s possible that this can help a baby get used to the family diet before starting solids.Babies will have already started to get used to these flavours during pregnancy when they swallow amniotic fluid.Children acquire their family’s food habits and preferences gradually.Fact:Breastmilk protects against toxinsAlthough a healthy diet could be defined as varied, balanced, and natural (i.e. grown in situations that eliminate or limit pesticides, insecticides, and chemical fertilisers), breastmilk contains high levels of antioxidants which may help to compensate for any pre-natal and post-natal exposure to environmental chemicals. Breastmilk can counteract the neurological effects of contaminants transferred before birth, and also any in the milk.Research has shown that milk produced by vegetarian women has lower levels of environmental contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These substances are stored principally in the fatty tissues of the body, and vegetarian diets tend to contain less fats than diets with more animal products.[ii][iii]It is generally suggested that anyone, breastfeeding or not, avoids fish which may be high in mercury. This includes predator fish such as swordfish and shark or freshwater fish from waters reported as contaminated by local health agencies.[iv]Mother’s dietMyth:You need to eat special foods to breastfeedA breastfeeding mother doesn’t require special foods to produce milk or increase her milk supply. Milk production is determined by the amount of milk removed from the breast.Unless there is a physical or physiological reason for low milk production, a mother who breastfeeds on cue will be able to produce enough milk for her baby, regardless of what she eats.[v]There is no particular food that must necessarily be eaten, especially if this is something that the mother is not used to or doesn’t like.[vi]All the nutrients that are found in one food are also found in others, so a mother can still get the nutrients she needs. For example, omega fatty acids can be gained through algal or soybean oil, walnuts, chia, hemp and flax seeds instead of fish.Myth:You need to drink milk to makemilkHuman beings are the only animals that consume milk produced by other animals.No other mammalian mothers drink milk, yet they all produce milk perfectly tailored to the needs of their young.Milk is sometimes seen as a source of calcium, but there are plenty of other easily available foods such a broccoli, peppers and spinach which contain even more calcium per serving as well as other nutrients too.In some cultures, people traditionally do not drink milk or eat dairy products at all, yet mothers succeed in breastfeeding their children.Myth:If you are vegan you won’t be able to breastfeedThe concept of an “ideal” diet can vary across different families, cultures, economic situations, religions, and also different seasons. Yet, almost always, all over the world, even in situations of deprivation, mothers produce milk that helps their babies grow well.Vegan diets can sometimes be low in Vitamin B12, and It’s important to know how to keep your vitamin B12 levels up.[vii]SeeVitamins and Mineralsfor suggestions on how to absorb enough.Fact: A breastfeeding mother may feel hungry and thirsty more oftenBreastfeeding can make us use up more calories than usual and we may feel more hungry and thirsty.How many extra calories we need depends on how much breastmilk we are producing (influenced by baby’s age and whether breastfeeding is exclusive), percentage of body fat (including how much body fat we have laid down in pregnancy), body size, and how active we are.A woman’s metabolic rate becomes more efficient during lactation and a small increase in grains, vegetables and fruit may be all that is needed.Weight gained during pregnancy is often gradually lost throughout the course of breastfeeding.Many mothers feel thirsty when they breastfeed, especially when their baby is newborn. It’s a good idea to have a glass of water available while breastfeeding, but it’s not necessary to drink more than you feel comfortable with, as it doesn’t help to increase milk supply and it may be unpleasant.[viii]Some women like to drink herbal teas and infusions to increase liquid intake. However, excessive amounts of some herbal teas and infusions can risk depleting milk supply, so they need to be used moderately and with caution.[ix]AllergiesMyth: Certain foods always need to be avoidedThere are no specific foods you always need to avoid just because you are breastfeeding.However, if parents suffer from allergies this can increase the possibility of their baby having the same allergy. Allergic reactions to substances in mother’s milk may appear as skin, respiratory and intestinal problems (or a combination of any of these) in a baby.If a baby has an obvious reaction every time a mother eats a certain food, she may choose to eliminate that food from her diet. Keeping a food diary can help identify if a pattern of fussy behaviour emerges every time a particular food is eaten.Although mothers may be advised to avoid high-risk foods during all or part of their pregnancy and to continue to avoid these foods during lactation, research indicates that this practice does not decrease the incidence of allergy by two years of age, but it does delay the onset of allergy.[x]More recent research shows that avoiding high-risk foods, such as peanuts, may not be necessary.[xi][xii]Normal caution may be needed if drinking raw, unpasteurised juices. If a mother were to develop food poisoning from inadequately washed ingredients this would not pass to her baby via her breastmilk.  However, it could be passed on via contact contamination.[xiii]Fact:Food allergies in breastfed infants are usually due to substances passing into breastmilk rather than breastmilk itselfSubstances in breastmilk coat a baby’s intestines, which prevent microscopic food particles from “leaking” through into your baby’s bloodstream.When food particles do pass into the blood (something that is more frequent in a formula fed baby), these food particles may be treated as foreign substances by his white blood cells, which attack them, and can cause painful allergic reactions.The top three food antigens are cow’s milk protein (mostly the betalactoglobulin component), soy bean protein, and egg white. Other common antigens are peanuts and fish, especially cod.Fact:A mother’s diet does not affect the amount of lactose in her milkThe amount of lactose in a mother’s milk has nothing to do with her diet; her body manufactures lactose solely for her baby.Lactose intolerance occurs when the body no longer makes enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to digest lactose, the main carbohydrate in milk. Lactose intolerance is rarely a problem for babies. They are born with the ability to produce lots of lactase because they depend on their mother’s milk for nutrition in the first year of life and the lactose in mother’s milk is needed for brain development.Some infants experience galactosemia, an extremely rare genetic condition that is present from birth and affects an individual’s ability to metabolise the sugar galacatose properly, hence requiring urgent medical care.Fact:Excess lactose in babies can be misdiagnosed as an allergy or colicHigh volumes of lactose can overwhelm a baby’s digestive system. This can be caused by babies consuming large amounts of breastmilk, or when mothers have oversupply.When there is not enough lactase to break down all the lactose, the excess lactose causes gassiness and discomfort, and frequently green, watery or foamy stools, sometimes with small amounts of blood.Vitamins and MineralsMyth:There is not enough iron in breastmilkThe iron in human milk is more readily absorbed by your baby than iron in cow’s milk or iron-fortified formula. This means that the quantity of iron in human milk is optimal for your baby, despite being less than that found in cow’s milk.As with calcium, the levels of this mineral in human milk are constant, despite variations in the maternal diet or the mother’s body stores.[xiv]A full-term healthy baby usually has no need of additional iron until about the middle of his first year, around the time he starts taking solids.Some vitamins and proteins are better absorbed if other vitamins and minerals are present at the same time. For example, iron is utilised better if vitamin C is present in the diet.[xv]The high lactose and vitamin C levels in human milk aid the absorption of iron, and breastfed babies do not lose iron through their bowels.Fact: Vitamin B 12 and calcium are important for a balanced dietVitamin B12 and calcium are important for a balanced diet. Some people, including vegans and vegetarians, use a supplement for their vitamin B12 intake.One study found that while vegetarian mothers tended to consume less calcium than other mothers, this did not affect the levels of calcium in their breastmilk.[xvi]If a mother is not consuming dairy products, calcium can be obtained from other sources, such as bok choy (a type of cabbage), sesame seeds, calcium enriched tofu, tamari, soy sauce, greens, whole grains and some nuts and dried fruit. For example, a cup (227 grams) of cooked bok choy provides 86 percent of the amount of calcium contained in a cup (240 ml) of milk. Half a cup (113 grams) of ground sesame seeds – which can be added to baked goods, pancake batter, or sprinkled on salads or cereals – contains twice as much calcium as a cup (240 ml) of milk.Other sources of calcium include blackstrap molasses, calcium-enriched tofu, collards, spinach, broccoli, turnip greens, kale, almonds, and Brazil nuts. Some types of algae (sea vegetables, such as wakame) fermented foods (miso), and seasonings including tamari and soy sauce can also contribute to enriching a diet with calcium, as well as many other minerals that are especially important to a breastfeeding mother.[xvii]Fact: Iodine and selenium are crucial mineralsIodine and selenium are crucial minerals. Good food sources of iodine include kelp, seaweed, sea fish, shellfish and grey Celtic sea salt. Iodine can also be found in plant foods, such as cereals and grains, but the levels vary depending on the amount of iodine in the soil where the plants are grown.[xviii]The best dietary source of selenium is Brazil nuts. It is widely found in other plant and animal foods, including other nuts, cereals, meat, fish and eggs.[xix]Fact:Vitamin D deficiency (rickets) occurs because of a deficiency in sunlight exposure, NOT because of a deficiency in human milk.Vitamin D is different from some of the other vitamins in our food, as it is actually a hormone produced by the kidneys. Vitamin D controls blood calcium concentration and affects the immune system, and is produced by the body when sunlight hits the skin.Breastmilk doesn’t naturally contain high levels of Vitamin D as, in the past, babies would absorb most of their Vitamin D from exposure to sunlight.Changes in the way we live our lives, with reduced exposure to sunlight, and with the foods we        eat which don’t contain sufficient Vitamin D, might mean that mothers don’t have enough            vitamin D in their own bodies to pass to their babies via breastmilk.Our bodies are designed to make very large amounts of vitamin D through exposure to the sun (10,000-20,000 IU in 24 hours, after 15-20 minutes of summer sun exposure in a bathing suit or 45-60 minutes of exposure for those with darker skin tones). However, in adults and children, the desire to avoid overexposure and sunburn has eclipsed our ability to absorb adequate amounts of sunlight to keep our vitamin D status at a normal level.[xx]Fact:Somewomen may need extra Vitamin DBreastfeeding mothers who have adequate amounts of vitamin D in their bodies can successfully provide enough vitamin D for their nursing children through breastmilk. However, lifestyle changes have led to some women not having enough vitamin D.It is recommended that pregnant and nursing mothers obtain adequate vitamin D or supplement as necessary. Women who are unsure of their vitamin D status undergo a simple blood test before making a choice to supplement.The optimal way to get Vitamin D is through sunlight and the NHS states: “Between late March/early April to the end of September, most people can get all the vitamin D they need through sunlight on their skin and from a balanced diet. You may choose not to take a vitamin D supplement during these months.”[xxi]The Vitamin D Council states that women taking a supplement of 6,000 IU of vitamin D each day shouldn’t need to give their baby a vitamin D supplement, as their breastmilk will contain enough vitamin D. However, women who aren’t taking a supplement or are taking less than 5,000 IU/day of vitamin D, or aren’t getting a good amount of sun exposure, should give your baby a vitamin D supplement.[xxii]If a baby is born with a deficiency in Vitamin D, due to the mother’s own low levels, this may not be reversed by the mother taking supplements.[xxiii]Research[xxiv]has demonstrated that children are able to store several months worth of vitamin D when they are exposed to only a few hours of summer sunlight.Gas/fussinessMyth: Food which makes a mother gassy will make her baby gassySometimes a mother finds that foods like broccoli and cabbage make her gassy. Gas from a mother’s intestinal tract cannot pass into her blood and eventually into her breastmilk for her baby to drink.However, when food is digested, some of the proteins do enter the blood and may then pass into a mother’s milk. Some babies may be sensitive to a particular protein and react with gas and fussiness.In many families, nursing mothers can eat whatever they like and be confident that the vast majority of babies do not have any problems with food proteins.For many fussy and gassy babies, the gassiness and fussiness can be due to other reasons, not always related to what food a mother has eaten.Written by Anna Burbidge for La Leche League GB, March 2019Further readinghttps://laleche.org.uk/breastmilk-and-the-environment/https://laleche.org.uk/too-much-milk-and-oversupply/https://laleche.org.uk/health-professionals/fat-content-breastmilk-faqs/https://www.llli.org/feeding-the-new-mother/https://laleche.org.uk/allergies/https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/allergies/https://laleche.org.uk/health-professionals/fat-content-breastmilk-faqs/https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/vitamin-d/https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/vitamins-nutritional-supplements/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-and-rickets/References[i]Sheri Lyn Parpia Khan.

"What is a “late preterm” baby?Late preterm babies are usually defined as those born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation.  Because these babies are often well – most don’t need to spend time in Special Care – and because they look like full-term babies (just a bit smaller), it’s often assumed that they will breastfeed easily from the start.Babies born before 37 weeks gestation are treated as premature.  Most late preterm babies do very well when they are born and, if they don’t need extra support with breathing, will usually stay with you.  Your baby’s doctor will want your baby monitored closely over the next few days to ensure his temperature is fine, his blood sugars are in the normal range, he doesn’t need treatment for jaundice and that he is feeding well.The following information may also be helpful if your baby was born at “early term” (37-39 weeks) but was small for gestational age, especially if under 2500g. It may also be helpful if your baby was born earlier than 34 weeks but is now at or after term age and still needs help with feeding.Small/early babies can be tricky to feed at firstSmall babies – those born early and/or small for their gestational age – can be tricky to feed at first, and it’s helpful to be aware of this.  They are sometimes known as “the Great Pretenders”, because they may spend a lot of time looking like they are feeding, but are not actually taking much milk!  This is because, even when well positioned and deeply attached at the breast, and encouraged to feed as often and long as they want, they often just don’t have enough energy yet to take what they need from the breast.  If they could, they would!Giving birth earlyGiving birth to your baby early, especially if you weren’t expecting it, can be a shock. You might feel worried about looking after a small, early baby, and confused about what to expect, even if you’ve had a baby before.  Doctors may be more involved in your baby’s care than if they had been born at term, and you might feel as if others are making decisions about your baby’s care which can be difficult to understand.  Knowing about the special challenges of feeding these babies can help you to make sense of what is going on.  Staff may be important partners in your baby’s care, but you, as the parents, are the most important people to your baby, so don’t be afraid to ask questions and make your wishes and feelings known.Some families know their baby or babies will be born early.  You may have a condition which means it will be safer to give birth earlier, and have opted for an early induction of labour or a caesarean birth.   Sometimes a placental problem is identified or the baby isn’t growing well and an early delivery may be the best option.Antenatal expression of colostrumIncreasingly, mothers who know in advance that their babies will be born early are choosing to hand express colostrum (first milk) before their baby is born.  Your body makes colostrum from as early as 16 weeks of pregnancy and with a little practice, you can learn to express (gently squeeze out) some of it, to keep until your baby needs it.  It is usually recommended to start doing this at 36 weeks, but if you know that your baby is going to be born before this, you can discuss with your healthcare team whether it might be helpful in your situation, and if so, when to start.Colostrum is usually yellow or orange in colour and known as “liquid gold” because it is so valuable for protecting your baby from infection and kick-starting their immature immune system.  Any farmer will tell you that baby animals who get their mother’s colostrum do better than those who don’t!  Expressed drops of colostrum can be frozen at home and brought into hospital at the time of birth.  As well as having colostrum on hand should your baby need it, expressing before birth helps you get to know your breasts and to practise hand expression, so if you are separated from your baby, or they are slow to get going with breastfeeding, you will have a head start on expressing colostrum after birth.You can find more information about expressing antenatally here:https://laleche.org.uk/antenatal-expression-of-colostrum/andhttps://laleche.org.uk/hand-expression-of-breastmilk/Skin to skin contactHolding your baby “skin to skin” (dressed just in a nappy, against your bare skin) has many benefits for all babies, but even more for late preterm babies.  Ask hospital staff to help you and your baby enjoy skin to skin contact as soon as possible after birth; you will soon become confident about how to get yourself and your baby comfortable.  The warmth of your body will help your baby stay warm and they will be calm and relaxed, saving their energy for feeding.  Late premature babies are usually sleepy and you may only get a short “window” of alertness before they fall asleep again.  While your baby is held against your chest you will get to know them and notice their subtle feeding cues as they move about, bobbing their head, licking their lips. You can gently help them move towards your breast and perhaps express some drops of colostrum onto your nipples for them to lick off.  They may latch on and have a little suckle.  Exploring your body and your breasts is an important part of your baby’s learning to breastfeed.  If they aren’t quite ready to begin breastfeeding yet, there’s no rush to make them start.  If your baby can breastfeed at all, even if they aren’t getting many calories from feeding yet, it can still be comforting and provide pain relief.  You may be able to feed them through medical procedures such as having a cannula put in – your medical team may be surprised how little your baby cries, if you work with them to find ways of doing this!Encouraging your baby to feedHaving a late preterm baby can be frustrating at times.  Although they might look like a slightly smaller version of a full-term baby, you can see that their prematurity affects the way they breastfeed.   Because they are immature,it is normal for their feeds to be sleepy and short, and for you to need to encourage them to wake and feed.In the early months,most babies need to feed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours, with at least 5-20 minutes of active sucking per breast (deep sucks, with swallows after every 1-2 sucks for most of the feed).  If your baby is too sleepy to do this much feeding yet, or if there are any signs that your baby might not be getting enough milk (fewer dirty nappies, more weight loss or slower weight gain than expected), it’simportant to act quicklyto keep your baby safely fed and to protect your milk supply.  You can read more about how to tell if your baby is getting enough milk athttps://laleche.org.uk/is-my-baby-getting-enough-milk/andhttps://laleche.org.uk/whats-in-a-nappy/Some babies need extra milk at firstIn the very early days, before your milk supply increases rapidly, and if they aren’t feeding vigorously yet, they may need more milk than the small quantities of colostrum you can express at this time.  Depending on the hospital, there may be donor milk available or your baby’s doctor may suggest infant formula for a short time until your milk supply increases.  In the early days and weeks after birth it is important to remove as much milk from your breasts as possible, as often as you can, to give your body a strong signal to make plenty of milk later.  Staff will support you to hand express at first (usually for about 3-4 days) and then to use a breast pump.   Make sure you know where and how you can rent or buy a breast pump for when you get home.You can read more abouthow to use extra milk(expressed milk, donor milk or formula) to support breastfeeding here:https://laleche.org.uk/formula-supplements/Growing into breastfeedingAs the days go by and they get closer to their due date, you will notice your baby getting better at breastfeeding.  Their feeds are longer, their sucking feels stronger, they wake by themselves and tells you when they are hungry.  You will start to find that they don’t want so much extra milk (and you may be able to express less), because they are taking more milk at the breast now. Keep closely in touch with your midwife or health visitor to ensure that as they take less extra milk, they continue to grow well.  It’s really tempting to stop expressing as soon as your baby is feeding better, but it’s wise to be cautious at this stage, and to reduce expressing and extra milk feeds gradually, while keeping a close eye on your baby’s nappies and growth.Nipple shieldsRecent research has suggested that some late preterm babies drink more milk when using a siliconenipple shield. The firm shield seems to help the baby with a weak suck to grasp and remove milk more effectively from the breast.  Not all late preterm babies will need a nipple shield, but they may be worth considering after day 4 or 5 if your baby is still very sleepy at the breast and their suck seems weak.  You can find more information here:https://laleche.org.uk/nipple-shields/.   You can talk to your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding supporter about whether this is a suitable option for you and your baby.Hard-wired to breastfeedParents sometimes worry that if their baby isn’t breastfeeding at all yet, or is breastfeeding but needs to use tools such as shields or bottles as well, that they will forget how to breastfeed.  You can be reassured that babies are strongly “hard-wired” to breastfeed, and will keep on trying for at least 8-12 weeks after birth.  You will notice that when your awake baby is placed face-down on your body, they start to move themselves around, as if they are looking for something.  If anything touches their head, they will turn towards it. They may smack their lips and suck their hands.  These are all feeding behaviours which are going to be useful to them in the months to come, and they won’t disappear for many weeks.Getting breastfeeding going matters but is it also very important to get your milk supply going!In the meantime, spending lots of time holding your baby skin to skin gives them lots of time to practise their feeding behaviours and to enjoy being near the breast.Balancing expressing and breastfeedingIf your early baby is spending a lot of time at the breast, it can feel as if there aren’t enough hours in the day to express milk.  Babies who aren’t feeding efficiently may spend most of their at-breast time sucking lightly (short, “fluttery” sucks, all the same length, with little or no swallowing) and complain when they are taken off the breast. Despite a lot of time spent “breastfeeding”, they don’t do as many dirty nappies as expected, or grow normally.  When this happens, it’s important to know what needs to be done first, so you can spend your time effectively.Removing milk efficiently from your breasts, to feed your baby and build your milk supply, is the first priority.  If your baby isn’t yet strong enough to do this themselves, you may need to limit their time at the breast for now, to free up enough time to express milk. Once you have a good milk supply, your baby has plenty of time to learn to breastfeed well when he is ready.How milk supply worksMilk supply usually reaches its peak level within the first month after birth, with most of this increase occurring in the first couple of weeks.  After this time, it tends to become more difficult to increase supply, and many mothers find it hard or even impossible to get more milk after about 4-6 weeks, however hard they work at it.  This is why it’s so important to start expressing early and often, if your goal is for your baby to be fully breastfed when he is ready.Some women do manage to get a significant supply increase later than this, though – you never know what you can do until you try!  If you’ve had aslow start with your milk supply, and are wondering if you can increase it, find good local breastfeeding support as soon as possible.Our article onhow milk production workshas more information you may find helpful.Here are some tips onmaximising your milk supply.For more information, please also see our article onincreasing your milk supply.Use your breasts as much as you can.More milk out = more milk made.  This is the main “rule” of milk supply, and much more important than any other factors, such as your diet, fluid intake, health or how unwell or tired you are (though of course you will feel better if you take good care of these things too!)  Milk removal doesn’t have to be doneregularly(with equal time gaps between), justas often as you can.While your baby is still small and tires quickly, it is likely that a breast pump is more effective than your baby at removing milk, so if you want to maximise your supply, it makes sense to prioritise expressing.  Aim to expressat least 8-12 times in 24 hours.  Expressing doesn’t need to be regular; do it whenever is convenient for you, even if this means expressing several times close together (babies often feed like this too!)  Try not to allow more than about 6 hours to go by without removing milk, though, since this causes your hormone levels to fall.The number of times per day you express is more important than the total time you express for,so if you only have a few minutes, it’s still worth it.  You can of course use any time left over for breastfeeding as much as you like!  Some mothers find that lining up 8-12 treats (e.g. chocolates or biscuits) each morning, and eating one each time they express, helps them to track how many times they are expressing, as well as rewarding them for doing it!  If you have a competitive streak, you might enjoy aiming each day to beat how much milk you expressed yesterday!Maximise efficiency at the breast.If there is any question about your baby’s effectiveness at the breast, skilled face to face breastfeeding support can help a lot.  Often, a bit of adjustment to how your baby comes to the breast can help to make the most of the time that he is feeding.  A slightly deeper attachment can make a big difference (and to your comfort as well, if you’ve had any pain or nipple damage).  However, even with comfortable, deep attachment, a small or early baby tends not to have enough energy  to remove all the milk they need, so just waiting until he grows a bit is likely to help a lot with their efficiency!  In the meantime,switch nursing and breast compressions,both described here:https://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-needs-more-milk/during feeds can help them to get more milk out in a shorter time.  Switching sides keeps the baby interested – flow is faster on the “new” side –  and compressions do some of the work for them.  As your milk supply increases, breastfeeding is going to become easier for your baby – he won’t have to work so hard to get milk out – another great reason to invest effort in milk expression at this stage!Use the most effective pump.For most women, this is a double electric “hospital grade” pump of the kind used in Special Care units, or the next size down.  Smaller (single electrics, or manual) pumps are designed for casual use, perhaps once or twice a day, rather than the big job of establishing a milk supply for a baby who can’t yet feed effectively.   Hospital grade pumps can be hired; your local LLL Leader may know of any pump agents in your area, or you can arrange hire online.Use “hands on pumping”.This is the most efficient technique that we know of, for getting the most milk in the shortest time.  How much you use your hands is probably even more important than what kind of pump you use, and whether you pump one or both breasts at a time.  “Double pumping” (both breasts at once) can be faster and more efficient, but some women find that it feels “too much” and prefer to express one breast at a time, using their hands to massage while they express.  You can find some great pumping ideas to try here:https://med.stanford.edu/newborns/professional-education/breastfeeding/maximizing-milk-production.html.  Hand expressing as much as you canafterpumping is probably the most important tip – the better you can drain the breast, the faster it will make milk.  A full hands-on expression session takes around 15-20 minutes, but it’s still worth expressing even if you don’t have more than a few minutes.Finish at the breast.Breastfeeding experts differ about exactly how to time formula or expressed milk supplements, but some say that theleasthelpful way to give them is always to offer themafterbreastfeeding.  This encourages dissatisfaction at the breast, and tends to undermine your confidence.  Supplements can either be given as a completelyseparatefeed (not offering the breast at all),orin themiddleof a breastfeed.  As long as the baby gets the right amount of milk in each 24 hour period, it really doesn’t matter exactly how it’s timed!  The goal is tofinish on the breastas often as possible.  It’s much nicer for your baby to feed off to sleep on the breast rather than the bottle, and for you to see them rolling off the breast looking full and happy!  Even if he isn’t breastfeeding at all yet, you can let them end their feed of expressed milk or formula milk with their cheek pillowed on your breast as they fall asleep.  A baby who enjoys being at the breast, and associates it with feeling satisfied, comfortable and happy, will be eager to breastfeed as soon as they are ready.Use feeding tools in ways that support breastfeeding.There are lots of ways to give your baby extra milk, if they need it.  Hospital staff may suggest that you feed extra milk by cup, or by nasogastric (NG) tube.  Sometimes, bottles are the most convenient way of giving extra milk.   Babies are hardwired to breastfeed, and once the underlying feeding issues have been addressed (or they have matured a bit more), they will usually happily begin or continue breastfeeding, whether or not they’ve needed alternative feeding methods.  Having said that, there are ways of using feeding tools that are more, and less, supportive of breastfeeding.  However you choose to give extra milk, feed carefully and slowly, paying attention to your baby’s signals, to keep feeding calm  for your baby and encourage behaviours that are useful at the breast.    You can read more about cup-feeding, “paced” bottle feeding, side-lying bottle-feeding and other ways of giving extra milk here:https://laleche.org.uk/bottles-and-other-tools/Consider domperidone.This is a prescription-only drug which has a side effect of increasing the levels of the hormone prolactin in your bloodstream.   It isn’t magic, but there is good evidence that for some women domperidone can help to boost milk supply, when combined with intensive milk removal as described above. If your GP is not familiar with its use for this purpose (and it isn’t licensed for this use, so your GP needs to be willing to take responsibility for prescribing it), these are useful resources to share:Breastfeeding Network – domperidone factsheetandUKMi – “Drug Treatment of Inadequate Lactation”.Get support from other mothers who value what you are trying to do. Any LLL group will welcome a mother who is working on her milk supply, and the other mothers will highly value the  effort you are putting in.    We warmly welcome anyone who is interested in breastfeeding or providing their own milk for their baby, whether or not they are currently breastfeeding – please don’t feel awkward about giving extra milk at a LLL meeting.  Many LLL groups are on Facebook too – it can be a great way to connect with other mothers whose babies have been born early, and who have overcome their early feeding challenges.See also:www.laleche.org.uk/how-to-increase-your-milk-supply/How much milk do I need to make?It might help to know that a week-old full-term baby takes about500ml in 24 hours, rising to an average of750ml in 24 hoursby 2-4 weeks after birth and staying at this level until the baby starts eating other foods, around 6 months.  Although every baby is different, with some babies needing more and some less milk than this, it can be helpful to have a rough idea in mind of how much milk to aim for when you’re expressing.  Even if your small baby doesn’t need this much milk yet, if your goal is to feed them only on your milk, it makes sense to aim for a full supply, so that you will have plenty of milk for them as they grow.Although formula instructions suggest increasing the amount in line with the baby’s weight (feeding a certain number of ml per kg of baby weight), human milk supply doesn’t work like this – the daily amount stays the same  from about 1-6 months, and this is probably a better guide.  If you can get to a full milk supply by the end of the first month, you’ll be making as much milk as your baby will ever need!Babies often go through a“catch up” phaseof drinking large volumes of milk and growing fast, until they catch up with their natural size.  You can tell when this happens, because their growth curve settles on one of the “centile lines” on the chart in the red book.  It is important to work closely with your health visiting team during this stage.  You will probably want to weigh your baby at least once a week until you and your healthcare team are confident that your baby is feeding well.If your baby has needed someformula supplements, you can find information on how to use and perhaps reduce them here:https://laleche.org.uk/formula-supplements/This is an art rather than a science, and it’s important to work with your local healthcare team and local feeding supporters with the skills and experience to work with late preterm babies.Early/small babies just need a little more time and supportWith time, and patience, this special group of babies can breastfeed beautifully – they just need some extra help at first, when they aren’t yet able to do all the work of feeding by themselves.  Knowing what to expect, being prepared for the extra investment of effort, and finding good breastfeeding support will help you to reach your breastfeeding goals.Key pointsIf you know your baby will be born early, consider expressing colostrum antenatally.This gives you a headstart with feeding your baby and learning how to express milk by hand.Keep your baby close.Holding your baby against your skin will keep them calm and happy, encourage them to feed, save their energy for feeding and help you to notice the small signs that he wants to feed (like smacking their lips and sucking their hands).  It’s the best way to get to know and enjoy each other.Keep your baby fed.Early/small babies might not ask to feed as often as they need to, and often tire quickly when feeding.  Your baby needs to be fed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours.  Short, frequent feeds usually work best.  Encourage them to feed whenever they show interest.  Watch your baby’s nappies and growth carefully to make sure he is getting enough milk.  Some babies may need extra milk (expressed mother’s milk, donor breastmilk or formula milk) at first.Keep your milk flowing.Milk supply usually reaches its peak level (around 750ml in 24 hours on average) within 4 weeks of birth.  Removing milk frequently in the early days and weeks gives your body a strong signal to make more milk.  If your baby can’t take all they needs  at the breast yet, express your milk with a pump and/or your hands, as often as you can, to keep your baby fed and ensure a good milk supply for when they are ready to breastfeed.Keep your goal in mind.Early/small babies will grow into breastfeeding, with time and patience.  Their path might be more complicated, and involve more people, tools and time than a full-term baby.  Get the support you need while you do some of the work of feeding for your baby, until they can do it all for themselves!Further

"My baby feeds all evening, and my breasts feel empty – have I run out of milk?Every time I try to put my baby down to sleep, they cry! What am I doing wrong?Why does my baby cry at the breast sometimes, even though they still seem hungry?If you’ve ever asked questions like this during the rollercoaster weeks of new parenthood, you’re in good company! Most new parents, unless they have been around newborn babies a lot before, are surprised and sometimes confused by how intensely their baby needs to be held and comforted. At times, it can feel like very hard work, or even as if, whatever you try, nothing quite works. Babies on the TV might sleep quietly in their beds between feeds, but real babies often don’t!Here is some information that may help you make sense of your baby’s behaviour and work out whether there is a problem that needs fixing, or whether your baby is just doing what normal babies do. If you haven’t had your baby yet, reading ahead can help prepare you for what to expect, so that you take this stage in your stride!This article about normal newborn behaviour assumes that your baby is full-term, healthy, feeding well and growing normally. If your baby was born early, is unwell, or if you are not sure whether your baby is feeding or growing well, please check with your midwife, health visitor, doctor or breastfeeding supporter.Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of signs that more could be going on than just normal newborn behaviour:your baby’s poo output is less than expected (What’s in a nappy);your baby loses more than 7% of birthweight by day 5 or keeps losing weight after day 5;your baby grows at an average of less than 20-30g per day after day 5;your baby doesn’t wake at least 8-12 times in 24 hours to feed;your baby seems to be in pain;your baby cries inconsolably for hours, even in your arms;your baby develops patches of dry skin/eczema or a wheeze;your baby has green/mucousy stools or blood in their stool;breastfeeding is painful for you and not getting any better;your baby is often unhappy or frustrated at the breast;your baby often feeds for more than 40 minutes per breast or doesn’t stop breastfeeding until you take them off the breast.If any of these apply to you, please seek further help from your healthcare provider or a breastfeeding supporter.“Fussy periods”When they aren’t feeding, many babies sleep most of the time during the first few days after birth. This may be nature’s way of letting both mother and baby recover from their birth experience.Around 10-14 days old, though, your baby may “wake up”, sometimes quite suddenly, and you may be shocked by the change! From now on, your baby will spend increasing amounts of time awake. At times, it can feel like hard work to make sense of what they need and to help them get back to sleep when they have had enough of being awake.Many young babies have a “fussy period” of a few hours each day, when they especially need lots of calming and soothing. This is most commonly, though not always, in the evening and first part of the night, and tends to build in intensity over the next few weeks. The peak age for crying is around 6-8 weeks.Why babies need so much help in the eveningMany pregnant women notice that their unborn baby seems most active when they lie down at bedtime. This could be because they have stopped walking around and lulling their baby back to sleep!It is common for newborn babies to continue this pattern of evening wakefulness during the first few weeks after birth. By about 6 weeks, most babies are learning that the night is for sleeping, and (though they may still need to feed at night for many months) will begin to settle to sleep more quickly after a feed. You can gently help your baby learn the difference between night and day by taking them out in the daylight, especially in the morning, and keeping the lights low at night.Another reason for babies to be unsettled by the end of the day is that their brains feel like they are on fire! Babies’ brains are growing amazingly fast – they double in size in the first year. Every day, they take on lots of new information and experiences, and by the evening they are so excited by the day’s learning that it takes them a long time to wind down towards sleep.In busy households, with other adults and children coming back at the end of the day, some babies may find all the extra activity overwhelming, too. And if it’s been just you and the baby all day, by the evening you may be feeling frazzled yourself, and in need of nurture and care, just like your baby! Unlike adults, babies can’t just “switch off” and relax; they need lots of help from calm, loving adults.Breastfeeding – more than just milkBreastfeeding provides babies with much more than just milk. A frazzled baby seeks the breast because the rhythm of sucking, the closeness and security of being held, and the feel and smell of their mother’s body help them to feel safe and calm.Most babies like to feed more often in the evening. Milk flow might be a bit slower than it is first thing in the morning, but this isn’t a problem; it means that babies can do lots of calming, soothing sucking at the breast without getting uncomfortably full. If your baby cries when you offer the breast yet again, it won’t be because the breast suddenly doesn’t work! It’s much more likely that they’ve just had enough for the moment. The signals for “I’m hungry” are very similar to “I’m bored/tired/sad/uncomfortable/need a cuddle”. Your baby still needs help, they just don’t want the breast again right now.You can find some ideas below of other ways to soothe a frazzled baby. If you’re not sure what your baby wants, try offering the breast first, but if it seems to make things worse, try something else, and offer again when they are calmer.The “fourth trimester”Some experts talk about the “fourth trimester” of pregnancy; the first few months after birth, when babies’ brains are still in an “unfinished” state. Human babies have to be born while their brains are still relatively immature, in order to fit through their mother’s upright, restricted pelvis.Your baby will learn to calm down and manage their own emotions when they are ready, but a young baby can’t do this yet. You don’t need to be worried that, by giving them the help they need now, they will be “clingy”, “spoiled” or more dependent later. In fact, the opposite is true. Psychologists know that babies whose needs are met promptly early on are more likely to develop into trusting, confident children, because they find the world to be a safe place and know that they can always find help if they need it.In the early months, if you are managing to keep your baby safe, fed, comfortable and reasonably happy, you are doing a great job.A typical evening with a newbornYou feed your baby until they look fast asleep. You carefully put them down in their bed. Either immediately or soon afterwards they wake up and cry. You think they must be hungry… maybe breastfeeding isn’t working? You feed them again until you think they can’t possibly fit in any more milk, and put them down…. and so on, until the early hours of the morning.Although (especially if you haven’t breastfed before) you may worry that your baby cries at the breast because there’s a problem with feeding, as long as the signs of milk intake (weight, wet & dirty nappies) are OK (What’s in a nappyandMy Baby needs more milk) , and your baby is happier the rest of the time, it’s probably nothing to do with hunger, or a breastfeeding malfunction! Your baby is most likely to have woken up because they were put down.The conditions that adults might prefer for sleep – quiet, dark, being left alone – are scary for babies, who fear being abandoned more than anything. For our ancestors, a baby who was left alone was a baby who probably wouldn’t survive. Your baby has an “alarm”, carefully developed over thousands of years of human evolution, that is programmed to go off if they sense that they have been left alone.What can you do about it?Here are some ideas you might like to try:Babies, like other small primates, feel safest held closely against an adult body, especially an adult who is moving around. Try swaying or gently dancing with your baby.If you want to put your baby down, try to help them feel they are still with you: warm their bed, put something in it that smells of you, rock the crib, leave your hand resting on them while they fall asleep, etc.Wait about 20 minutes until they are in deep sleep before putting them down. If you put them down too soon, they are more likely to wake up, perhaps quite upset, because they wanted to be asleep.Carrying your baby in your arms or a sling meets most of the same needs as breastfeeding, and can be done by another adult. Dads or other close care-taking adults are oftenbrilliant at this. A baby who is not hungry will still head towards a milky breast if they smell it close by. If they really don’t want to nurse again, they might protest when they get there, which can be confusing for everyone!You don’t need to put your baby down if you don’t want to.If you do want to, enlist the support of other people who can get to know and love your baby. If you don’t have another adult living with you, could a family member or friend come and stay for a while? Do you have an older neighbour who misses their grandchildren? A teenager who is brilliant with babies? Even very young babies can have close relationships with several adults (and older children) at once, and another pair of arms can be helpful to both you and your baby at the end of a long day.Try going outside – babies are often happier outdoors.Babies often seem more relaxed when you are surrounded by other adults; they know the sabre-toothed tiger can’t get them! Visiting a pub garden can work really well on summer evenings. If you are at home and don’t have company, try the radio or TV on a channel with people talking.Experiment with singing, dancing, music, massage, bathing, rocking, walking.Try turning the lights and the noise down. Some babies are more sensitive to lights and noise than others.If you can do so safely, (Safe sleep and the breastfed baby) you might want to experiment with sharing a bed with your baby. Learning to feed lying down in a safely prepared bed means that you won’t have to move your baby once they are asleep, and you can get some rest while you feed. If you are worried about whether your baby will be safe in bed with you, you might want to try it in the daytime first, with another adult keeping an eye on both of you.Make sure you get something to eat (prepare a meal/snack in advance) and get a nap or at least a rest earlier in the day if you can, to prepare for the time of day when your baby needs you the most.Sometimes nothing works; you can still let your baby know you are there with them in their distress.If your baby is crying as if they are in pain, check with your doctor. There is more information here about possible reasons for crying. (Unhappy baby)If you feel overwhelmed by your baby’s needs, get help & support. Looking after a crying baby is really hard, but much harder if you feel unsupported. Your midwife, health visitor, GP or a parent support group can all help.Although attending a La Leche League meeting will not guarantee you more sleep, knowing that this phase is normal and will pass can really help. Other mothers who have experienced the intensity of the early weeks with a baby will welcome and encourage you. Many LLL groups offer support on Facebook too. (Find a group)You are working enormously hard to understand and meet your baby’s needs. Every baby is different, and you are becoming an expert on your baby. There is no “right” or “wrong” way to be with your baby (any more than there is a right or wrong way to be with a partner or friend); there is only what works for you both, today.This can feel scary at first (if only babies came with an instruction manual!), but as time goes on, you will feel able to try different ideas for calming your baby, and come up with some new ones. As the weeks go by, you will learn more about what helps your baby (and what doesn’t!) and become more confident about knowing when they are OK, and when to get help. As your baby gets older and more experienced, they will find the world, and their own bodily sensations, less alarming.These early weeks, which can feel like “forever”, will pass. Before you know it, you will be able to support a newer parent who is wondering how on earth they will get through it, because you did!Written by Jayne Joyce, on behalf of LLLGB, January 2019",https://laleche.org.uk/fussy-evenings-with-a-newborn/,“Fussy evenings” with a newborn
"Feeding breastmilk other than at the breastWhen the nursing mother and baby are separated or the baby cannot feed at the breast, they may need another way of taking breastmilk.These tips assume that your baby is being fed expressed breastmilk. If this is not available, please check with your baby’s healthcare provider.When is the best time to introduce a bottle?La Leche League’s manualThe Womanly Art of Breastfeedingsuggests that unless it’s essential, ideally the introduction of a bottle is left until the baby is at least three to four weeks old, and breastfeeding well. Milk supply can adjust to the baby’s needs more easily if they are able to breastfeed directly, and the more practice the baby gets at the breast, the more quickly they will become skilled at breastfeeding.Some people worry that if they don’t introduce a bottle early on, the baby won’t take one later. While a younger baby is slightly more likely to accept a bottle than an older one, it’s not a strong effect. Most babies of all ages will accept a bottle – some with a little coaxing!If you are thinking ahead to going back to work or study, but you won’t be doing this until your baby is older than six months, it may be reassuring to know that your baby probably won’t need a bottle by then. They will already be eating other foods and drinking water, and could be offered milk in their usual cup. Healthcare providers recommend that by a year, all babies (even those who have been completely bottle-fed) have stopped using bottles, because of their impact on teeth.When a baby isn’t able to breastfeed at all, or isn’t able to take enough milk at the breast, it’s important to start expressing milk early and often, to protect your milk supply and keep your baby safely fed. You can find information about this here:https://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-wont-breastfeed/https://laleche.org.uk/expressing-your-milk/https://laleche.org.uk/hand-expression-of-breastmilk/Ideas for introducing a bottle to a breastfed babyIf you would like to introduce a bottle, here are some ideas that have worked for other families:Choose a time when your baby is happy and relaxed, and not too hungry. It’s difficult to learn a new skill when you’re hungry! It can be helpful at first to think of it as a play activity, rather than a meal.Have someone else offer the bottle to your baby.A breastfed baby may be least likely to accept a bottle from his mother – they knows where they expect the milk to come from! This doesn’t mean that they won’t accept an alternative when she isn’t available. Even very young babies understand that different people care for them in different ways. Often, the best person to give a bottle to a reluctant baby is an experienced, confident bottle-feeder. Ideally, this will be someone who knows the baby well. Limit the number of people feeding your baby to no more than two or three; feeding is an intimate process, and it’s important that your baby feels safe and comfortable, and that the feeder can get to know your baby’s preferences.Hold the baby comfortably, but not lying in the crook of your arm.Babies who are bottle-fed lying on their backs can end up taking too much milk, too quickly. Very young babies (under about six weeks) can be fed lying on their side, on a pillow on your lap, with their feet towards you. Some younger babies, and most older babies feed best sitting up fairly straight, supported behind their neck and shoulders by your arm or hand.Gently present the bottle teat across the baby’s lips, to stimulate their gaping (mouth-opening) reflex and invite them to take the teat into their mouth. You could gently tickle their lips with it, as many mothers do with the breast. If they accept it, give them a good mouthful, so they aren’t just sucking on the end of the teat. Most babies do best with a teat that encourages them to open their mouth wide.Keep the bottle in a horizontal (flat) position,so the baby needs to suck actively to get the milk, as they do at the breast. This is often called “paced bottle feeding.” You will need to tip the bottle as it becomes emptier, so that there is milk at the end of the teat, but the whole teat doesn’t need to be full of milk all the way through the feed. Most babies do best with a slow-flow “newborn” teat; you might need to try a few different brands and teats to find one with a speed your baby likes (flow rate is not standardised across different brands). It typically takes about 15-20 minutes to finish a bottle – there’s no rush. Tilting the bottle to pour milk into the baby’s mouth can lead to them taking more milk than they need, faster than they can easily manage. This can cause discomfort, as well as frustration when he returns to the breast and the flow of milk is slower.Watch for signs that the baby needs a break.When breastfeeding, the baby waits for a few seconds up to a minute before the milk “ejects” in a rush, then gradually slows down, allowing natural pauses. Bottle-feeding can be tiring for the baby, because they have to keep sucking at the same speed throughout the feed. The following signs suggest they might need a rest: a wrinkled forehead (frown); wide, alarmed eyes as they gulp quickly; “starfish hands” (fingers splayed out); turning their head away from the bottle; suddenly going to sleep (not just gently drifting off as they become full and satisfied). If you notice any of these stress signals, or if milk spills from theirmouth, tip the bottle down to stop the flow, or take the bottle away, until she asks for more milk. If she doesn’t ask for more, she has had enough for now.As at the breast, babies may wanta feed that comes in two parts.Young babies may want a short nap (often about 10-20 minutes) before taking the second part of their feed. Most adults prefer always to give a bottle using the same hand, but you could even try turning them round to have some more on the “other side”!Alternatives to bottlesMost breastfed babies in the world never use a bottle, going straight from the breast to drinking from a cup. And a few babies who are offered a bottle simply refuse to take one, whatever their parents and carers try! Bottles are not the only alternative feeding method – there are lots of other options.Even premature babies can drink from anopen cup, with care and practice. Special cups are available, but any clean cup can work; some parents prefer a small one, such as a shot glass.To cup feed:Sit your awake baby upright on your lap, supported behind her neck and shoulders by your arm or hand.Place the rim of the cup on their lower lip and tilt the cup until the milk approaches their lip. Their tongue will explore and find the liquid. Thet will then lap or sip the milk – on the first few attempts, this may take a few minutes. You might want to use a bib or cloth to catch spills, until you’ve got some experience of feeding this way! Don’t pour the milk into your baby’s mouth. Keep the level constantly by their lower lip and allow them to rest and pause while drinking, but do not remove the cup.When they have finished, they will let you know by turning their head away, or by other obvious cues.To learn how to cup feed, try practising with another adult first – you will quickly work out how far you need to tip the liquid to avoid frustration or spills!Other feeding methods:For a tiny baby, other options for offering milk include a dropper, oral syringe or teaspoon.A baby who can breastfeed but needs extra milk as well could be fed using a nursing supplementer – a gadget that delivers milk via a tube that is taped or held next to your nipple. The baby takes both breast and tube at the same time, and gets milk from the supplementer as he nurses at the breast. Your LLL Leader can help you decide whether this might be a suitable option for you.You can find information about this here:https://laleche.org.uk/nursing-supplementers/Babies who can sit up may prefer to feed themselves (well supervised) from a regular cup or a “sippy cup” with a lid. If you are also breastfeeding, you may want to avoid models that rely on the baby biting or pressing firmly on a valve to get liquid out.Your baby may enjoy drinking milk from something he often sees you using, such as your favourite coffee mug – just make sure you wash the coffee out first!When your baby is fed by one of these methods, be sure to breastfeed often when you are together, to satisfy your baby’s sucking need.How much milk?Most breastfed babies take about 60-120ml (2-4oz) of breastmilk per feed, from 1-6 months of life. The composition of breastmilk changes as the baby grows, but not the quantity.This is different from artificial milk, which the manufacturers suggest needs to be given in increasing volume, in line with the baby’s weight as he grows. Some experts think that this leads to overfeeding, and may be one of the reasons why babies fed on formula milk are at higher risk of overweight and obesity in later life.If you are feeding carefully, in a “paced” way (as described above), you can trust your baby to show you how much they want at each feed. It may be a quick drink or a full meal – just like adults, babies don’t need all their feeds to be the same size.Make sure that the alternative caregiver doesn’t give your baby a lot of milk shortly before you return, though; you will probably want to feed as soon as you arrive, to reconnect with your baby and relieve your breasts!Changing feeding patterns when mother and baby are apartIt’s common for breastfed babies to refuse a bottle initially when their mother returns to work or study, while they adjust to major changes such as a new daycare environment and caregivers. Adults often feel less hungry when they first start a new job, too! The baby’s appetite will come back as they settle into their new rhythm and gets to know theircarers.Some babies may choose to “reverse cycle,” which means refusing a bottle or taking less milk than normal when away from mum, then nursing a lot when they are together. Breastfeeding isn’t just about milk, of course; allow your baby to “fill up” on cuddles, as well as milk, as much as possible when you are together. Give yourselves a week or two to adjust to your new pattern. As long as your baby’s nappy output and growth are normal, he’s getting enough milk.Babies older than about six months, who are also eating other foods, may choose to manage without milk altogether while you are away, managing fine with food and water until you get back. Babies often surprise their mothers by eating much more when you aren’t there than they do at home, especially if other children are also eating!When other people want to bottle-feed your babyOften family members sometimes express a desire to bottle-feed a breastfed baby as a way of “bonding” with them. They may be impressed by the powerful connection you are making with your breastfeeding baby, and want the same kind of closeness.It can be helpful to know that what strengthens attachment is touch (especially skin-to-skin holding) and gaze (looking into each other’s eyes) – not the transfer of milk. Fathers, co-parents and other key adults who spend lots of time holding babies skin-to-skin and sharing gaze and smiles with them experience a surge of nurturing hormones, like breastfeeding mothers do. If you want to promote a closer connection between your baby and the other important people in her life, encourage them to wear her in a sling, take a bath with her or just hang out together between breastfeeds, and let nature do its magic!Even very young breastfeeding babies can have strong, loving relationships with several people at once, including other close adults and siblings. Their mother is usually the centre of the baby’s universe, and especially if they are tired, upset or unwell, there will be times when “only mum will do”.Fathers and other close adults can feel frustrated and powerless, and wonder whether life might be easier for them if the baby weren’t breastfed. Experienced parents know that these early months and years pass quickly, and the time will come when the baby or young child reaches out to someone else, in preference to their mother! Older babies and toddlers typically go through cycles of intense connection with one favoured parent or carer, then another.In the meantime, there are many ways a loved one can help you and your baby at the same time.They can love, listen to and support the breastfeeding parent.They can change a nappy.They can bathe the baby.They can hold and calm the baby when he is not hungry, especially in those evening hours when young babies often need long periods of intensive soothing.They can “babywear” and spend time skin-to-skin.They can play with, sing and read to the baby.They can bring mum a glass of water, snack, phone, TV remote, or anything else she needs when she sits down to nurse.They can take care of housework, errands and meals.They can defend mum when others may not support breastfeeding or other parenting choices.They can be right there next to mum when she breastfeeds in public, helping her feel confident.They can contact a La Leche League Leader for help!Bottles are not a necessary part of a close relationship with the baby.Differences between feeding at the breast and being bottle-fedExclusive pumping (“EP”), when a baby is fed completely on his mother’s expressed breastmilk, is becoming more popular, for many reasons. Most mothers who express all their milk for their baby have experienced such overwhelming breastfeeding challenges that breastfeeding directly does not feel like an option for them. They invest precious time in milk expression so that their babies can still have the benefits of mother’s milk. This is a true “labour of love”.A few mothers may have the option of breastfeeding directly, but wonder whether expressing their milk and feeding by bottle isn’t just as good. It may be helpful to know that there are some differences between direct breastfeeding and “breastmilk feeding” by other means.Your milk has the highest level of antibodies when your baby takes it directly from your breast, and next highest when it is freshly expressed. Your body responds to your baby’s saliva – if your baby is exposed to something that he needs antibodies for, this need is communicated to your body as your baby breastfeeds.The longer milk is stored, the more the active components are deactivated. Your refrigerated or frozen milk still provides excellent nutrition and protection for your baby, just not as good as directly from the breast or freshly expressed.The activity of breastfeeding helpsexercise the baby’s facial muscles.This promotes the development of strong jaws and balanced facial structure. Several studies have shown breastfeeding to enhance speech development and speech clarity.iiiiiiIncreasing duration of breastfeeding is associated with decreasing risk of later need for braces or other orthodontic treatment. One study showed that young children with a history of suboptimal breastfeeding have a higher prevalence and risk ratio for malocclusions.ivother studies suggestbreastfeeding could reduce childhood stutteringBreastfeeding directly is alsoless time consuming– as any EP mother can tell you! There are no pump parts to wash, a skilled breastfeeding baby can remove milk faster than any pump, and the mother doesn’t need to spend extra time pumping and then feeding the expressed milk to her baby. When the baby is hungry or needs to be comforted, you simply put your baby to the breast, without needing to prepare the bottle and warm the milk.The benefits of skin-to-skin contactSkin-to-skincontact provides a baby with huge benefits. It increases the mother’s milk supply by helping her hormones to flow, and helps to “organise” the baby’s behaviour so that he learns to feed more easily. Babies who are held skin-to-skin cry less, saving their energy for growing, and have more stable breathing, heart rate, blood sugar, and temperature.When you are breastfeeding, you have to be in skin-to-skin contact with your baby, even if you don’t feel like it! And a baby at the breast is at the perfect distance for gazing at your face, basking in the warmth of your smile. When a baby is fed partly or entirely by bottle (or any means other than the breast), they can still benefit from lots of skin contact, holding and gaze – carers just need to be more intentional about it.Your baby might enjoy:Taking a bottle snuggled against your bare breastFalling asleep with their cheek pillowed on your breast at the end of a feed (some babies may be willing to use the breast to suck themselves peacefully off to sleep after a bottle-feed, even if they get most of their calories by bottle)Taking a bath with youBeing “worn” in a sling or front carrier near the breastLa Leche League is all about mothering – not just breastfeeding. While we believe that “mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural and effective way of understanding and satisfying the needs of the baby”, we know that when this isn’t an option, or can only be done some of the time, with care and thought, babies can be fed and mothered lovingly and responsively in other ways too. We have supported thousands of mothers to provide breastmilk for their babies by means other than the breast, and to have a wonderfully close, satisfying relationships with their babies. You can too!La Leche League groups welcome anyone who is pregnant, breastfeeding or providing their own milk for a baby, or trying to do so. Please don’t feel awkward about feeding your baby from a bottle or other means during a LLL meeting, or asking questions about it! Breastfeeding mothers understand better than anyone else the challenges of breastfeeding, and the work involved in expressing milk. We would love to meet you and your baby, and support you on your feeding journey.Originally published by La Leche League International in January 2019 and available athttps://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/bottles/You can see a poster about cup feedingherei Broad, F.E.

"If you are breastfeeding during pregnancy, you may be wondering what happens after your new baby is born. Nursing a new baby while an older one is still nursing is generally referred to as tandem nursing. This could be after a pregnancy and the arrival of a new baby or having adopted a new nursling while continuing to feed your older child.Thinking about tandem nursing will likely involve considering and weighing up many variables. As a breastfeeding mother, you are aware ofhow important nursing is to your relationship with your older child. Deciding whether to continue breastfeeding him along with a new nursling or to wean him deserves careful consideration of both of your changing needs.Many mothers find making this decision particularly difficult. You may be drawn to both options at different times. Taking one day at a time may be helpful if you are unsure of what to do. Getting support in making your decision will give you confidence that you are doing what is best for you and your child.If you do decide to tandem nurse, you are not alone! Many mothers have tandem nursed two, or even three, children and found that it works for their family. Children who have been tandem nursed often continue to have a special bond throughout life, and mothers report that tandem nursing can help to ease the transition of having a new baby in the family.Why tandem nurse?Continuing to breastfeed your toddler through the stressful and highly emotional experience of gaining a sibling can help to make the transition smoother for them. They are less likely to be jealous of the baby who is allowed to breastfeed if they can nurse alongside them. The nutrition and immunological properties of breastmilk continue to be valuable and they can help your toddler through any illness, tantrums and fussy phases (“regressions”), which can sometimes occur. Nursing your older child once the new baby arrives can ease engorgement when your milk becomes plentiful and helps protect milk production if your baby is not feeding effectively.Breastfeeding during pregnancyBreastfeeding during pregnancy is a special experience for both you and your nursling and recent research on the safety of nursing during pregnancy shows that there is usually no reason for concern (you can read more about thishere). Your breastfeeding relationship may change throughout pregnancy to accommodate both your developing needs and the needs of your child. Around the fourth or fifth month (sometimes before), pregnancy hormones will probably cause your milk supply to reduce and its composition and taste to change. These changes may cause some children to nurse less or wean completely (you can read more about thishere).Nursing whilst pregnant continues to meet your child’s nutritional and emotional needs and it can be an opportunity for you to savour your unique relationship with your older child, before your baby joins the family. However, it can also be a challenging time for you and it may invoke intense feelings. Getting support at this time may be very beneficial, and you may find talking to an LLL Leader or going to your local LLL meeting really helpful. OurPregnant and breastfeeding?article has more information.Preparing yourself and your toddler for a new babyAdding a new baby to the family has a big impact, no matter if it’s your second, or your tenth! Children, particularly younger ones, may not feel emotionally ready to accept this big change easily. It is a good idea to prepare your toddler and any older children by talking about a new baby coming. Reading stories together and showing them pictures of babies nursing can help them to be more accepting when their sibling arrives.Many mothers find that they don’t receive the same offers of support during second or subsequent babies as they did for their first. It is important to remember that as a mother nursing two children (or more), any support given will allow you to focus on mothering your new family. Try to get plenty of rest and eat well before the new baby comes. Actively preparing your support network before your baby arrives will make the transition easier for you all. LLL groups are a great place to meet like-minded mothers whose support can transform your mothering journey.Labour and birth – tandem styleYou may be wondering how you will be able to provide for your older child during labour and whether she will be able to nurse or not. Having a dedicated caregiver for your older child who is able to give her expressed milk (if necessary) and get her to sleep will allow you peace of mind if you are unable to provide for her during labour.You may want to think about whether to have your older child with you during labour and birth or soon after the new baby arrives. If you are planning a hospital birth, you can inquire about access for your toddler and inform your medical team that you will want your toddler to be present during or soon after the birth. Some nursing mothers opt for a home birth, which usually allows more freedom for your older child to be included whenever you want her too.Breastfeeding releases oxytocin and can help to progress a slow labour. However, many mothers prefer to focus on the act of birthing and choose not to have their older child with them until the new baby has arrived.Your baby’s first breastfeed is a really special time. If your older child breastfeeds at the same time, this special moment will be part of their memories too.Any stitches you have had from a tear, episiotomy, or C-section will need to heal and you may find positioning your baby, older child or both challenging and may need a helping hand.Premature birth or complicationsWhen a baby arrives early or there are birth complications, it can be a really difficult and stressful time, which often involves a hospital stay and being separated from your older child. Although your newborn will need to take priority, trying to have your toddler for short visits whenever possible can be really helpful. If your newborn is unable to nurse right away, your older child can continue nursing and protect your milk production.The early days – what to expectWhen you give birth your body will continue to produce colostrum, with milk becoming plentiful after around 3-5 days. As with your previous baby, you will need to nurse at least 8-12 times per day to establish your milk production. You may worry about your newborn not getting enough colostrum if your older child is feeding too. Some mothers feed their newborn baby first or encourage the older sibling to nurse less if they feel their baby is not feeding enough. Look out for feeding cues and give your baby unrestricted access to your breasts to help ensure he gets plenty of milk. The more milk is removed, the more will be produced. Feeding cues to watch for include rapid eye movement, moving hands, squirming or rooting.Good positioning and a deep attachmentat the breast will help your newborn feed effectively. Encourage your baby to finish one breast before switching to the other.If you are expressing milk for your baby, your toddler’s nursing will help your supply.Hands-on expressingwhile your toddler is nursing may be particularly effective.See our pageIs My Baby Getting Enough Milkfor further information.Toddler nursing like a newborn?You may find that once your baby arrives your toddler starts nursing frequently again, just like your baby. Older siblings may enjoy increased milk supply, or simply be thinking about breastfeeding more as they see the baby breastfeeding often.If your toddler does increase his milk intake, he may lose interest in solid foods for a while as he enjoys your newly increased milk production. He may have looser stools.If you are happy to nurse your toddler as much as he wants, it can be a lovely bonding experience for the three of you. However, if you are feeling overwhelmed by his requests or not keen on nursing so frequently, you might like to try negotiating with your toddler about when and for how long he is allowed to breastfeed. See ‘Feelings’ section for more ideas.Separately or together?You may prefer nursing your baby and your toddler separately or breastfeeding both nurslings together. Your older child can access your breast in many creative ways!It can take a while before your body adapts to the needs of two different nurslings. Sometimes you may feel lopsided if one breast has been drained more than the other. Eventually things will settle down and you’ll have your own individual rhythm. Alternating breasts for each feed helps with development of newborn vision and keeps the size of your breasts balanced. However, some mums find that giving a toddler his ‘own side’ works for them.Tandem nursing positionsJust as with nursing one child, there are many different tandem nursing positions you can use which are comfortable and allow for milk to be removed effectively. You may need to experiment to find out what works for you when feeding two nurslings at the same time. Your older child might also have strong opinions about how she likes to nurse!If you plan to tandem feed out of the house, it might be worthwhile practising a few positions at home first, so you know you can get both nurslings on and off easily. Some mothers find it easier to position the baby first and let the toddler climb on, while others prefer to position the toddler first and then add the baby.Double cradle holdYour toddler is positioned curled around or underneath your baby, with each child’s head supported by your arms.Double underarm (clutch or rugby) holdYour toddler sits or semi-reclines with legs pointed away from you. Your baby is held underarm with his feet away from you. This position is good for protecting caesarean stitches or if your toddler sometimes kicks or disturbs your baby.Double side-lying holdYour toddler is positioned laying down next to you, then the baby is perched on top of your toddler.There are many other variations and combinations of the above positions which you can try.For more information about feeding positions for a single baby, see Positioning and Attachment.Fast flowWith each pregnancy your body makes more milk and an abundant milk supply/forceful let-down can be challenging for your newborn. Your older child might oblige and deal with the fast flow; otherwise, expressing just a little milk into a towel until the flow eases may help your newborn.FeelingsTandem nursing is a big commitment and emotions can run high at times. You may experience huge highs, deep lows, find it too demanding, and think it is magical, all within a short space of time. It can feel as if it will be this way forever, but it might be helpful to remember that babies are small for a short period of time and the dynamics between you and your two (or more) nurslings will soon change. Having realistic expectations about what you can manage at this point in time can be helpful.As a tandem nursing mother, you and your breasts are a focal point for nourishment and care for both of your nurslings. This can feel overwhelming and at times you may feel breastfeeding aversion or agitation. This can manifest itself in feeling ‘touched out’ and having the urge to limit your toddler’s nursing. Your reaction may be mild or quite severe with strong urges to stop feeding your older child.Many mothers report that the nursing agitation they feel is not an accurate reflection of their feelings about breastfeeding or their relationship with their toddler. In this case it may be helpful to do some detective work about why you may be feeling like this. You might realise that you are unwell, need more rest, are not eating well, are stressed about something, or are experiencing a bit of mother burnout. Prioritising self-care and having some time alone can really help to rebalance your mind and recharge. Carving out time for yourself, even if it is only 10 minutes, can give you the strength to manage. Taking time to rest is also important, and you can try to take advantage of daytime opportunities for a nap.If you want to put some limits on your toddler’s nursing, you might like to try negotiating with your toddler about when he is allowed to breastfeed, setting gentle limits about the length of his feeds by counting or singing, or pre-emptively offering snacks or playing games with him.Finding support from other tandem nursing mothers gives you an opportunity to talk things through with someone else. LLL meetings are a great place to meet tandem nursing mothers.Looking after yourselfWhen tandem feeding, you may be constantly thirsty, hungry and tired. It’s important to look after yourself by taking every opportunity to rest together and by eating plenty of nutritious snacks and meals. Feeding both children at the same time during the day is a great opportunity to try putting your feet up and relaxing. Accepting offers of help with shopping, housework and cooking from family and friends can be extremely helpful. Taking a few moments to nurture yourself can help avoid feelings of stress or exhaustion.Self-care is an essential part of mothering, particularly when your body is undergoing such large changes and ongoing demands.Try to make your needs clear to your partner/support person, as they will be better able to help you if they know what you need. Trying to keep expectations realistic reduces stress for you and the rest of the family. Particularly in the early days, your priority is looking after your new baby and older child(ren), so be kind to yourself.Eating for ThreeTandem nursing puts physical demands on your body as you produce enough milk to nourish two children. Fatigue can be a warning sign that you are not keeping up with your calorie intake requirements. It is a good idea to drink to thirst and eat as normal using your appetite as a guide.NighttimesManaging bedtimes with two nurslings can be a bit tricky. If you plan to breastfeed both children to sleep you might find you can feed both simultaneously lying down, then move one child once asleep. Or it might work better to have someone else available to hold/entertain one child while you nurse the other to sleep, then nurse the second child to sleep afterwards.It is possible to nurse both children during the night, but you may need to do some experimenting and find out which positions work for you. See ourSafe Sleep and the Breastfed Babyarticle for more information on safe sleeping practices.You may choose to night wean your toddler, but this might result in considerable effort and sleep-loss in the short term during the weaning period. It is helpful to consider whether night-weaning will lead to more sleep for you or if it will be more disruptive. If you do decide to night-wean, it can be helpful to have someone else put the toddler to sleep and go to them if they wake during the night.Becoming a big brother or sisterChildren react in many different ways to the birth of their new sibling. It is common for children to find it difficult to adjust to a new family member. As a tandem nursing mother, you may find that nursing your toddler (with or without baby) offers a welcome sanctuary from the stresses of the new family dynamic. Tandem nursing siblings often have an added bond as children and can have a special relationship throughout their lives.Occupying your toddler while your baby is nursingKeeping your toddler occupied while breastfeeding your baby may be a challenge you have not faced before. It can work well to set clear expectations about breastfeeding, so your older child understands what he is allowed to do during nursing time. Some older children react well if you give them a warning before you start breastfeeding your baby. It might also work well if you feed your baby in a sling, so your older child may not even notice your baby is nursing.Here are some ideas to occupy your toddler while you are nursing your baby:Have a special “breastfeeding toy box” which is only brought out when you are nursing your babyEnsure your toddler has got a snack and drink prepared beforehand to eat while you are nursingShare a book and a cuddle with your toddler while nursing your babyPlay verbal games with your toddler, for example “I spy”Ask your toddler to help you out, for example bringing you a nappy, a muslin etc.A time for weaningFor some mothers tandem nursing continues for quite a while. Others decide that weaning an older child and nurturing their relationship in a different way works better for them. If you decide to stop breastfeeding your older child, keep in mind that it may be a gradual process and one which needs gentle encouragement and patience.OurThinking of Weaning?article has information on weaning strategies. Talking to an LLL Leader can help you decide what is going to be best for your family.Adopting a second nurslingChoosing to breastfeed your adopted baby is a wonderful way of bonding with her. As a mother who is already nursing another child, you are in the good position of already having a milk supply flowing. You will probably need to increase your supply to cater to your new baby’s needs. See our article onRelactation and Induced Lactationfor more information on how to increase your supply and how to supplement your baby if needed.Tandem nursing your adopted baby and your toddler can create a special bond between all three of you which could last for life. However, breastfeeding your adopted baby may be challenging and you will benefit from a strong support network. Your local LLL meetings can be a great place to find this support.Written by Bronwyn Davies, LLL West Kent, July 2018Further ReadingBirth and BreastfeedingIs my baby getting enough milk?Dealing with criticismNipple PainPregnant and Breastfeeding?Relactation and Induced lactationSafe Sleep & The Breastfed BabyStill nursing?Thinking of Weaning?Toddlers and FoodWhen you don’t enjoy BreastfeedingSinkiewicz-Darol E, Bernatowicz-Łojko U, Łubiech K, Adamczyk I, Twarużek M, Baranowska B, Skowron K, Spatz DL.

"Breastfeeding may not always be easy at first, but as the months go by many mothers find it is an important and enjoyable part of their relationship with their child, one neither of them is ready to bring to an end quickly. However, society is not always accepting or understanding of mothers nursing older children and women can find themselves under pressure from others who feel breastfeeding beyond infancy will be in some way detrimental.Sometimes mothers worry that they need to stop breastfeeding and have a number of questions and concerns about “full-term” breastfeeding and the criticisms they face. This article addresses some of them.At what age “should” a baby be weaned?There is no definite age at which a baby will wean: just as with other areas of development, there is a wide range. Some babies will need the comfort of breastfeeding much longer than others and ideally nursing will continue until both mother and baby feel the time is right to wean. This can’t always happen and sometimes a mother needs to wean earlier, but if the nursing dyad is happy, there is no reason to stop.Historically, until relatively recently, “extended” – or to better describe it “full-term” – breastfeeding was the cultural norm. According to anthropologist Kathy Dettwyler, in societies where children are allowed to nurse as long as they want, self-weaning usually happens between 3 and 4 years of age. Her research on breastfeeding duration in non-human primates (based on a number of variables such as length of gestation, weight gain, age at sexual maturity and dental eruption) places the natural duration of breastfeeding in modern humans between 2.5 and 7 years.For example, Dr. Dettwyler explains how, according to one study, weaning in non-human primates’ offspring happened when they had reached about one third of their adult weight, which happens in humans at about 5-7 years.  An analysis of weaning age and sexual maturity in non-human primates also suggests a weaning age of 6-7 years for humans (about half-way to reproductive maturity).[i]Dr. Dettwyler also says:“Many primates wean their offspring when they are erupting their first permanent molars. This occurs around five-and-a-half to six years in modern humans around the same time as achievement of adult immune competence suggesting that throughout our recent evolutionary past the active immunities provided by breastmilk were normally available to the child until about this age.”[ii]Is it harmful to continue to breastfeed?On the contrary, breastfeeding continues to provide comfort, security and protection against illness for as long as it continues.The American Academy of Pediatrics states that increased duration of breastfeeding confers significant health and developmental benefits for the child and mother.[iii]These extend well beyond the period of breastfeeding and there is evidence that the longer a baby is breastfed the greater the protection from ill health and the more positive the impact on long-term health for both mother and baby.[iv]The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine states: “Claims that breastfeeding beyond infancy is harmful to mother or infant have absolutely no medical or scientific basis.”[v]Can prolonged breastfeeding cause infertility?As a baby grows older, he usually starts nursing less or having longer breaks between feeds and this often coincides with the mother’s own recovery from birth. A high-need or fragile child may nurse more frequently, and this can contribute to temporary infertility which ensures the baby is fully ready for a sibling.Fertility usually returns around the time periods return, so if they haven’t returned and a mother is ready to for another pregnancy she may want to consider cutting out night nursing or having longer breaks between feeds. This will often kick-start fertility. An older toddler is unlikely to be feeding two-hourly.A short luteal phase – from the day after ovulation until a period starts – can affect fertility. This is associated with high levels of prolactin and a doctor might be able to prescribe progesterone supplements to correct this.[vi]If a mother needs to take fertility medications, there is usually no need to wean because most are safe for breastfeeding.  Although treatment may be less effective, it’s a personal decision to weigh up a baby’s need for breastfeeding against the wish to have another baby right away.[vii]Suckling has become painfulBabies are usually pretty good at adjusting their latch as they grow and their teeth come through, and many babies never bite.  Sometimes they need to learn how to adjust the way they nurse and if they occasionally forget, there are suggestions which can help. A baby can’t bite while actively sucking.Sometimes mothers find they have sore nipples when they are feeding an older baby and there may be many causes for this – a chipped tooth, food sensitivities or a gymnastic nursing baby! Sore nipples at this stage tend to heal quickly once the cause is found and it’s possible to chat to a baby of this age, explaining it hurts and asking her to be gentle.[viii]Am I making my child too dependent on me?It’s a common misconception that nursing an older child makes him less independent; we know of no evidence to support the comments that breastfeeding an older child leads to over-dependence on the mother.It’s not possible to force a child to be independent before he is ready. In fact independence, not dependence, is one outstanding trait that breastfed children who self-wean have in common.[ix]Natural weaning reflects differences in children and it’s a natural process for children to outgrow breastfeeding on their own, at their own pace. When a child weans gradually he feels emotionally attached to his mother for his comfort and security. Many weaned toddlers and pre-schoolers continue to have a need to suck for comfort, as shown by the continued use of a dummy or thumb, as well as the attachment to an inanimate object like a cuddly toy or a blanket.Breastfeeding provides feelings of love, comfort, and protection. When a mother is there to nurse her child through a situation that he can’t handle alone, he will likely develop independence based on faith that his mother will be there to help.[x]Allowing a child to nurse (or wean) at his own pace is an expression of trust that contributes to his self-esteem.[xi]Breastfeeding mothers benefit from being near their children, and children love the comfort and security that comes from being close to their mothers.Mothers are sometimes told they will “spoil” their children by responding to them but in fact it’s been found that when mothers respond to their children they are less likely to cry.[xii]When babies are small their “wants and needs” are the same thing.  As a child grows he can’t always tell the difference between what he wants and what he needs, but knowing his mother is there for him helps him feel secure and to learn with kindness how to respond.[xiii]I’d like a bit of time to myselfMothers of young children are often urged to separate from them and being “too attached” is sometimes seen as a negative. Strong attachment to a parent is a normal need that is part of children’s development.[xiv]It is perfectly normal for children to like being close to their mother; they will grow to be independent by feeling secure, not through forced separation.Over the past few decades, many eminent child psychologists have found that children thrived better if parents acknowledged their offspring’s feelings and understood the need for attachment. Communicating with children about how they feel has been found to lead to a better relationship than an authoritarian approach.[xv]English psychiatrist Dr. John Bowlby developed the concept of “attachment theory” according to which a warm, close, enjoyable and continuous relationship with a child’s mother (or permanent mother-substitute) has a positive effect on a child’s well being.[xvi]Older nurslings are usually able to cope well with their mother doing other things and to understand how their relationship works, because they know they feel secure. There is no reason why a mother can’t have some time to herself while still enjoying their breastfeeding relationship.If a mother returns to paid work her older nursling is usually able to adapt well to being away from her, in the knowledge that when they are both home again he will have the comfort of breastfeeding. Mothers enjoy that special reconnection too.You can read more about separation here:https://laleche.org.uk/when-mum-cant-be-there/Doesn’t my child need to learn to “self-soothe”?It is interesting that the term “self-soothe” is so often used as something children need to learn, when it was actually a word invented in the 1970s during research undertaken by Dr. Thomas Anders of the University of California, Davis Medical Center. He used it to describe children who went to sleep on their own after waking, as a contrast with babies who cried when they woke up. He called this “signaling”. He wasn’t trying to say self-soothing was something to aim for, but the description has come to be adopted as a fact rather than a research term, with far more meaning than was intended.When a child is left to cry himself to sleep, there is no way of knowing if, when they stop crying, they have fallen asleep or have simply gone into a “withdrawn” state where they have given up hope of being responded to. While babies may indeed stop crying if left unattended long enough, they are not learning to “self-soothe”, they are simply giving up on the hope that comfort will come.It’s acknowledged that adults in relationships enjoy being close to each other and sleeping in the same bed. It is comforting to wake in the night and feel the presence of someone we love next to us.  This raises the question of why babies or children should be expected to sleep alone, left to cry and “self-soothe” when adults aren’t.Will still breastfeeding mean he won’t eat enough solid food?Nearly all babies can make the gradual adjustment to eating solid food without any trauma, while continuing with the comfort of breastfeeding. Mothers are sometimes told that the longer they breastfeed, the harder it will be to transition their child to solid foods. We know of no evidence to support this, as most babies will be ready for solids sometime after six months of age. Just because a baby continues to breastfeed doesn’t mean he isn’t eating other food too. Breastfeeding a toddler is very different from nursing a newborn.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends mothers worldwide to exclusively breastfeed infants for the first six months of their life in order to achieve optimal growth, development and health. It also recommends that infants continue to be breastfed for at least two years, and as long as mutually desired, while being given nutritious complementary foods.[xviii]Can prolonged breastfeeding cause malnutrition and low energy?The physiological process of weaning is complex and involves microbiological, biochemical, nutritional, immunological, and psychological adjustments for both mother and child.[xix]Most importantly, during the weaning process the composition of human milk adjusts to meet the needs of the growing child so that, although the volume is decreasing, an appropriate level of nutrients remains present and immunological protection is not compromised.[xx][xxi]If an older child is being offered a variety of healthy foods alongside breastfeeding, there is usually no cause for any concern. It’s often overestimated how much food a young child needs, and children who have stopped breastfeeding can also have small appetites. There is some evidence to show that breastfeeding might protect against obesity by helping a child to better regulate their food intake.[xxii]Breastmilk is also invaluable when an older child is unwell and can’t take solid foods.I’m ready to stop but my child isn’tThere are often ebbs and flows in a breastfeeding relationship.  Sometimes older children can have times of intense need when, after having reduced how much they nurse, they suddenly seem to want to breastfeed a lot; sometimes mothers can feel overwhelmed by this and ready to stop nursing.  If this happens, it is worth thinking about anything which might have unsettled the child – such as a change in family life, a move, more hours spent at nursery – and trying to meet the increased need for a while. Children often sense when their mother is no longer happy with the nursing relationship and this can make them feel insecure and even more interested in breastfeeding.It can seem like life would be much easier without nursing, but it’s important to remember that even after weaning, your child will still need to be comforted, may still wake up at night, and will still need a lot of attention. Having a bit of time to yourself doing something you enjoy (like taking a bath, reading a book, going to an exercise class or taking a walk) while a trusted friend or family member plays with your child can be really helpful.Spending time with like-minded mothers who understand how you feel and support you in your choices can make a big difference.  Filling up our own “emotional reservoir” is very important to be able to meet the needs of our children.Nursing is a relationship between two people and if it no longer feels right to you and you really want to stop breastfeeding, there are lots of gentle ways to wean your child. For example, some mothers choose to wean during the day but still nurse at night, or vice versa. Older children are surprisingly good at understanding and adapting to new nursing routines.You can find lots of ideas about gentle weaning here:https://laleche.org.uk/thinking-of-weaning/I’m pregnant, do I need to stop breastfeeding?Very rarely does a mother need to wean her child to maintain a pregnancy.  With uncomplicated pregnancies, there is no need to wean and nursing will not harm the growing foetus.[xxiii]Women are sometimes told that the release of oxytocin during breastfeeding will stimulate uterine contractions resulting in early labour. However, oxytocin can be released for other reasons (such as orgasm and extreme happiness) which women aren’t cautioned against.It’s not unusual for nursing mothers to feel some nipple tenderness or pain during early pregnancy. Later on, it’s very common for mothers to feel impatient when nursing their older child, also because a drop in their milk supply may make it uncomfortable to feed. This seems to be nature’s way of putting the new baby first, even though nursing doesn’t have any harmful effects on the growing foetus.[xxiv]Whether to wean or not is a very individual decision. Some mothers decide to overcome any discomfort because they know nursing is so important to their child, particularly if he’s still young; others feel it is better to gradually wean. Some mothers wean during pregnancy, but  start nursing the older child again after the baby is born. The “don’t offer, don’t refuse” weaning method is a good way to assess if a child is ready to wean. Some older children choose to wean as they lose interest due to the lack of milk or change in its taste.A useful book on this subject isAdventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding during Pregnancy and Beyondby Hilary Flowers.[xxv]The Australian Breastfeeding Association booklet on Breastfeeding through Pregnancy and Beyond is also helpful.[xxvi]You can find more information on this topic here:https://laleche.org.uk/pregnant-and-breastfeeding/What if my child starts asking “awkward questions” about nursing?Sometimes mothers are told that if a child is old enough to ask to breastfeed then they are too old to do it.  However, many mothers find nursing a child who is old enough to articulate a source of great joy. It can be a cause of happiness and contentment for both.  Older nurslings often make both amusing and heart-warming comments about their need to breastfeed.  Many a mother has got to the end of a difficult day and then sat down and nursed her child and been overwhelmed with love for her little one.  It’s a great way to relax for both of you.If they can ask, they can also understand that it might not always be appropriate to nurse.  Many older babies are happy to nurse at home for quick “comfort stops”, unlike a younger child who needs to nurse straight away.  Even if a toddler is so distressed that he needs to nurse quickly, mothers are great at finding ways to do this while out and about. It can be useful to have a family name for nursing that a child can use when out that allows for discreet toddler nursing if desired.The sexualisation of breasts in today’s society can mean that mothers are sometimes warned that continued nursing might have future consequences for older nurslings, such as overstimulated sexual feelings. Sometimes mothers worry if their little boy has an erection when he is nursing. This is perfectly normal, can also happen during cuddling and can be ignored. Responding warmly to a child’s needs will add to his future security, not harm him.[xxvii]Other people’s criticism is hard to cope withIt can be hard to deal with negativity and criticism from others, especially well-meaning relatives. A lack of understanding about why a child might continue to breastfeed can lead to people, even strangers, making hurtful and misinformed comments.It can be especially hard if a partner no longer feels comfortable with an older child breastfeeding. Sometimes, when children are walking and talking and still nurse, partners worry that they may be too dependent on you.It can help to listen to how your partner feels and to talk about why nursing is still important for you and your child, explaining how breastmilk is still nutritious, protects from illness and gives comfort and security.   What seems like a long time now, will only be a short part of the childhood years. Sometimes it can be helpful for partners to talk to others whose children have nursed for longer, or to see children who have fed for a long time and are now outgoing and independent.You can read more about dealing with criticism here:https://laleche.org.uk/dealing-with-criticism/Acceptance and supportIdeally, how long to breastfeed will be a mutual choice for each mother and baby. However, in order to breastfeed for as long as they intend, women need accurate information and appropriate help, as we work towards creating a society which accepts and supports breastfeeding as the norm for as long each mother-baby dyad wishes to continue.Finding like-minded mothers, knowing you are not alone, that you are doing the right thing for you and your child and feeling supported in that choice, can make all the difference.  It can give a mother the confidence to listen to the needs of her own child and not feel pressured by a society which may have different expectations as to how babies and toddlers behave.  La Leche League group meetings are great places to find mothers who understand why some children breastfeed for longer than others.You can find your nearest LLL group here:https://laleche.org.uk/find-lll-support-group/Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, April 2018Further reading: Mothering Your Nursing Toddler by Norma Jane BumgarnerReferences:[i]Dettwyler, K.A Natural Age of Weaning.http://whale.to/a/dettwyler.html(accessed 8 February 2018).[ii]Dettwyler, K.

"When a baby cries for a long time without any obvious cause parents are often told their infant has colic. This is a “catchall” description for when a baby cries incessantly for around three hours a day and cannot be comforted. The crying generally happens in the afternoon or evenings. It often starts in the early weeks and usually stops by about four months.It can be extremely distressing for a mother to listen to her baby crying without knowing what is wrong or what to do to comfort her child. It’s easy to start to wonder if breastfeeding is to blame, particularly if others suggest it might be.What causes colic?Sometimes the cause of colic is never uncovered and may be related to the baby’s own personality or temperament. Some babies are more sensitive than others and need more comforting. It’s not unusual for a baby to cluster feed in the evening both for comfort and to increase milk production, and crying which is labelled as “colic” may simply mean that the baby needs to nurse again.For other babies, the discomfort can be traced to overabundant supply of milk, overactive letdown, reflux or occasionally allergies. Sometimes a baby is still feeling discomfort from the birth process.Positioning and attachmentColic-type symptoms can appear if a baby is having problems latching onto the breast. A shallow latch can lead to babies taking in a lot of air which then causes discomfort. The birth process can sometimes leave babies with tension in their jaw and neck, which makes it hard for them to open their mouth wide enough.This article gives a lot of suggestions on how to encourage a deeper latch and finding a position which may be more comfortable.https://laleche.org.uk/positioning-attachment/Tongue-tie can also cause difficulties with latching and positioning and can be distressing for both mother and baby.  You can find more information in this article:https://laleche.org.uk/tongue-tie/OversupplyThe baby may be gaining weight well,but seems fussy at the breast. She may pull off the breast spluttering and a mother may see a forceful milk flow. The baby cries and wants to nurse,but seems angry and arches away. Her poo may be green and frothy, rather than yellow, and she seems windy and unhappy.This articleexplains the causes of oversupply and gives a lot of suggestions on how to improve things.RefluxReflux and colic are closely related and are often confused. Reflux can also be caused by oversupply and both are more often a problem when a baby is given large feeds with long gaps in between. A baby who has reflux often spits up milk and cries more when he is lying down or is in a car seat.This articletalks about identifying reflux and offers ideas to help.AllergiesMothers with a fussy baby often wonder if something in their diet is to blame. Some cultures whose diet includes spicy foods have a special, milder diet for nursing mothers for the first month or so. Most babies are not bothered by any foods their mother eats, but if a baby comes from a family with allergies and seems fussy, it can help to keep a food diary just to see if any particular food triggers discomfort.There is more on allergieshere.Culture-Induced Colic?One study by Ronald Barr, a paediatrician at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, looked at infant crying patterns.[i] It suggested that some crying is normal, but it may be prolonged by modern practices such as longer intervals between feedings. Dr. Barr compared the results of a study on the !Kung of South Africa[ii] with the typical ways in which American and European infants are handled and fed. The !Kung carry their babies with them constantly and feed them whenever they cry. Babies may be fed three or four times an hour for a minute or two at each feeding.Dr. Barr asked some mothers to carry their babies for at least three hours a day and these mothers reported that their babies cried only half as long as babies who were not carried for the extra three hours.What can I do for my unhappy baby?Many fussy babies are more settled if they are kept close to their mother and can nurse whenever they need to. Offering the breast calms many a crying infant, especially if his mother has been trying to limit feeds because of sore nipples or to try to space nursing.If that doesn’t work, then just holding him and carrying him may help. Especially for babies with reflux, being held upright is much more comfortable than lying down. All babies have wind and many aren’t particularly bothered by it, but if it is making him uncomfortable an upright position can help move gas bubbles that are causing him pain.A useful phrase is “contact, carry, walk and talk”: research has shown that these steps, used in a sequence as needed, can significantly reduce crying in many babies.Many mothers have found the following ideas mentioned inThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding[iii] helpful:Respond right away. If a baby is picked up and comforted before he gets too distressed it is usually easier to calm him.Try to use a soft baby carrier as much as possible. A baby likes to be close to his mother and being upright is often more comfortable. It is easier to respond when he needs to feed. Going out for a walk may be relaxing for you both.Try the Magic Baby Hold/colic hold (pictured). This can be a really helpful calming technique, especially for a well-fed but fussy baby. The baby is held with his back against his mother’s chest so both are facing forward. Mother’s left arm goes over the baby’s left shoulder and holds his right thigh. The baby will have one arm either side of his mother’s arm and his mum will have a solid grip on his leg. He can face the floor or be hugged against his mother so he faces outwards or even with mother’s hand (still holding his thigh) on her hip. Mum has her shoulders relaxed, and a hand free if needed. In this position the baby is also on his left side, which some babies find more soothing.The “baby bounce” can be added to this hold. It can start with simple swaying, then adding a “hitch”. Although the baby’s face is not visible, it’s possible to feel his body’s tension, so if the back of his head starts to wrinkle or his body starts to tense the next things is to turn just a bit so he sees something different. Mostly the baby bounce and change of scene will help.Burp her.Change her nappy.Undress her completely – her clothes may be causing her discomfort.Swaddle her in a light blanket.If she is overstimulated, take her to a quiet room.Rock her.Sing to her, talk to her, or make loud “shh” noises while keeping her in your arms.Try different positions such as laying her on her tummy and rubbing her back, or carrying her tummy down across your forearm.If the baby is being fussy at night and it feels like you are the only ones awake in the whole world, it might help to go outside or look out the window at the moon and think about all the other mothers and babies out there under the same moon.A nice relaxing bath together can calm both mother and baby, and some babies who are refusing to nurse will naturally latch on in the warm water.Some babies like a gentle massage (there is one called the “I love U” massage in The Fussy Baby Book by William and Martha Sears).Go out and about or run errands during the baby’s fussy time to entertain him.Dance with him.Put the baby in a sling or blanket “hammock” and swing him gently either head-to-toe or ear-to-ear.Chiropractic adjustments have been suggested to alleviate colic in some babies.[iv]If he really wants to nurse, nothing will help but nursing!Is anything helping?When a baby cries non-stop and it’s hard to comfort him, it’s easy for a mother to feel she is doing something wrong. She may start to think she doesn’t know how to mother her own child or even that he is doing it on purpose. Well-meaning friends may suggest the baby is manipulating his mother, but babies aren’t capable of this. They don’t understand why they are in pain and just want the comfort of their mother’s arms.If he continues crying even when held, it can seem to a mother that she is not helping her baby, but it is never a waste of time to cuddle him. In fact, a baby needs his mother more than ever at this time. Even if he doesn’t know why he is unhappy, having his mother close helps him feel safe and loved.Finding support from othersLooking after a crying baby can be exhausting and stressful. If it gets to the point where a mother feels at her wits’ end, it can help to ask someone else to hold him for a short time while she takes a break and makes a hot drink or has a snack. If she is on her own and really feels like it is too much, then lying him down somewhere safe, just for a few minutes while she goes to another room and takes a few deep breaths, can restore her ability to comfort her little one.[v]It’s sometimes suggested that a baby be left to “cry it out”, but prolonged crying is physically and emotionally very stressful and may have an impact on the wiring of the brain.[vi] If left, a baby will stop crying eventually but learns that her needs for comfort have not been taken seriously. Responding to a baby’s cries builds security and independence in the future.[vii]You can read more about the risks of letting babies cry here:https://laleche.org.uk/letting-babies-cry-facts-behind-studies/Mothers of crying babies need a lot of emotional and practical support. It is tough having a constantly crying baby but it does end. Lots of fussy newborns grow into relaxed, happy six-month olds. While it is ongoing it can help to find a circle of friends you can complain to. At LLL meetings mothers will be able to empathise, offer suggestions and encouragement during this challenging part of motherhood.You can find more information here:https://laleche.org.uk/unhappy-baby/Recommended reading:The Fussy Baby Book by William Sears and Martha SearsColic Solved: The Essential Guide to Infant Reflux and the Care of Your Crying, Difficult-To- Soothe Baby by Bryan VartabedianThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, 8th Edition, by La Leche League InternationalWritten on behalf of La Leche League GB by Anna Burbidge, March 2018.Referencesi Barr, RG et al.

"Many women plan to return to paid work in the months following the birth of a baby, either through choice or necessity. Knowing your rights and planning ahead can help you continue to breastfeed after your return.What are the options?• If a woman has worked for an employer for at least 26 weeks she can request flexible working hours, asking for changes to her days, hours or place of work.• She can ask for shorter shifts, to work part-time or move from evening/night shifts to day in order to continue breastfeeding.• The employer is legally required to give the request serious consideration and can only refuse for good business reasons.• This could be a temporary change in contract while she is breastfeeding.• It may be possible to work from home for all or some of the time or even bring the baby to work.Planning ahead• It’s a good idea for women to make a flexible working request at least two months before returning from maternity leave, or to discuss this option during pregnancy.• Sorting out breastfeeding breaks at least three weeks before returning to work will allow for adjustments in routine.• It is indirect sex discrimination for an employer to refuse a flexible working request from a breastfeeding mother if there are not good business reasons for the refusal, and if it results in the mother stopping breastfeeding.• It’s important to tell an employer about the need to express milk at work. Breastfeeding/expressing breaks in the workplace are not a statutory requirement, but the Equality Act 2010 considers failing to assess or take action on health and safety risks for a breastfeeding woman as sex discrimination. Providing employees with breaks to breastfeed or express may reduce health risks, such as that of developing mastitis.• Employers are required by law to provide a breastfeeding mother with a place to rest, and this could be used as a room to breastfeed or express. The provision of washing facilities and a clean secure fridge to store milk are recommended.• Providing breastfeeding or expressing breaks has positive results for both employer and employee. Women who feel their employer is supportive are more likely to return to work and have higher morale, productivity and overall satisfaction.Finding support and informationYou can find more practical help and suggestions here:Working and breastfeedingWorkday practicalitiesWhen mum can’t be thereIf you leave your babyAccommodating Breastfeeding on Return to WorkMaternity Action has published a leaflet for employers entitled Accommodating breastfeeding on return to work and it also provides information for mothers on continuing to breastfeed when returning to paid work .Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, March 2018Further readingMaternity Action.

"At the moment many women face difficult choices after they have had a baby.  They may have agreed to return to work when their baby is six or nine months old, and while that can seem a long way off before the birth, LLLGB has found that many women feel it comes round all too quickly. While they are enjoying breastfeeding and want to continue, many mothers feel concerned about how they will manage when they go back to paid work.Some mothers feel they are committed to returning to work and that they have no choice but to wean their babies. Breastfeeding breaks and flexible working hours could make all the difference to them.  There can also be considerable pressure on women to go back to paid work even though they would love to be at home for longer and this is an area where women also deserve support.How employers can support breastfeeding womenIn February 2014 La Leche League GB (LLLGB) reported on a new guide for employers on breastfeeding breaks in the workplace, produced by ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service).[i]Representatives from LLLGB, along with other breastfeeding organisations, provided input for this guide and they have since then continued to work with Maternity Action to develop further resources.Maternity Action subsequently produced a leaflet for employers entitledAccommodating breastfeeding on return to work.[ii]Although Parliament has still not legislated to make breastfeeding/expressing breaks in the workplace a statutory requirement, employers must meet obligations to breastfeeding employees under Health and Safety Law, Flexible Working Law and Discrimination Law.Assessing RisksWhile the law does not require employers to conduct an individual risk assessment for a breastfeeding mother, they must assess risks to new and expectant mothers arising from working conditions. They must take reasonable action to remove or reduce risks, and providing employees with breaks to breastfeed or express can be part of this effort.Employers are required by law to provide a breastfeeding mother with a place to rest, which could also be used as a room to breastfeed or express. It is also recommended that employers provide washing facilities and a clean secure fridge to store milk.Flexible Working RequestsIf a woman has worked for an employer for at least 26 weeks she can make a request for flexible working hours.  She can ask for changes to her days, hours or place of work, or to work shorter shifts, to work part-time or move from evening or night shifts to day in order to continue breastfeeding.The employer is legally required to give the request serious consideration and can only refuse for good business reasons. The employer and employee can agree to a temporary change in contract while she is breastfeeding.Planning aheadIt is good practice for an employer to have a policy on breastfeeding setting out how employees can make requests and how these would be considered.  It’s also a good idea for women to make a flexible working request at least two to three months before returning from maternity leave, or to start discussing options during pregnancy.  Sorting out breastfeeding breaks at least three weeks before the woman returns to work will help to adjust her breastfeeding routine.Equality Act 2010Under the Equality Act 2010 it is sex discrimination to fail to assess or take action on health and safety risks for a breastfeeding woman where the work could involve risks with serious consequences for mother or baby.It is also sex discrimination to harass a breastfeeding employee or to fail to take action to stop other staff members from harassing her.  This can include jokes and banter.It is indirect sex discrimination under the Equality Act for an employer to refuse a flexible working request from a breastfeeding mother if there are not good business reasons for the refusal, and if it results in the mother stopping breastfeeding.Positive resultsProviding breastfeeding or expressing breaks has positive results for both employer and employee. It has been shown that breastfed babies are sick less often than formula fed babies, so parents take fewer days off.  The Maternity Action leaflet says that parents of breastfed babies have one-third the absences of parents of formula fed babies. This saves companies money.The leaflet states that women who felt their employer was supportive were more likely to return to work, saving in recruitment costs and lost output from staff turnover.Employees working in companies which accommodate breastfeeding have also been found to have higher morale, higher productivity and overall satisfaction.Information from LLLGBYou can find more information about working and breastfeeding here:Working and breastfeedingWorkday practicalitiesWhen mum can’t be thereIf you leave your babyWhat legal rights do breastfeeding mothers have when returning to paid employment?You may also be interested in reading the bookWorking and Breastfeeding Made Simple[iii]by LLL Leader Nancy Mohrbacher.Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, February 2018Notes[i]Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.Accommodating breastfeeding employees in the workplace.October 2013;http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/2/i/Acas-guide-on-accommodating-breastfeeding-in-the-workplace.pdf(accessed on 2 March 2018).[ii]Maternity Action.Accommodating breastfeeding on return to work.https://www.maternityaction.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/BORTW-employer-leaflet-FINAL.pdf(accessed 2 March 2018).[iii]Nancy Mohrbacher.

"Sometimes breastfeeding doesn’t go as hoped for, or as expected. Some of those mothers, with a little support, guidance and practice, quickly move to a place of comfort and enjoyment and they don’t look back as they overcome challenges. But some don’t. Some of them need incredible determination to overcome problems and difficulties. Some go far beyond what even they thought they would do. And some reach a point where they run out of energy and emotion to keep going.What do they need from those around them?How can partners, family, friends or health professionals support them in a way that helps those who are discovering that breastfeeding isn’t going as well as they expected? Here are five areas for supporters to consider:1. Help her find the right supportUnicef has shown that eight out of 10 women stop breastfeeding before they want to. And that “For breastfeeding to work, you need someone to turn to who believes it’s important and believes you can do it.”[1] And that means helping her find a qualified, informed breastfeeding supporter; for example, an LLL Leader or other breastfeeding counsellor[2] or IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant).The first step is almost always to explore what’s happening with breastfeeding – not suggest alternatives. The cliché ‘Breastfeeding problems have breastfeeding solutions’ has great value. It’s saying that even if additional solutions are needed to overcome problems and meet the baby’s needs, the first step is to look at what’s going on with breastfeeding. Finding someone for her who can offer breastfeeding expertise and knowledge, and who will look at the mother and baby as a unit, might be the biggest act of support you can give her and the baby.Care and concern come from a good place. Of course no-one wants to see someone they love or care about struggling or distressed. And no-one, least of all the baby’s mother, wants to see a baby do anything but thrive. The first rule is always feed the baby. And helping her to find the right support to do that is the best help – to help her achieve her breastfeeding goals or make the decision to change those goals.2. Listen to herMothers and parents are already facing a society and culture where bottle-feeding is seen as the norm. By the time a baby arrives, their parents will have already been bombarded with adverts and images of the best bottles and formulas. Mothers talk about pressure to breastfeed – and also about pressure NOT to breastfeed. It can already feel like swimming against the tide for anyone who WANTS to breastfeed, even with a supportive partner.And so supporters have a huge role in helping a mother to focus on what she wants to do. Sometimes mothers will say they can’t talk to their family about difficulties anymore because they just say, out of care for her, “you’ve done so well, you could stop now”. And some say they are told that “You know you don’t have to breastfeed”. But what if she wants to?Instead, supporters can ask her what she wants to happen? Where would she like to get to with her baby? What are her goals and ideals for feeding her baby? Without knowing the answer to what she wants, those around might offer the mother solutions that don’t help her and in fact make her feel more isolated. Just like those around her, her priority will be to make sure her baby’s needs are met – she’s not breastfeeding ‘just for herself’.Sometimes someone’s reasons for struggling aren’t obvious but are deep-rooted, perhaps she is finding it hard because of hidden issues or historical experiences around her body and breasts and how she feels about herself or her body. Breastfeeding can unearth hidden hurts, complexities and sensitivities about how mothers view their bodies, their breasts and themselves. None of which may be visible or apparent to someone supporting them and yet can make them feel all the more scared and isolated if they are struggling with breastfeeding.3. Understand she is driven to breastfeed beyond what she expectedFor many mothers the instinct to breastfeed is powerful. And that drive can be really hard for supporters to understand. Mothers often say that they didn’t realise it would matter so much to them. Just as sometimes a woman has an inexplicable desire and urge to have a baby, the drive to breastfeed can often come as a surprise to the woman herself. The fundamental biological instinct to feed her baby is so ingrained in what it means to be a mother, that it is beyond words. Mothers talk about “just knowing they wanted to breastfeed”. Mothers are biologically hardwired to breastfeed their babies.Petra Hoehfurtner, LLL Leader and IBCLC, in her excellent article Breastfeeding – A Woman’s Right[3] talks about the biological drive to breastfeed and she says:“But at the end of the day – when it comes to breastfeeding – our bodies and minds are run by our instincts. Therefore, if a woman, for whatever reason doesn’t succeed in breastfeeding her baby, the sense of loss and failure goes much deeper than intellect or emotions; it connects on an instinct level… This woman has ‘failed’ the human race as she hasn’t been able to do the most basic thing: to feed her baby. This sense of failure goes much deeper than any other failure someone experiences in their life.”Mothers are driven by the biological need to make sure their baby thrives. When it doesn’t go smoothly or there are challenges, many have a single-minded commitment to making it work. Not out of any external pressure to breastfeed (though others might think that), but because they want to, because it’s what their body and mind expect to happen. And they are often surprised by the shift from “I’ll try to breastfeed if I can, but I won’t worry about it” when pregnant, to “I am determined to do this, I NEED to do this” when their baby is in their arms.Some say that they didn’t expect to feel so strongly that they wanted to make it work, and that they are finding depths of determination they didn’t know they had. And this is in the context of a culture which already makes breastfeeding complicated in so many ways.One determined mother said:“Breastfeeding was something I knew I wanted to do but it was only when I found I had supply issues I discovered that I was willing to walk to the end of the Earth to try to make it work. Rationally I knew she would be fine with formula supplements, but something altogether deeper took over and I found I was willing to do practically anything to return her to being exclusively breastfed as soon as possible.”For some, that will mean days or weeks of struggling and then they get to a place where breastfeeding is what they had hoped for, and they are so relieved that they didn’t stop. And they are rightly proud of what they have achieved.And for others, they get to the point, where they make the decision to stop or her goals evolve so that she gets to a place where she is satisfied: even if it is different from what she first hoped for. Only she can make that decision if she is to gain any sense of peace with it. She has to know it’s her choice. And it might be that her goals may change.4. Tell her it’s okay to be angryAs a supporter, giving a mother space to be angry can be liberating for them. They might feel angry that system has let her down. Many who are struggling with breastfeeding have been failed at some point, by not getting the skilled support and information they needed in the early days. Or worse, that their breastfeeding relationship has been sabotaged by ill-informed support or care in the early days or weeks.They may have been told “that latch looks fine” but are still in pain or the baby is hardly swallowing, or “only feed your baby from one breast to get the really good milk” or “only feed every three hours to make sure your baby is really hungry”: all common advice which is likely to undo the breastfeeding relationship. Or when their baby fails to gain weight, they are referred to a paediatrician to find out what’s wrong with the baby, rather than anyone looking at what’s happening with breastfeeding and why the baby isn’t getting all they need at the breast.And so then not only are mothers coping with overcoming their difficulties, but they are also dealing with a sense of betrayal, isolation and lack of trust in those around who they thought were helping. It can be isolating to think “but I thought they were helping me” and feel let down by the people they put their trust in.5. And if she stops breastfeeding, let her grieveFor some, the hurdles and challenges are more than they can overcome, and they reach a point where they decide that they will stop breastfeeding. But we need to watch our language: she hasn’t ‘given up’; she hasn’t failed. It is never her fault for struggling or stopping.When mothers themselves talk about ‘giving up’, or when we use that language around her we enhance her sense of failure. Instead, she can own the decision. Just like in birth: when mothers feel in control they have a more positive birth experience whatever it might look like. She needs to be in control of the decision of when she will stop breastfeeding.And at the point of deciding to stop, especially if it has been an intense, stressful, scary, painful time mothers may feel relief. One mother said:“I was relieved and I knew it was the right decision. It was the right decision at that time – doesn’t mean it couldn’t have been different, but I’m at peace I made the right decision then. Yes, I regret it wasn’t different. But my memory of stopping is overwhelmingly one of relief.”And that’s the point. Each mother will feel differently, so it’s important that supporters don’t assume, or don’t placate. We just need to listen to what she wants to say about it. One mother who stopped breastfeeding, said about her family:“They won’t let me say I’m sad about it – every time I say something like that, they shut me down by telling me ‘I did well’, ‘she’ll be fine’. I know all that. But I want them to just let me be sad about it.”And then we often hear about GUILT: that the mother feels guilty for stopping. Or she feels guilty and wonders if maybe she didn’t try hard enough or guilty that maybe, just maybe she wonders if just doing this for herself. But guilt is so hard to deal with because no-one can fix it. But if we turn it around: and perhaps help the mother to see she is describing GRIEF, then perhaps she can start processing it. It’s a grief that breastfeeding isn’t as she has hoped for. A grief that her ideal of how she thought it would be for her and her baby isn’t the reality. It’s the grief that Petra Hoehfurtner explains as “the sense of loss and failure that goes much deeper than intellect or emotions.”But just as with any grief – mothers need to go through the process of dealing with that grief. One model proposes five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance as part of the framework of moving on. And that can take time. Some may skip or revisit different stages as part of the process. But often the instinct of those around is to want to stop her grieving, and to get her to a place of contentment with her decision. But no-one can do that for someone else – it’s grief and that’s a personal process that has its own timing.A last word to the mother who knows the struggleIn LLLGB, we often meet or talk with mothers who have gone to amazing lengths to make it work. Some are still breastfeeding, some are combination-feeding and some are no longer breastfeeding. Many have had brilliant supporters, partners, fathers, co-parents by their sides: after all it takes a team to parent a baby[4].But whatever the outcome, each of them has shown an incredible determination and strength to meet their babies’ needs. It’s not your fault. Be proud of your successes.And for those of you, who are in the middle of a struggle to make breastfeeding work right now: you are doing an amazing job. Keep asking for support from those who can help you. Celebrate your successes. Hang on in there. We hope you reach your goals – whatever they might be – and that you find a pride and peace in your achievements.Written by Justine Fieth, LLL Cambridge, 2018Further readingLLL Links:Find a LLLGB  support groupSupporting a Breastfeeding MotherDealing with criticismFinding the right supportFinding my peopleMothers on … support from our nearest and dearest1.https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/supporting-breastfeeding-make-it-happen/2.

"You may be reading this because you have a preterm baby, or because you are expecting to deliver your baby before full term and you want to be prepared. Perhaps you’re supporting someone who has recently had a preterm baby. Whatever your situation then we hope this information will help to get breastfeeding off to a successful start.Before your baby arrivesYour premature newbornEstablishing breastfeedingLooking after your own health and wellbeingTaking your breastfed baby homeBefore your baby arrivesIf you know your baby will be arriving soon, you may wish to try antenatal expression of colostrum. This is where you hand express some of the thick, creamy first milk into a sterile container such as a syringe. This can be given to your baby immediately after birth reducing the possibility of them needing to have early formula feeds. Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can cause serious long term health problems if left untreated, and preterm babies are at higher risk of low blood sugar than babies born at term. Having some colostrum ready means that this is available instead of formula (or donor milk if available).If you are at risk of early labour and taking precautions to avoid it, then consult with your healthcare professionals about your individual case before starting antenatal expression as it may be considered to increase your risk of going into labour.You can read more about antenatal expressionhere.If there is time before your baby arrives, someone from the paediatric team on the neonatal unit where your baby will be cared for should come and talk to you about how you plan to feed your baby. You can supply them with any expressed colostrum you have in a labelled container, and discuss how you wish your baby to be fed while you are establishing your milk supply.Some neonatal units will have access to donor breastmilk, and will be able to tell you if your baby will be eligible to receive this – as supply is limited, this is likely to be restricted to the babies who need it the most. They will discuss and get your consent if formula may need to be given while you are building your milk supply. This may also be the time to talk about how you want supplementary feeds to be given to your baby.Smaller or weaker babies will be given a nasogastric tube, to allow milk (your own, donor or formula) to be fed down the tube. Bigger and stronger babies may be given bottles. You may wish to discuss paced bottle feeding (the art of giving bottle feeds in a way that supports breastfeeding) or cup feeding.If you wish to express breastmilk for your baby, then your hospital should be able to provide you with a breastpump – asking for this before your baby is born means that you have it ready as early as possible. In the early days you need to be stimulating milk production in your breasts between eight and twelve times in twenty four hours, including at least once at night – this might be by your baby feeding effectively at the breast, or pumping sessions.To read more about successfully expressing breastmilk, clickhere.Your premature newbornWhen you baby arrives there is likely to be a sudden rush of activity as your baby is checked and stabilised. They may be rushed off to the neonatal unit leaving you feeling stranded in the delivery unit. Be kind to yourself. You may feel that starting to express milk is a practical way that you can be involved in their care even when you are apart from each other.There is evidence to show that if you start expressing within the first hour after birth it can have a long term positive effect on your milk supply.Establishing breastfeedingYou may be expressing on your ward (if you are still an inpatient) or on the neonatal unit. Many mothers find that being close to their babies while they are expressing can help to increase the amount that they are able to express. If you are separated, looking at photos of your baby can help or smelling something that has been close them.If you are expressing on the unit, you may wish to be close to your baby as you do so. Some mothers use screens for privacy. You can ask for these to be provided. You don’t have to use screens if you prefer not to – using scarves or nothing at all is a completely acceptable choice. Do what you feel comfortable with and helps your milk to flow easily. Listening to music may help you to relax and increase your milk production.You are the person most known and familiar to your baby. Being with you is the safest and most secure they can possibly feel. If your baby is very fragile they may not be able to come out of their incubator at first. Ask the staff how you can be involved in their care and to show you how to hold and comfort them through the vents in the incubator. Once your baby is able to come out of the incubator, thenkangaroo carecan become an important part of your time together. This is where your baby is placed skin to skin on your chest for as long as possible and a blanket put over both of you. Your baby is able to enjoy the sensations of your closeness and the deep relaxation and comfort they feel helps them to regulate their breathing, temperature and other health indicators. It also helps your breast to become a familiar environment and allows them to practise feeding directly from the breast easily.It used to be thought that babies under a certain gestation didn’t have the ability to suck and swallow, or that directly breastfeeding was tiring to them. Happily, more recent studies have disproved these concerns. Once babies are well enough to breathe unaided (off ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure – CPAP), they can be brought to the breast. Smaller and younger babies will still need to have some of their milk given to them via tube feeds, but this allows you and your baby to learn to breastfeed together without a feeling of pressure.Smaller babies have smaller mouths and lower muscle tone. This may mean you need extra support to get breastfeeding established. Seek skilled help early and often. Keep asking until you findsomeone who is able to support you effectively.Premature babies often find it easier to feed in laid back breastfeeding positions. This is where you are supported in a reclined position with your baby tummy down on top of you. This helps gravity to ‘stick’ your baby to you and stops them slipping off. If you need to sit in a more upright position, then supporting the whole length of your baby’s body close to yours with a hand behind their shoulders means they don’t have to support their weight and stops them from curling in on themselves. Read more about laid back breastfeedinghere.You may find that your baby quickly falls asleep when breastfeeding. This isn’t a sign that you are exhausting them, but that they are small and being soothed. You can help them to stay awake for longer by washing their face with cool water, gently blowing on them or tickling their feet. You may find that breast compressions – gently smoothing down your breast towards the nipple – helps your baby to stay alert and interested in feeding as this makes the milk flow more quickly and easily for them.All new babies need to feed frequently – and premature babies are no different. The volume of milk that their stomachs can take at each feed is very small, and breastmilk is easily digested. It is normal for babies to feed between 8-12 times in a 24 hour period, including at least once at night.Neonatal unit staff need to be able to ensure that all the babies in their care are receiving the right amount of milk for them to grow. Premature or sick babies may be less able to communicate their need for milk. These two things combined mean that units often use feeding schedules, with feeds timetabled every two, three, or even four hours.When you agree how often your baby is to be offered supplemental feeds (any milk not directly from the breast) it may be helpful to remember that four hourly is less frequently than you would expect a healthy, full term newborn to feed. You may also choose to consider these as ‘backup’ feeds – any time spent feeding directly from the breast doesn’t reset the clock, but is bonus extra calories. Keep writing down how often you are breastfeeding in your baby’s notes, as this may help you and the staff to feel confident about the transition from scheduled, measured feeds, to baby led, responsive feeding.One of the things the unit staff will look for in a baby coming close to going home is that your baby is able to rouse themselves to feed. If your baby is waking for feeds more often than their feeding ‘schedule’ (and you are spotting signs of effective feeding), this may be a sign that they are becoming better able to manage their own need for milk. You will probably need to keep offering more frequently than they ask for milk – this is true for many babies. Remember, you can’t feed too often, and your baby can always say no if they don’t want milk right now!Breastmilk is an incredibly responsive food, made specially for each baby. The milk that you are making for your premature baby will be even more densely nutritious than the milk of a full term mother. Every drop of milk that you can supply for your baby is like medicine – strengthening and building their immune system and providing the calories they need to grow. Some mothers feel that providing milk for their babies is a unique way that they can care for their babies. It can be an important part of bonding with a new and fragile baby. While your baby will continue to benefit from your milk for as long as you provide it, you aren’t tied to expressing for longer than you want to do so. If you decide it’s time to stop, then gradually reducing your pumping sessions will slow and stop your milk production without causing problems for you.Looking after your own heath and wellbeingYou will be recovering from pregnancy and birth, and may be experiencing additional health problems. It is important to remember to look after yourself – the more smoothly your recovery goes, the more strength and energy you will have to become more and more involved in your baby’s care. If you have older children at home, you may be struggling to balance meeting their needs with being present with your newborn. Many mothers have to leave hospital long before their baby is ready to come home and have to travel back and forwards to be with their baby. This is a time to say yes to as many offers of help as you possibly can. If someone can provide a lift, deliver a meal, entertain an older child or do a load of washing – or just sit with you to talk things over in the hospital cafe – these may make life a little easier for you and help you to keep going at a difficult time.You may be taking medications yourself and be concerned about them passing through your milk. Discuss your concerns with your and your baby’s medical teams. They may be able to reassure you or find suitable alternatives. For specialist information about whether a drug is compatible with breastfeeding, you can contact your local LLL Leader who has access to resources and professional support.It may feel impossibly painful to keep leaving your baby. Remember that by looking after yourself – eating, sleeping and taking the medication you need to get well – you are making sure that you carry on being able to be there to look after your baby.Taking your breastfed baby homeSeparately to any health issues your baby may be facing, your neonatal unit will want to know that you are able to make sure your baby is getting enough milk to continue growing. Being aware of your baby’s early hunger cues is important so that you can feed responsively and before baby gets too upset. You may have a very sleepy baby who still needs your help to wake themselves up to feed beyond their due date. Setting an alarm for the middle of the night can help you to make sure they don’t go for longer than a four hour stretch without feeding at night.Read more about recognising early hunger cues and about waking a sleepy babyhere.Read more about how to tell if your baby is getting enough milkhere.Many breastfeeding mothers and babies enjoy safe cosleeping. Premature babies are at greater risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or Sudden Unexplained Death in Infancy (SIDS/SUDI). While they will benefit from sleeping close to their mother, premature babies should sleep on a separate, firm surface such as a sidecar cot.It can be scary to make the transition from caring for your baby in hospital with a team of staff around you, to being at home. Your healthcare professionals are likely to make extra visits to support you and to keep an eye on your baby’s weight gain. You may find that being home together, able to stay together all the time, and in a comfortable environment, you rapidly get to know and understand your baby more easily and become more confident in your mothering skills.Photo credits: Olivia Brown and other mothersOther resourcesYou can read amother’s storyabout mothering her premature baby through special careThisvideolooks at breastfeeding in the first hour after birthThedrugs in breastmilk service, while not an LLL resource, gives quick access to information from a qualified pharmacistTheSmall Wondersfilms follow families through their experiences of having a baby on a neonatal unitGlobal Health Mediahave a series of videos about various aspects of life with a small baby",https://laleche.org.uk/successfully-breastfeeding-premature-baby/,Successfully breastfeeding your premature baby
"Many new parents are surprised to find themselves feeling helpless when their baby first arrives. However well you prepare for your baby’s arrival, it is common to lack confidence or to worry that you don’t know what to do.There are thousands of books which will confidently tell you precisely what your baby needs; apps to keep track of whether you and your baby are doing the right things at the right times; healthcare professionals with charts and lists of milestones to tell you how your baby should be developing; family, friends and even strangers may be telling you how to take care of a baby and what you shouldn’t do.However well-meaning all this advice and support, it can often feel like you are being told that you’re wrong, told that you don’t know anything, or criticised for the choices that you are making. Sometimes as mothers we can feel criticised even when nothing is being said at all; the very fact that other people choose to parent in a different way can make us feel like they must think we are doing the wrong things.Responding to commentsTalking with friends and familyExpressing your opinions and feelingsDisagreements with healthcare professionalsHow to cope with feeling criticisedResponding to commentsIf someone else asks questions about the way you parent your child, or tells you that you should be doing something differently, you don’t necessarily need to discuss it in detail. For example, a neighbour might suggest giving your child a dummy when you have chosen not to, or a stranger in a shop might tell your toddler “you’re too heavy for your mummy to keep carrying you around like that!”. Particularly if the person is well-meaning, and perhaps someone who doesn’t have much involvement in your child’s life, it can be enough to have a few stock phrases to use. Here are some suggestions that parents have found helpful:“Thanks for your suggestion, I’ll think about it / maybe I’ll try to find out more about that.”“This is working for us right now, but we may decide to do things differently as time passes.”“You’re right, it’s difficult to get a baby to sleep / help a toddler to be more independent. How did you manage that with your children?”“We’re working on it! I’m sure things will be different / he’ll be out of nappies / he won’t still be breastfeeding by the time he leaves home!”“My midwife/health visitor/GP recommended that I do it like this, I’m just following instructions.”“I know it looks like hard work, but we’ve tried lots of ways and this is what we all enjoy most.”Or you can just smile, thank the person for their support, and change the subject to a less controversial one.Talking with friends and familyIf the criticism or disagreement comes from people close to you, it might not be as simple as moving the conversation on to an easier topic. You may well want the important people in your life to support and encourage you as a mother, and differences of opinion can really get in the way of that.If you think it would be helpful to discuss a disagreement in more detail, you could plan to bring it up at a time when you are relaxed and have enough time to do the conversation justice, and invite the other person or people to discuss it with you. For example, you could start with “I’ve been thinking about what you said the other day about me picking up my daughter when she cries. Would it be OK for us to talk some more about that? I’d like to understand what you think about it. Is this a good time?”Also think about what you want to get out of the discussion. You might be having this conversation with somebody like your partner or a grandparent who regularly takes care of your child and treats them in a way that is different from your own parenting style. In that case it could be important to you to persuade this person to change their opinion, or at least their behaviour, so that your child is not treated in a way that you find unacceptable.However, in many circumstances it is not necessary to try and persuade another person that you are right. Particularly if you are talking to someone who has treated their children in a very different way from you, trying to persuade them that they have made mistakes as a parent may not be constructive. It can be helpful to bear in mind that the person talking to you may have raised children many years ago, or in another country or culture, and the advice they were given about how to treat children could be very different. You may be able to find ways of acknowledging that they did their best with the information they had at the time, just as you are trying to do now.Expressing your opinions and feelingsOften, if you feel criticised or attacked, you just want an opportunity to express your point of view, or to defend your right to make your own choices about parenting. Even if the other person does not change their mind, it is common to feel better simply because you’ve been able to express yourself or defend your decisions. In this case, it can really help to start the conversation in a way that makes it clear you are not trying to start an argument, but would just like to express your thoughts.For example:“I know you and I have made very different decisions about discipline / weaning / etc. I’m sure you’re doing what works best for you and your family, just like I am.”“When you tell me that I’m spoiling my baby, I feel criticised and hurt.”“If there was one right way to look after a baby, all our lives would be a lot simpler, but I’m enjoying getting to know my baby and finding out what they need from me.”“Different approaches might work for different babies, and for different parents too.”Many of us find the day-to-day work and decision-making of mothering to be draining and difficult at times, and often we just want emotional support from those around us. When family and friends offer practical suggestions, they may be trying to acknowledge the demands of parenting and help you to cope, but it can feel like criticism. You can help loved ones to support you by describing the kind of support you feel you need:“I know that it’s hard for you to see me so tired, and I appreciate your offer to look after the baby so I can rest, but even though it’s tiring I do feel better having him with me. If you’d like to help, I’d love… [to come round to have lunch with you one day / some company in the evening when they’re fretful / someone to take my toddler to the playground so I can nap when my baby does]”“You’re right that I’m having some difficulties with breastfeeding, but it’s really important to me to make this work for me and my baby. I could really do with some encouragement to keep me going through the difficult days.”“When I tell you I’ve had a bad day, I know you want to come up with solutions to make life better for me. What helps me most is if you can listen and give me a hug, then I feel like I’ve got the strength to carry on.”“I’m working this out as I go, just like any parent, and doing the things that we find work best for us. Even though it must be strange to see me doing some things very differently from how you did them with your children, it means a lot to me to know that you want the best for us, and that you love us even when you disagree.”Disagreements with healthcare professionalsSometimes a healthcare professional may suggest approaches that you are not comfortable with, or may disagree with decisions you take as a parent. This could be anything from a health visitor suggesting early introduction of solids to a doctor prescribing a medical intervention that you do not want your child to have. Many parents find it hard to speak up when they are being given instructions by someone who has some kind of authority; it can help you to feel more confident if you prepare in advance, take someone with you for support, or put your concerns in writing if you find that easier.Here are some suggestions for how to approach difficult conversations with healthcare professionals:Ask for information: what are the expected benefits of the suggested action and how likely are they? What are the possible risks and how likely are they? What are the current evidence and best practice guidelines in this area? What alternatives are there? Is it possible to get a second opinion?Offer information: talk with your healthcare professional about any information you have and where it came from; look for respected sources of information such as medical journals and NHS guidelines. Give any background information that you think may be relevant (such as “my first baby was also on the 5thcentile for weight at this age”,  or “we have a family history of allergies and eczema”).Don’t be afraid to express your opinions and feelings. For example, “I understand that you believe this is in my daughter’s best interests, but it’s important for me as her mother to understand exactly what you’re recommending and why.”Remember that healthcare professionals have good intentions and want the best for the children they work with, even if you disagree with their views.Healthcare professionals have experience and training in their specialism; you have expertise and experience with your own child. Working together and using their medical knowledge and your understanding of your child can help everyone to find the best possible course of action.How to cope with feeling criticisedParenting can be tiring and difficult, and feeling criticised or unsupported by people around you can make it harder. It is important to take care of yourself, and to find ways to let off steam or wind down. It can be really good to have at least one supportive friend or relative who is willing to listen to you without judging or making suggestions, and to support you whether or not they agree with all the decisions you make. You may have other ways of dealing with stress – through exercise, creativity, relaxation; it can be hard to continue taking care of yourself in these ways once you have children to look after, but spending some time on your own wellbeing can really help you to be the kind of parent you hope to be.And don’t forget that you can contact other mothers through La Leche League, whether by speaking to a Leader on thehelpline, attending a meeting of your local group or joining them on social media. Our aim is to provide mother to mother support, by listening without judgement and providing a welcoming atmosphere, whatever your choices and experiences.Find your local grouphere.Written by Emma Taylor for LLLGB",https://laleche.org.uk/dealing-with-criticism/,Dealing with criticism

"As new parents, we suddenly find ourselves examining our babies’ poo more closely than we could ever have imagined. We pay attention to the colour, quantity, texture and smell, and notice the slightest changes. We then go to the internet looking for answers and fear the worst. There are many versions of normal, and we will share some of these below.When your baby is born, your colostrum (first milk) has laxative and diuretic compounds in it to make your baby wee and poo. In the first few days your midwife and health visitor will ask how many wet and dirty nappies your baby has had, so you may find it helpful to take note of how many nappies you change.Your baby may not poo much at first but this will increase as your milk comes in. For an idea of how many poos to expect, seehttps://laleche.org.uk/is-my-baby-getting-enough-milk/#dirtynappiesIt can be tricky to tell if disposable nappies are wet – after five full days, when copious milk comes in, they should be heavy.Many disposable nappies have a faint line down the middle of the nappy which changes colour when wet.You can feel what a properly wet nappy should feel like by putting three tablespoons (45ml) of water onto a clean, dry one. Urine should be pale and mild smelling.This post onsigns of effective feedinghas more information.Pictures 1-9 below show the contents of one baby’s nappy in the first few days of their life, to give you an idea of what to expect from a healthy, full-term baby. If you have any concerns about your baby’s poo, or if you see blood in the nappy (beyond the first few days, when baby girls can have a mini period caused by birth hormones), don’t hesitate to contact your midwife, health visitor or GP.Picture 1Baby’s first bowel movement, called meconium, is tar-like, sticky and hard to remove.Picture 2Baby’s second bowel movement.Picture 3Poo from the first day of baby’s life. Reddish pink urate crystals are visible in this nappy; see picture 10 for more about urates.Picture 4Bowel movement on day two. Your baby’s poo will gradually change colour, from black to green to brown. It becomes a lot easier to wipe off as your baby begins to drink more milk.Picture 5Day three bowel movement. Looking a lot paler, heading towards a yellowish colour, and much less sticky.Picture 6Day four bowel movement.Picture 7Day five bowel movement.Picture 8Day six bowel movement.Picture 9Day ten bowel movement. By this age most fully breastfed babies’ poo will be this pale yellow colour. It is common for babies to have what are described as “explosive” poos, which may take you by surprise if your baby poos while you are changing their nappy!The following pictures show some ways in which your baby’s poo may look different from the typical pattern shown above.Picture 10In the first few days, you may see reddish pink crystals called urates in your baby’s nappy. They are often described as looking like brick dust. As your baby begins to take more milk, the urates should stop appearing in her nappy.Picture 11Sometimes your baby’s poo may be light green rather than yellow, and have small lumps in it like cottage cheese. This is common and not significant by itself, unless your baby has other symptoms that you are worried about.Picture 12This poo came from a three-week-old baby who was given Gaviscon because of reflux. When the medication was stopped, the baby went back to having runny yellow stools.Picture 13After the 12-week injections this baby had green poo, which went back to being yellow after a few days.Picture 14This dark green poo came from a baby who was later diagnosed with cow’s milk protein intolerance.Picture 15This poo, containing mucus, came from a baby diagnosed with allergies. Mucus in the poo is also common when a baby has a heavy cold, but this should be temporary and should stop when the baby is well again. If your baby’s nappy has persistent or unexplained mucus in it, seek medical advice.Picture 16As your baby starts to eat solid foods, you will see the results in his nappy. It is common for your baby’s very first foods to come out looking almost exactly as they did when they went in, as his digestive system is not used to dealing with these other foods yet. This is much easier to spot if your baby is eating finger foods rather than mashed food; the mashed foods are passing through semi-digested in the same way, but are less obvious in the nappy.With time, your baby’s poo will gradually change from yellow liquid to soft brown lumps, and you won’t generally see pieces of food. However, some foods are hard to digest and tend to pass through the body unchanged (even for older children or adults). This picture shows an 11-month-old’s nappy with partially digested grapes visible in it. Strongly coloured foods (like blackberries or beetroot) can also affect the appearance of your baby’s wee and poo.Written by Amanda Dunbar and Emma Taylor for LLLGB, 2017",https://laleche.org.uk/whats-in-a-nappy/,What’s in a nappy?
"After the work of getting things going, you may feel that breastfeeding should become easy and enjoyable. People talk about the amazing bond that comes with breastfeeding, or that wonderful oxytocin rush. There seems to be an increase in both classical art and stock photographs (no doubt very posed!) posted online showing glowing mothers nursing content babies.So what if you simply don’t enjoy it? What if you have a distracted and fussy baby? What if you feel self-conscious breastfeeding in public? What if your darling baby insists on pinching and nipping at every feed? Or quite simply, what if it just feels like a chore?Essentially, all of these feelings (and more) are very normal and it’s a rare mother who enjoys every single moment of her nursing journey, however long that may be. La Leche League is all about mothering through breastfeeding – not just the mechanics of getting a pain-free latch – and we are here to celebrate your successes and also support you when it’s a chore.It’s important to remember that breastfeeding is two way – it’s a relationship between you and your child. If there’s a part of it that isn’t working, it’s fine to change it.Society often isn’t overly understanding of breastfeeding, especially once a baby gets a little bit older. Getting support and realising your experiences are not unique is massively important. Many mothers have found that support via LLL – either face-to-face atmeetingsor via Facebook groups and forums. Realising you are not alone and that itwillpass are invaluable.Find Your Nearest GroupAs your baby heads towards toddlerhood, it’s absolutely fine to put limits on nursing and insist on ‘nursing manners’. Lots of mothers find ‘fiddle’ necklaces can help divert nipping fingers. Breastfeeding is about so much more than nutrition – it’s an emotional connection and a way of mothering. For a toddler who is mastering new skills and discovering the big wide world, this is invaluable. For the mother of an 18 month old with a child nursing more often than a newborn, it can be extremely trying. Setting limits, and self-care, as well as support and understanding from others, can help each mother find the balance that is right for them and ensure that nursing continues in a positive light for the dyad.Many mothers find they experience nursing aversion due to hormonal changes. Some mothers find they struggle around ovulation or during their period. For other mothers, a nursing aversion may be the first sign of pregnancy. Many mothers find nursing through pregnancy tough, and even painful. Some practical suggestions that mums find useful include limiting the duration of feeds (counting up to or down from 10, singing a nursery rhyme etc.) and using distraction to limit the number of feeds. Keeping well hydrated and well rested can help too.Some mums will find themselves feeding two children – a toddler (or older) and a newborn. Whilst there are many positives to tandem nursing, some mums will not want to feed both children at the same time, as they find this overwhelming. Again, this is perfectly fine – LLL is here to help you meet your own breastfeeding goals and find a balance that works for your family.Click here if you are Pregnant and Breastfeeding or Tandem Nursing.Depression or other negative emotions upon milk let-down (D-MER)Whilst not enjoying breastfeeding all the time, or developing nursing aversion is very common, a small number of women experience far stronger negative emotions when breastfeeding.This is called Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex, or D-MER. According toD-MER.org, “Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex is a condition affecting lactating women that is characterised by an abrupt dysphoria, or negative emotions, that occur just before milk release and continuing not more than a few minutes.” This is a physiological response (not a psychological response) that appears to be tied to a sudden decrease in the brain chemical dopamine immediately before milk let-down, and mothers may experience feelings of depression, anxiety, homesickness, agitation or anger, immediately before they feel milk let-down.This is rare, but extremely distressing for the mother. Please contact yourlocal LLL Leaderwho can support you if you suspect this is something you are dealing with.Following are some resources for more information:D-MER.orgis a website devoted to information about Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex.Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-MER)from the Australian Breastfeeding Association.Heise AM, Wiessinger D.Dysphoric milk ejection reflex: A case report.Int Breastfeed J. 2011 Jun 6;6(1):6.Cox S.A case of dysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER).Breastfeed Rev. 2010 Mar;18(1):16-8.What is D-MER?, from LLLI’s Breastfeeding TodayYou may also find the following on Breastfeeding aversion helpfulWhen Breastfeeding SucksZainab Yate 2020 available form the LLLGB BookshopBreastfeeding AversionNegative Feelings: D-MER and AversionWritten by Rae Lowe for LLLGB, 2017",https://laleche.org.uk/dont-enjoy-breastfeeding/,When You Don’t Enjoy Breastfeeding
"When it comes to teething, all babies are different: a very few are born with teeth already erupted through their gums, while others may reach their first birthday without any.  In general, most babies will have that first little flash of white in their gums by six months old, and by two years old she may well have sixteen teeth. In the six months after that, the final four big back teeth often called “two year molars” will probably emerge.Signs of teethingDealing with teething painHow teething may affect breastfeedingSigns of teethingMany parents find that teething symptoms are worst in the period before a tooth actually emerges, while it is working its way up through the baby’s gum. Some of the signs that parents report include:Changes in the way a baby latches on to the breast: feeding your baby may start to be uncomfortable, or she may change the position of her mouth or head, or her latch may just feel a bit differentDribbling: your baby is suddenly drooling all the time, and you may find yourself needing to change her bib or top several times a dayRedness and rash: your baby’s cheeks may be flushed bright red, and she may have a red rash around her mouth and chinLoose stools: your baby’s poo may seem runnier than usual, it may seem to irritate her skin more than usual if she isn’t changed immediately, and she may develop nappy rashBiting and chewing: you might notice that your baby is chewing her fingers or fist; all young babies put objects into their mouths as a way of exploring them, but you may feel that your baby is chewing his toys with more determination than usualNight waking: any pain or discomfort can disrupt your baby’s usual sleep patternSlightly raised temperature: some parents have said that their babies run a low-level fever at the point when a new tooth actually comes through the gum, warmer than usual but not hot enough to cause serious concern.Warning! Some of the symptoms listed above can also be signs of illness. If your baby has diarrhoea or a fever, or you are worried about his health, please seek medical advice.Dealing with teething painSpecially designed teething toys can give your baby some relief from the discomfort in his gums. Look out for toys with plenty of surface texture, or little bumps or projections to chew on. Some teething rings are filled with water and can be kept in the fridge or freezer until they are needed. You don’t have to use specially designed toys, though: many babies enjoy chewing a flannel that has been run under a cold tap and then wrung out, especially if it has been kept in the fridge to cool down. You can also try massaging the sore spot on your baby’s gums with your finger, if he seems to enjoy it. A baby who is cutting teeth further back in the mouth might like to have a toothbrush or similarly-shaped toy to chew on; you can buy a “first toothbrush” without bristles if you are concerned about your baby chewing them off.If your baby is eating solids, you can give him hard foods to chew on, like fingers of apple or carrot. Be aware that once your baby has actually cut a tooth, even the tip of it can be sharp enough to break a chunk off something like a raw carrot, so supervise him carefully and use your judgement about appropriate foods to offer. You could try freezing foods, such as fingers of banana, or freeze plain unsweetened yogurt into lollies (either use small lolly moulds, or place small spoonfuls onto a tray in the freezer with a lolly stick or baby’s spoon in each one).Don’t forget that breastfeeding can be really soothing for a baby who is unhappy or in pain. Occasionally a well-meaning person might advise a breastfeeding mother that a baby should be weaned from the breast when his first tooth comes through, but this simply isn’t necessary. The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding for at least the first two years of a baby’s life; mothers around the world have happily breastfed their babies through teething, and even up to the age when the permanent teeth emerge.How teething may affect breastfeedingLatch:Sore or swollen gums, or the presence of new teeth at the front of your baby’s mouth, may affect the way that she latches on to breastfeed. You may find it helpful to experiment with different feeding positions to find one that is comfortable for both of you. This is also a good time to keep an eye on your baby’s latch: make sure he is opening his mouth wide to latch on, ideally with his tongue visible above his lower teeth, and that he islatching deeply onto your breast.  If sore gums are interfering with feeding, try some of the tips above for addressing the pain immediately before feeding. Be careful about using anything frozen, or any purchased teething remedy that numbs your baby’s mouth, immediately before feeding, as the numbness can affect his ability to latch correctly.Biting:Sometimes a baby who has been dealing with teething pain by biting anything he can get hold of may experiment with doing the same thing to his mother’s breast. For some ideas on how to respond to biting, seethis page.  It is important to bear in mind that when a baby is correctly latched on to breastfeed, her tongue covers her lower teeth, so it should be impossible for her to bite you while actively feeding without biting her own tongue. A newly-emerged tooth is very sharp, in order to help it cut through the gum, so you may get a scratch from it during feeding. If your nipple is sore because of a bite or scratch, try using a different feeding position next time so that your baby’s teeth don’t touch the sore spot, and treat between feeds with pure lanolin or a hydrogel pad if necessary.Frequency of feeding:You may already have discovered that breastfeeding can be a brilliant way of soothing your baby if she is unhappy, or in pain: after vaccinations or during illness, for example. If your baby is suffering with teething pain, she may ask to feed more often, possibly for quite short periods each time. If you are happy to feed her as often as she wants, then it can really help both of you to get through this tricky time. But if your baby’s teething is making it uncomfortable to feed her, you may not feel like offering the breast every time she asks for it. You can use the suggestions above to address problems with latching and biting, and you can experiment with other ways of distracting her from the pain. Mothers over the years have tried many things, and common tricks include carrying your baby, taking her for a walk outside, dancing with her, singing to her, giving her a warm bath, and anything else that you have found that works for her.Dealing with dribble:It seems to be common for a teething baby’s dribble to irritate his skin. Make sure you keep him dry and clean, by gently washing or wiping his chin. You may want to do this immediately before offering him the breast, so that his dribble doesn’t irritate your skin too.Written by Emma Taylor for LLLGB, 2017",https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-and-teething/,Breastfeeding and teething
"Most babies are keen to feed in the first 90 minutes after they are born especially if they are in skin-to-skin contact with their mum.If your baby is too sleepy to take this first feed or needs medical attention, it’s a good idea to ask your healthcare team to show you how to hand express and give the colostrum by teaspoon or syringe. He may sleep for a few hours after this first feed – feel free to cuddle him and wake him if you want to feed. He may feed four to five more times in the first 24 hours.After that first 24 hours we know that babies who are getting adequate amounts of milk will wake to feedat least eight  times over a 24-hour period (10 to 12 times being more likely)so it is valuable to keep an eye on numbers and offer feeds even if the baby does not seem to be actively asking.Babies need to feed frequently; this encourages your milk to increase in volume. Once your milk is coming in, after about 48 hours or so, you may hear your baby swallowing. You may also notice that your breasts feel fuller and that after your baby has fed they soften a little.Babies who areexcessively sleepy, reluctant to wake or who only wake briefly and suckle for very short times will need some extra milk, and your colostrum is best. Learn how tohand expressand give your expressed colostrum frequently, until your baby is waking, keen to latch and is doing active sucking and swallowing, with pauses.Your baby will be content and satisfied after most feeds and will come off the breast on his own. A period of cluster feeding each day (or night) is common. When a baby is cluster feeding he may be very keen to breastfeed a lot and not want to settle to sleep for three or four hours.However, if you feel he is never really satisfied after feeds, trust your instincts: some expressed milk might help. Seek help withpositioning and attachmentso that your baby can learn to extract milk efficiently himself.You can get support from LLLhere.These videos may help with positioning and attachment:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjt-Ashodw8https://vimeo.com/11692547There are more videos along with images and descriptions in our post:Positioning & AttachmentKeeping an eye on his nappies can help you know if he is getting enough milkPoosAt first poo is sticky, black, and almost tar like. This will become greenish, less sticky, and wipe off your baby’s skin easier! By day three/four you will notice the poo change colour to mustard yellow, and it will be soft and seedy.Two or more of these poos every 24 hours are a sign your baby is getting enough milk in the early days. After three full days (72 hours) your baby should produce at least three poos per day.By five to six weeks your baby will develop his own pattern and may go days without a poo. Providing he is gaining weight ok, poos are no longer as important for being confident he is getting enough milk.WeesAt first your baby may not pass much urine but this increases each day. If you have had extra fluids during labour and birth your baby may produce extra urine for the first 24 hours or so. By day two look for two wet nappies over 24 hours, days three and four look for three or more wet nappies each 24 hours. By the time your baby is five days old, wet nappies should be more frequent, usually six or more over  24 hours.If your baby’s urine output is less than this or you see red/orange specks in your baby’s nappy, (these are called urates) your baby could do with some more milk.It can be tricky to tell if disposable nappies are wet – after five full days, when copious milk comes in, they should be heavy.Many disposable nappies have a faint line down the middle of the nappy which changes colour when wet.If you are worried your baby isn’t getting enough milk, considerhand expressingyour milk. You can feed the expressed milk by teaspoon, cup or directly into his mouth. With some extra milk your baby will generally start to wake more and feed more actively.If you are concerned that your baby isn’t well contact your midwife or GP.There is more information in these posts:Is my baby getting enough milk?My baby needs more milkBreastfeeding concernsOccasionally there is reason to be concerned about a baby’s weight gain or the way he is breastfeeding. Here are some signs that your baby may not be getting enough milk at the breast:If your baby has not regained his birth weight by two weeks of ageIf baby is passing less urine and pooing less frequently than described above, or his poos remain dark, then seek additional support and give more milk.

"It’s not unusual for a baby to test out his new teeth on his mother. Some will breastfeed for months or years without even a tiny nip, some may do it once or twice, while some babies are more persistent biters.He isn’t trying to hurt you – he isn’t yet able to understand that he is causing you pain.Some mothers have even been advised by other people that “you’ll have to stop breastfeeding now he’s got teeth”, which is absolutely not the case. The World Health Organisation recommends two years or more of breastfeeding, so there’s no hurry to stop just because your baby has teeth; we do call them ‘milk teeth’, after all! (Seehttps://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-beyond-a-year/for more information)However, the pain of being bitten, or the fear of being bitten again, can really get in the way of a comfortable breastfeeding relationship with your baby, so it’s important to find some ways of dealing with the biting so that you and your baby can continue to feed in comfort.Why did she bite me?It’s hard to know exactly why a baby bites for the first time, as she can’t tell us what’s going on, but there are a number of situations where mothers often notice biting.Baby is teethingSometimes a baby who is cutting a new tooth will bite on anything he can get hold of to ease the pain in his jaws and gums, and unfortunately that includes his mother’s breast or nipple. Most mothers notice that biting is most likely while the tooth is on its way through, rather than after it has erupted through the gum, though a brand new tooth can be very sharp so may leave a scratch even if your baby doesn’t clamp down with it. Read our post onteething.Baby has a cold or a blocked up noseWhen your baby has a stuffy nose, it can be really hard for her to get an effective latch on the breast and breathe comfortably while feeding. In her attempts to latch on, or in frustration at not being able to latch, she may bite down.Baby wants mother’s attentionWhen you have a young baby, breastfeeding can be a rare opportunity to turn your attention to something else, like texting a friend, reading a book or shopping on the internet. A tiny baby doesn’t seem to notice much if your attention is elsewhere (though she enjoys it a lot when you look at her and talk to her), but a baby of a few months or older may discover that a quick bite is a very effective way of getting your attention away from your phone or book: suddenly you’re looking at her and talking to her, even if you do have an angry expression on your face!Baby is distracted while feedingYou may be feeding your baby in a noisy environment, possibly with an older sibling doing something interesting in the background. For the first few months, a baby at the breast seems oblivious to everything else, but as he gets older he starts to take an interest in what’s going on around him as he feeds. He may decide to turn and look at whatever has caught his attention, but may keep tight hold of your nipple while he does so. Ouch!Baby is experimenting with cause and effectAs soon has your baby is able to control her arms and legs, you will notice her trying to reach for objects and interact with the world; an older child will spend what seems like hours building a tower and knocking it down, or banging two objects together to hear the sound they make. Life is just one big experiment, and this is how babies and children learn about the world they live in. Unfortunately for you, this includes using his mouth and teeth to find out about the taste and texture of objects, including your breast; and if you yelp or jump, your baby will probably want to know whether you will react in the same interesting way if he does the same thing again. And again, and again…Milk flow has slowed downWhen your baby first latches on to your breast, the milk usually flows quite quickly. As the feed goes on, he has some to work a little harder to get the thicker, creamier milk from your breast. Sometimes a hungry baby might use all kinds of tricks to try and speed up the milk flowing, such as bobbing his head against your breast, wriggling, fiddling with the other breast, or, yes, biting.Baby is not in a sustainable positionA baby who feels like she isn’t being held securely while she’s feeding, or who is having to bend her neck to reach your breast, may try and grip your breast with her mouth to keep her in position. As your baby’s body grows longer, the positions that were comfortable for feeding a newborn might not work any more, although the change is so gradual that you might not notice until feeding becomes uncomfortable. Have a look athttps://laleche.org.uk/comfortable-breastfeeding/.Baby has been using a bottle, dummy or sippy cupIf your baby has any drinks from a bottle or a cup with a spout, or if he uses a dummy, he may have discovered the pleasure of biting the teat or spout, either to deal with teething pain or just to see what it feels like. It can be hard for him to understand that it’s fine for him to bite his bottle or cup, but not to bite your breast when he’s feeding.Baby is premature or has low muscle toneMost of this advice is focused on a baby who has been feeding well but starts biting at a few months of age. However, a baby who is premature or who is born with overactive muscle tone (hypertonia) may reflexively “clamp down” with his jaws whenever anything touches the inside of his mouth. If this is the case for your baby, try waiting for him to open his mouth wide and extend his tongue before you latch him on, so that your breast touches his tongue rather than his lower gums. You can ask for medical advice from your healthcare professional, and breastfeeding support and information from La Leche League.Find LLL supporthere.What should I do if it happens?When a baby bites, a mother’s automatic reaction is often to shout, and to pull the baby off the breast. This is understandable when you are startled by the pain of an unexpected bite, but it’s not the most effective way of responding. A loud or sudden yell can frighten some babies enough to put them off breastfeeding entirely, and pulling the baby off the breast while his jaw is still clamped onto it can be more painful than the original bite.If your baby bites, respond immediately and firmly. Say “no!” or say her name sharply. If she hasn’t already let go, although you might feel the urge to push her away, instead try pulling her closer to you. As your breast covers her nose she will automatically open her mouth to be able to breathe. If this doesn’t work, you can try slipping your finger between her jaws to open her mouth.Try offering her another chance to latch on properly and feed, if she seems to want more milk. If she has bitten before, or if you feel angry with her for biting you, it may be best to put her down entirely, take a break if you need one, then offer her more milk when she asks for it and when you feel ready. If you think she is getting frustrated by a slow milk flow, try offering the other breast. You could also try offering an alternative, such as a teething ring or a cup of water.How can I stop it from happening?At the beginning of a feed, make sure you and your baby are in a comfortable position for feeding and that he can reach your breast comfortably. Encourage him to open his mouth wide and make sure that he latches on correctly (seehttps://laleche.org.uk/positioning-attachment/).When your baby is latched on properly and feeding well, make sure he gets plenty of loving attention: make eye contact, stroke his hair, hold his hand. When it’s possible, feeding in a quiet environment might help him to stay focused on feeding. Although this isn’t always possible, try to minimise distractions as much as possible. Many mothers find their babies are less likely to bite when they are sleepy.When your baby is latched on and feeding effectively, his tongue should be between his lower teeth and your breast.This means he cannot bite while he is feeding without biting his own tongue. If your baby has been biting, pay attention to him while he feeds. You may notice that he doesn’t seem to be actively feeding any more, or you may feel him moving his tongue out of the way, unlatching from your breast or shifting the position of his head.These are warning signs that he may bite, so if you notice this, you might like to unlatch him by slipping your finger into the corner of his mouth and gently removing him from the breast.If he wants more milk you can allow him to feed again from the same breast or the other side, paying close attention to getting a good position and latch.If you think your baby is biting because of teething pain,try allowing him to chew on teething toys, or if he is eating solids try freezing a peeled banana, or using plain unsweetened yogurt to make ice lollies. Your baby may enjoy chewing a damp flannel that has been kept in the fridge, or he may let you massage his gums with your finger to ease the pain. Be careful about using ice, or any teething medication that has a numbing effect, immediately before breastfeeding, as it could make it hard for your baby to latch on properly. Continuing to breastfeed while your baby is teething can really help him to manage the pain, as feeding can be very soothing for him.If you think your baby might be getting frustrated by a low milk supply,seehttps://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-needs-more-milk/It is common to go through a brief spell where your baby feeds more than usual; breastfeeding works by supply and demand, so allowing your baby to feed more often will encourage your body to produce more milk to meet his changing needs.If your nipple or breast is sore because you have been bitten,you could try applying some lanolin or expressed breast milk to the sore area.

"What is a nursing strike?If a baby who has been quite happily breastfeeding suddenly starts to refuse the breast it could be a “nursing strike”. Sometimes this can be mistaken for the baby wanting to stop breastfeeding, but a baby who is ready to wean usually does so over a period of time. In nursing strikes the baby seems unwilling to feed even though he appears really unhappy about it.Something happens which makes your baby not want to feed and it can take time and patience to help them return to the breast. Nursing strikes are nearly always a temporary reaction to something which has happened and the cause may never be discovered.1What might cause a nursing strike?The term nursing strike relates to an older baby who suddenly refuses to feed. If you have a newborn baby who is not feeding, please refer to our article aboutWhen my baby won’t breastfeedfor more information.Sometimes the cause is physical:The baby might have a stuffy nose or earache which is making feeding uncomfortable.They might have a sore throat or mouth. Some mothers have found a little injury such as a cut in their baby’s mouth or an ulcer which hadn’t been noticed.Hand, foot and mouth disease or chickenpox can cause a nursing strike as it is so uncomfortable to feed.They could have sore gums from teething, a thrush infection or even a urinary tract infection.They may be uncomfortable from a vaccination.They might be frustrated at a low milk supply or a change in milk taste due to something the mother has ingested. An oversupply of milk could also sometimes scare a baby who finds the flow overwhelming.Sometimes the cause is emotional:A common cause of a sudden nursing strike is the baby being startled in some way while nursing, perhaps by a loud noise or by a mother involuntarily exclaiming when the baby bites.A mother may have been feeling stressed because of moving house, having visitors, travelling or dealing with a family crisis and put off nursing and the baby senses her distraction.A mother has changed her deodorant, soap, body lotion or perfume and so smells “different” to her baby.A new job may have meant a change in nursing habits or the baby being left with another carer for longer periods of time. Attempts to regulate nursing or offering too many bottles or dummies could also contribute to a baby refusing to breastfeed.What can help end a nursing strike?If illness or injury might be the cause, then consulting a doctor about medication could be useful.Some babies will nurse, sometimes reluctantly, at night. Trying to nurse the baby in their sleep or when they are sleepy can work: it keeps them fed and helps with your milk supply.Trying to force your baby to feed won’t work and a baby will often get upset if a mother tries. Although it’s hard, being relaxed and offering cuddles and skin-to-skin contact helps keep you feeling close.Sing or rock the baby with your shirt open so perhaps they will relax and instinctively latch on.Sitting in a quiet room with dimmed lights and no distractions may help.Try taking a bath together.If you can get help around the house and with other children it means you can spend more time just relaxing with the baby.Try nursing somewhere different, while walking around, using a baby sling, sitting in the car, outside or at a friend’s house.  You can also try a completely different position such as facing you or vertical. Some mothers have tried facing away from a room so that the baby can see what is happening while nursing.Rocking, dancing or doing the “baby bounce” (starting small but getting bouncier and bouncier) while holding him in a nursing position might help. Some babies love this, others don’t.Stimulate your let-down and get your milk flowing before offering the breast so the baby gets an immediate reward. You can also offer the baby something else to suck before offering to nurse so he is in “sucking” mode!If the baby continues to get upset when offered the breast it is sometimes necessary to stop offering for a day or two and let things settle down. You can then make it clear that your breast is available without forcing the issue.See the section below on milk supply for suggestions on preventing a drop in your milk production.If a baby has a sore mouth, some mothers have found offering breastmilk ice lollies before a feed can help to numb the mouth and make nursing more comfortable.  Expressed breastmilk can also be frozen in cubes and offered in a clean cloth/muslin to suck on.  This can be useful for a teething baby. Other mothers have offered a child analgesic as appropriate before trying to nurse.Sometimes these ideas will need to be repeated for a few days before things get back to normal.Here are a couple of unusual ideas to tryOne solution that has worked for some mothers is to sit on an office chair, holding the baby in your lap but not at your breast.  Ask someone to spin the chair around; not too fast but until you feel a little dizzy, and then offer the breast. It seems that being a little disorientated stimulates a natural instinct to go to the breast.Something which has also worked is for the mother to pretend to nurse a doll or cuddly toy, causing the baby to want his comfort back from the intruder!What about my milk supply during a strike?It’s natural to want to give the baby lots of other food and drink while they aren’t nursing. As as long as they are healthy, continue to offer their usual food and water but don’t rush to replace all their nursing needs with extra food immediately.Pumpingorhand expressingwill maintain your milk supplyand help prevent you from getting uncomfortably full, which might lead toplugged ducts or mastitis.If the nursing strike continues for more than a day you can offer expressed milk in a cup, eye-dropper, feeding syringe or spoon. It is best to avoid bottles as they can causenipple confusion.Nursing strikes are distressing for mother and babyIt can be really upsetting and frightening to have a baby who has suddenly lost their main food source, their biggest comfort and a lovely way to fall asleep. You want to comfort your baby but they turn away. It can help to remember that your baby isn’t rejecting you. They don’t understand why breastfeeding is uncomfortable, they just think it is causing discomfort and they are scared to try it again, even if the original problem is sorted out.Almost all nursing strikes are temporary and end happily, although not necessarily quickly. Some mothers have reported nursing strikes that lasted almost three weeks, but more often the baby goes back to breastfeeding in a few days.Even if your baby doesn’t immediately return to the breast you can continue to offer for as long as you want to. If it really does turn out to be the end of breastfeeding, allow yourself to be sad and grieve for its sudden ending. Breastfeeding ideally continues until both the mother and baby are ready to stop, but sometimes the baby makes the decision for you both in spite of a mother’s efforts.  (For more on how it feels after your baby weans, you may find this article helpful:After weaning – what next?)Note:If you have a newborn baby who is refusing to feed this is not a nursing strike.See these posts for help orget support from an LLL Leader:My Baby Won’t BreastfeedSleepy Baby: Why and What To DoJaundiceBeginning BreastfeedingIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, 20171  The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding 8thEdition, pages 407-409.",https://laleche.org.uk/nursing-strikes/,Nursing strikes

Beth bynnag ei bwysau, mae baban ifanc angen nyrsio o leiaf pob 2-3 awr i sefydlu cyflenwad llaeth ei fam ac i gael digon o laeth.Mae nyrsio cyson yn arferol, yn rhannol am fod llaeth y fron yn ddiod yn ogystal â bwyd. Anaml iawn fydd oedolion yn mynd mwy nag ychydig oriau heb ddiod, byrbryd neu bryd. Mae bol eich babi yn fach iawn ac mae llaeth y fron yn cael ei dreulio’n gyflym iawn, felly mae angen bwydo’n gyson i’w helpu i dyfu.Sut i wybod os yw’ch babi’n cael digon o laeth o’r fronMagu pwysauMae babanod newydd-anedig yn aml yn colli hyd at 7% o’u pwysau genedigol yn y dyddiau cyntaf. Unwaith y bydd eich cynhyrchiant llaeth yn cynyddu, fel arfer ar ddiwrnod 3-4, gallwch ddisgwyl i’ch babi ddechrau adennill y pwysau a gollodd. Mae’r rhan fwyaf o fabanod wedi adennill eu pwysau genedigol erbyn 10-14 niwrnod oed. Bydd eich baban yn tyfu dan ei bwysau ei hun, a bydd siart twf yn dangos sut mae’n gwneud (gweler Darllen Pellach). Unwaith y bydd bwydo ar y fron yn mynd yn dda ac nad oes unrhyw bryderon, ni chynghorir pwyso fwy nag unwaith y mis yn y chwe mis cyntaf. Os oes unrhyw bryderon, cadwch lygad ar dueddiadau newid pwysau dros nifer o wythnosau yn hytrach na chanolbwyntio ar un wythnos benodol. Gallai pwysau eich baban godi’n sefydlog a dilyn un llinell ganrannol ar y siart, neu godi’n gynt, gan groesi’r llinellau canrannol. Mae’n annhebyg y bydd cwymp graddol o un llinell ganrannol i’r nesaf (neu bellter cyfatebol) yn broblem oni bai bod ei bwysau yn isel ar gyfer ei oed. Mae twf babanod newydd-anedig trymach yn aml yn ‘arafu’ – sy’n golygu eu bod yn magu pwysau’n araf bach er yn gostwng yn raddol yn erbyn y llinellau canrannol.Mae gostwng yn erbyn y siart yn fwy o ofid ar gyfer babanod pwysau is.

"In the early weeks, it is normal for a baby to “spit-up” and around half of all newborns do, at least once a day.  As a baby’s digestive system matures, this usually decreases and for most mothers it is just a short-term inconvenience.1However, in some babies the valve between the stomach and oesophagus does not close properly. The stomach contents flow back into the oesophagus and can cause vomiting. There are several reasons a baby may vomit and a doctor will need to rule out other causes, but one possible diagnosis is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), also referred to as GOR (gastro-oesophageal reflux).Not all reflux is noticeable and it doesn’t always make a baby uncomfortable, but when it’s severe it can be painful and cause distress to mother and baby.2What are the signs to look out for?A baby may choke and cough, or seem to have a sore throat. Some babies have bad breath.A mother may notice back arching and head turning. The baby may stretch out flat as this reduces pain, instead of snuggling close to his mother.A baby may cry for long periods and be irritable during and after feeds. His cries may sound hoarse. This sometimes leads to a misdiagnosis of colic.A baby may seem to fight feeding or even refuse to feed. There may be poor weight gain.What might help?A few things may help lessen pain. Keeping the baby’s head higher than his bottom during feeding can be more comfortable for him/her. Being at a 30 to 40 degree angle with the baby’s bottom in the mother’s lap and his torso supported on the mother’s crossed leg may be one way for the baby to feed more comfortably. If the baby is feeding in a side-lying position then s/he may feed better on the left side; moving the baby over instead of turning him round if changing sides.  It’s preferable to move the baby to a more upright position as soon as possible.3It can be useful to consider “head above bottom” at all times.A baby sling can be helpful for this purpose. A baby with reflux may find it uncomfortable to lay down flat and might cry or spit up when laid in a cot.Some parents choose to keep their baby in their arms or a sling for naps.Others find it helps to keep their baby upright for a period of time after feeds before they lay them down.Changing the baby on his side may be preferable to avoid putting pressure on his stomach when lifting his legs. A lay-back bouncy seat can be useful. Babies with reflux can find travelling in a car seat uncomfortable due to the pressure on their stomachs and some mothers choose to use the car less while it distresses the baby and instead use public transport while carrying the baby in a sling.As the opening from the stomach to the oesophagus is usually on the right side, keeping the right side higher than the left may also help.Short, frequent feeds ease the incidence and discomfort of reflux.4If a mother has a copious milk supply then feeding one side only at each feed may ease discomfort. However, it is worth looking at what seems to suit your baby.What causes reflux?There are several suggestions as to why reflux happens.  It’s sometimes suggested that it’s caused by an immature sphincter muscle5and that this will strengthen as the baby grows.Other studies have shown a link between reflux and allergies, or an intolerance to cows’ milk protein.6A mother could try to remove dairy products from her diet, in consultation with a medical professional, to see if that improves things.One of the biggest causes can be fast-flowing milk or oversupply.  If a baby seems to be choking or gasping because of a fast flow, there are several things to try.  You can take him off the breast for a moment until the flow slows, or feed in a more upright position.Making sure a baby has a deep latch and good tongue function can also make a difference. Tongue-tie can affect a baby’s sucking action and can lead to a baby swallowing too much air. You can find further suggestions here:https://laleche.org.uk/too-much-milk-and-oversupply/https://laleche.org.uk/tongue-tie/https://laleche.org.uk/unhappy-baby/Adding solids to “thicken feeds” has significant drawbacksIt is sometimes suggested that babies with reflux will be helped by adding solids to their diet to thicken feeds. In 2018, a study in the British Medical Journal reported that “Feed thickeners are commonly used for managing infants with GOR despite the lack of strong supporting evidence”.7As most existing studies assessing the efficacy of thickened feeds on reflux symptoms mainly include formula-fed infants, there is limited information available on the potential reduction of regurgitation in breastfed babies.8Aside from the lack of strong evidence, this treatment has some significant drawbacks. Introducing solid food too early replaces human milk, which is nutritionally ideal for babies, with a food of less nutritional value. It will also lower a mother’s milk supply. Regurgitating solids can add to the baby’s distress and discomfort, and introducing solids too early might also trigger allergies in an already sensitive baby.Switching to formula may not be the answerAlthough it is sometimes suggested that breastfeeding mothers change to formula, this may well worsen symptoms. While both breastfed and formula fed babies can experience reflux, research has shown that formula fed infants have episodes of reflux more often than breastfed babies and they last longer.9As one cause of reflux can be a delayed emptying of the stomach, the fact that human milk leaves the stomach twice as quickly as formula means that breastmilk lessens the possibility of reflux.10If nothing seems to workIf a baby continues to be distressed, then a doctor may refer you to a gastroenterologist who may prescribe medications which can help.Something positive?In hisGuide to Breastfeeding,11Dr. Jack Newman, a member of La Leche League International’s Panel of Professional Advisors, explains how breastmilk is full of immune factors that interact with each other and protect the baby from bacteria, viruses and other micro-organisms.They work by forming a protective layer on a baby’s mucous membranes which line the gut, respiratory tract and other areas. This stops micro-organisms from invading the body through these mucous membranes.Dr. Newman explains that a baby who spits up gets double protection, first when the milk goes down to the stomach, and again when he spits it up.If you would like further help and support look for yournearest LLL group or Leader.You can find further information here:www.llli.org/why-infant-reflux-matters/breastfeeding.support/reflux-in-newborns/Written by Anna Burbidge, LLLGB 20191 Nancy Mohrbacher, “Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple.

"When a mum quits smoking, she’s making one of the biggest changes she can to improve her health, and the health of her baby. Any accurate information that those involved in breastfeeding support can give her, will support her to maintain that change. The hardest time to make or maintain behaviour changes are when one is HALT: hungry, angry, lonely or tired – and new mothers often experience some or all of these.[1]Quitting smokingThere is a persistent myth that abruptly quitting smoking may cause harm. In fact, while it may make symptoms such as coughing worse in the short term, this is a sign that the body’s natural responses are recovering and becoming unsuppressed by the effects of smoking. Additionally, abrupt quit is statistically the most successful way to quit smoking.Many people believe that cutting down will provide protection for themselves and their families, but in fact most people will smoke in a compensatory way – taking more, deeper and longer held drags, thereby maintaining the levels of nicotine and other chemicals inhaled.[2]Therefore, when wanting to quit one should use whatever method of quitting you believe will have the best chance of success in your particular case!Will a baby be harmed by their mother quitting smoking abruptly?No. There is evidence that nicotine exposure prenatally and through breastmilk may cause babies to undergo some symptoms of withdrawal when their mothers stop smoking. However, this must be weighed against the health risks to the baby if the mother continues to smoke. If a mother who is quitting smoking chooses to use nicotine replacement therapy while breastfeeding, her baby will receive a tapering dose of nicotine (as product strength and/or frequency of use is reduced), which could help to minimise withdrawal.[3]The components of cigarette smokeThere are three main problematic components in cigarette smoke: tar (the link between smoking and cancer), carbon monoxide (the link with heart disease, stroke and the main cause of damage in unborn babies) and nicotine.Tar passes from the lungs to the bloodstream and is deposited all around the body. I have searched for information about whether tar passes into breastmilk and haven’t been able to find anything relevant. While it may be present in milk, it will certainly be present in second hand smoke. All information confirms that if a mother cannot quit smoking, then breastfeeding is protective against the chemical exposure the baby will be experiencing.Nicotine in concentrated form is a poison – but when you have been regularly been exposed to it your body develops tolerance – the main problem with it in the form that it is in cigarettes is that it is extremely addictive.If one chooses to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), one is using nicotine in a clean form, a less addictive delivery method (the more quickly it gets to your brain, the more addictive it is, and when smoked it takes less than seven seconds), and lower amounts than if smoking is continued – and with a tapering dosage.(In the UK) all NRT is licensed for use in breastfeeding, with the recommendation that using the intermittent products (gum etc.), instead of the patches, allows mothers to minimise nicotine exposure by timing dosage. Nicotine has a half life of around 90 minutes, so smoking or using NRT just after a feed will allow mothers to minimise the nicotine transmitted to the baby.[4]However – the exposure to a small amount of nicotine is hugely less harmful than exposure to continued smoking, so the mother should do whatever best increases her chances of success.When choosing to use NRT, caregivers need to be aware that what is a therapeutic amount of nicotine for them would be a significant overdose for someone who is not used to it – in fact, the residue left in discarded NRT would be enough to cause harm to a baby or child. Occasionally, patches become unstuck from their original owner in bed and stuck on  to other people sharing the space – apparently a part used patch or a piece of gum can make an adult feel like they are having a heart attack, so the effect on a baby would be severe. Just as smoking materials are kept out of reach, pre- and post- use NRT needs to be kept securely away from babies and children.Electronic cigarettes (or vaping)Public Health England has recently released an evidence summary relating to e-cigarettes. Its conclusion is that current evidence indicates that using an e-cigarette is around 95% safer than a conventional cigarette.[5]Using an e-cigarette will not expose a baby to tar or carbon monoxide. Ambient levels of nicotine are much reduced compared with that in the air or household surfaces of a household where cigarette smoking takes place. This is because 85% of smoke released by cigarettes is sidestream smoke – the smoke that is released by a burning cigarette when it is not being smoked.E-cigarettes are regulated by general consumer products law which is enforced by trading standards – this means it is easier for companies to bring products to market with much less testing and control than if products were regulated as medicines – it’s responsive rather than proactive. If you are going to use an e-cigarette, choose one that has a kitemark or CE mark as that gives you a guarantee that what it says on the label is what is in it, and the electrical components are safe.[6]The vapour itself is usually made from propylene glycol and glycerine – and as far as we know that doesn’t cause anything more serious than occasional throat irritation. There is a need for research on long term lung exposure safety.E-cigarettes come in a range of flavours including menthol – peppermint oil is sometimes associated with reduced milk supply. If you are concerned you might check your preferred brand to see if it actually contains peppermint oil or a synthetic. Menthol cigarettes are linked to higher rates of lung cancer, but that is because the mint numbs the throat, enabling smoke to be drawn in deeper/ held longer. That wouldn’t be an issue with e-cigarettes.ASH (Action on Smoking and Health) have a good online factsheet giving an introduction to e-cigarettes:http://ash.org.uk/search/?q=e%20cigarette&x=0&y=0NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) now takes a harm reduction approach to e-cigarettes – they cannot recommend an unlicensed product, but are clear that they are less harmful than smoking. We know that many women quit smoking when pregnant and lapse after their baby has been born.[7]If a mum who has quit smoking conventional cigarettes and is now using an e-cigarette, her baby isn’t being exposed to the chemicals in smoke – she has to weigh up how she feels about maintaining her successful quit versus risk of lapse if she stops using it.Co-sleeping and smoking or vapingMaternal (and to a lesser extent paternal or other parent present in the bed) smoking has long been clearly linked to increased risk of SIDS. Exposure to nicotine damages babies’ ability to develop normal robust neurological processes to protect their breathing and respond if it is compromised. It also decreases lung function and increases sleep related respiratory problems. According to evidence examined by the WHO, it is unclear how much of this risk is down to tobacco smoking during pregnancy damaging the foetus’s development, and how much is down to exposure to second hand smoke after birth.[8]This has implications for where babies sleep when their mothers smoked during pregnancy, even if the mother quit smoking at (or before) birth and is not now smoking. Additionally, sleep changes related to smoking such as apnoeas may take time to resolve after quitting smoking, and these may make the mother less responsive to her baby.Cannabis and breastfeedingMost times, cannabis is smoked together with tobacco – this means that all the health impact of tobacco is present, only with the additional effect that when joints are smoked, each inhalation is usually taken deeper and held for longer. This increases the lung exposure to harm. Because of the higher levels of oil in cannabis, it is usually estimated that each joint smoked is the equivalent of 5-7 cigarettes.[9]The effects of cannabis in breastmilk on babies’ development are controversial. Some studies indicate that there is no impact on babies’ long term development, others find that motor development at the age of one is slightly reduced in babies who were regularly exposed.[10]Additionally, most babies who are exposed to THC (see below) via breastmilk will also have been exposed foetally, making it difficult to determine what changes have occurred when.[11]The active intoxicant in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – this is fat soluble, is stored in the body’s fat reserves and transfers into breastmilk. The immediate effects on babies can be sedation, weakness and poor feeding pattern.[12]Because THC is stored and released slowly, among heavy, regular cannabis users the levels of THC in breastmilk can be eight times the levels in blood serum.A mother who is intoxicated by cannabis use will sleep more deeply – plus her baby will also face the raised SIDS risk factors relating to tobacco use. Therefore co-sleeping would be clearly contraindicated.Cannabis suppresses prolactin production, which may affect milk production. There is some evidence of this in animal studies, however human studies have found no difference in weaning age between cannabis using and non-cannabis using mothers.[13][14]If breastfeeding is well established, then prolactin suppression may not affect breastmilk production.Researchers are divided on whether the risks to the baby of cannabis exposure – including currently unidentified long-term developmental risks – are outweighed by the protective effects of breastmilk. Effects are dose-related, meaning that the risks to an infant of occasional exposure are very different to those who are regularly and chronically exposed.[15]ShishaShisha or waterpipe smoking involves flavoured tobacco being placed on a disk of charcoal which is then lit. The smoke is drawn through water and into the mouth. Sometimes tobacco free preparations are smoked via a waterpipe. The burning of charcoal produces a dense smoke containing a lot of carbon monoxide. Additionally, sessions are often long. These effects combined mean that in one shisha session you can absorb the equivalent amount of smoke as in 100 cigarettes.[16]Anyone wanting to decide whether their shisha smoking was affecting their baby via breastmilk would need to consider whether the exposure was one-off or long term. With occasional use, mothers would need to think about whether their co-sleeping risk was temporarily increased while they were affected by carbon monoxide.Written by Rebecca Coyle, edited by Ruth LewisOriginally published in LLLGB’s Leader publicationFEEDBACKCopyright LLLGB 2016Further readingSmoking and breastfeedinghttps://laleche.org.uk/smoking-breastfeeding/Marijuana and breastfeedinghttp://breastfeeding.support/smoking-weed-while-breastfeeding/[1]http://www.chinnstreetcounseling.com/zomerland/zomerland_11.shtml[2]http://www.ncsct.co.uk/usr/pub/Briefing%202.pdf[3]http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/15340/SPC/NiQuitin+21+mg+transdermal+patches[4]https://www.health-e-learning.com/resources/articles/40-social-drugs-and-breastfeeding[5]https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-an-evidence-update[6]http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2015/july/E-cigarettes-guidance-published/[7]http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/gender/en_tfi_gender_women_pregnancy_postpartum_smoking_cessation.pdf[8]http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/mitchell.pdf[9]http://www.nhs.uk/news/2012/06june/Pages/cannabis-lung-health-risks-underestimated.aspx[10]http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~HqAUxb:1[11]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809366/?tool=pubmed[12]http://www.health-e-learning.com/resources/articles/40-social-drugs-and-breastfeeding[13]http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~HqAUxb:1[14]http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~HqAUxb:1[15]http://www.health-e-learning.com/resources/articles/40-social-drugs-and-breastfeeding[16]https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/risk-factors/smoking/shisha",https://laleche.org.uk/smoking-vaping-cannabis-breastfeeding/,"Smoking, Vaping, Cannabis and Breastfeeding"
"From the early days with your newborn, breastfeeding often becomes a very important and comfortable part of your relationship with your child. As well as continuing to provide important nutrients and protection against ill health, it’s a wonderful way to continue to connect with and comfort your growing infant, both during the day and quite often at night too.1In fact, night nursing is a biologically normal behaviour.2However, as time goes by and your baby’s teeth come in, a new concern may emerge. You may be told by your dentist that breastfeeding causes tooth decay and some dentists may advise early weaning from the breast, or at least no night-time nursing.In this article we look at questions and concerns about dental health and discuss how it can be protected while you and your baby continue to enjoy your important breastfeeding relationship.Is it true that breastfeeding will contribute to my child’s tooth decay?Does the research show I should wean after one to prevent tooth decay?How does diet affect dental health?How can I ensure good dental hygiene?What if my dentist tells me I should stop breastfeeding?Do studies show human milk may protect against bacteria?Are some children more susceptible to dental caries?What can I take from all this information?Is it true that breastfeeding will contribute to my child’s tooth decay?Studies show that a breastfed child is significantly less likely to suffer from tooth decay (dental caries) than a child who is formula fed. According to a report issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in January 2020, “Evidence suggests that infants who are breastfed in the first year of life have lower levels of dental caries than those fed infant formula.”3The report adds:“One systematic review suggested a higher risk of ECC [early childhood caries] when breastfeeding extends beyond one year of age, but the data analysis did not control adequately for important confounders such as intake of sugars from other sources.”4As well as the continuing significance to the health of mother and child, breastfeeding promotes optimal jaw and tooth development. A breastfed child is less likely to suffer from crooked teeth (malocclusion)5and the longer the child is breastfed the greater the reduction in risk. A breastfed baby may also be protected from developing dental fluorosis (discolouration of teeth).6Does the research show I should wean after one to prevent tooth decay?There is no convincing evidence to show that breastfeeding itself is causing problems or that stopping will prevent tooth decay. Studies often look at the effects of lactose (milk sugar, which is also present in breastmilk) on teeth, not the effects of breastmilk as a whole, with its antibacterial properties, helpful enzymes and high pH.Research about the impact of breastfeeding on dental health after the age of one acknowledges that it is difficult to adequately control other factors such as diet, dental hygiene, and the presence of bacteria in the mouth, when looking atearly childhood caries.In December 2018, Public Health England said that there are no good quality studies proving links between dental damage and breastfeeding beyond 12 months. Their guidance also emphasises the risks of not breastfeeding.7Other reports agree that research may not take into account diet alongside breastfeeding. A 2019 review entitled ‘Breastfeeding and early childhood caries. Review of the literature, recommendations, and prevention’ states that results from heterogeneous studies “do not always take into account contradictory factors such as eating habits of the mother or infant (feeding during the night, number of meals per day, eating sweet foods etc.), dental hygiene, or the sociocultural context.”8Another 2019 report entitled ‘Systematic Review of Evidence Pertaining to Factors That Modify Risk of Early Childhood Caries’9looked at breastfeeding and childhood caries in children aged up to 72 months. It concluded that breastfeeding for up to 24 months did not increase early childhood caries risk, although there was some “low-quality” evidence for increased risk in longer duration breastfeeding. The review added that some data indicated the impact of sugars in complementary foods increased risk.An older US study from 2007, ‘Association between infant breastfeeding and early childhood caries in the United States’,10assessed the potential risk factors for dental caries in 1,576 children aged 2-5 years old and demonstrated that there is no evidence to suggest that breastfeeding or its duration are risk factors for early childhood caries, severe early childhood caries, or decayed and filled surfaces on primary teeth.How does diet affect dental health?Current studies indicate that research cannot rule out our modern diet as a cause of dental problems rather than breastfeeding. Today’s diet includes many more cavity-inducing foods and it can be hard to get all those sugars off your child’s teeth.Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is an oral bacterium that’s especially hard on tooth enamel in the presence of sugar. Babies can pick up S. mutans from adults who carry the strain and who share food, utensils or mouth kisses with them; therefore it is important that the primary caregiver of a baby also maintains good oral health. Although your dentist may advise you to stop breastfeeding at night to prevent your baby or toddler from developing cavities, these factors are much more likely to play a role in your child’s dental health, making night weaning an irrelevant solution to the problem.11The importance of taking into account the overall diet of a breastfed infant is highlighted in a 2014 study from the University of California, ‘Association of long-duration breastfeeding and dental caries estimated with marginal structural models’, looking at possible links between longer-term breastfeeding and the risk of tooth decay and cavities.12Although the research found evidence of a greater risk of severe early tooth decay the more frequently a mother breastfed her child beyond the age of 24 months during the day, the author, Benjamin Chaffee, made positive comments about breastfeeding saying that the study does not suggest that breastfeeding causes caries and that the N. 1 priority for breastfeeding mothers should be ensuring their babies’ optimal nutrition.The authors speculated that it is possible that breastmilk in conjunction with excess refined sugar in modern foods may be contributing to the greater tooth decay seen in babies breastfed the longest and most often. This study also talks about “breastmilk bottles” as opposed to breastfeeds and highlights that nearly half the children had also been given infant formula by six months.A 2020 Australian study13also looked at diet and dental health in pre-schoolers by studying breastfeeding patterns and the intake of free sugars in their diet. The authors concluded that “Breastfeeding practices were not associated with early childhood caries. Given the wide-ranging benefits of breastfeeding, and the low prevalence of sustained breastfeeding in this study and Australia in general, recommendations to limit breastfeeding are unwarranted, and breastfeeding should be promoted in line with global and national recommendations. To reduce the prevalence of early childhood caries, improved efforts are needed to limit foods high in free sugars.”14How can I ensure good dental hygiene?The overwhelming conclusion when looking at breastfeeding and dental health is that, alongside diet, dental and oral hygiene is crucial in preventing cavities.The 2019 report entitled ‘Systematic Review of Evidence Pertaining to Factors That Modify Risk of Early Childhood Caries’15concluded that “Providing access to fluoridated water and educating caregivers are justified approaches to ECC prevention. Limiting sugars in bottles and complementary foods should be part of this education.”16Chaffee, the author of the 2014 study ‘Association of long-duration breastfeeding and dental caries estimated with marginal structural models’17said his team of researchers collected data on tooth brushing habits, but did not investigate a specific link between cleaning teeth after the last feeding and caries. He added that anything that removes carbohydrates and sugars from the oral cavity should help prevent tooth decay.An often-quoted 2015 study ‘Breastfeeding and the risk of dental caries: a systematic review and meta-analysis’ commented that “There was a lack of studies on children aged >12 months simultaneously assessing caries risk in breastfed, bottle-fed and children not bottle or breastfed.”18It also concluded that when infants were no longer exclusively breastfed or formula fed, confounding factors such as diet and tooth brushing practices needed to be taken into account. The authors stated that “further research with careful control of pertinent confounding factors is needed to elucidate this issue and better inform infant feeding guidelines.”19Public Health England’s recommendations are that parents or carers should brush their children’s teeth:as soon as they erupt;twice a day;last thing at night (or before bedtime) and on one other occasion;with a toothpaste containing at least 1000 ppm fluoride;using only a smear of toothpaste.There seems to be general agreement that the best way to aid your child’s dental health is to brush their teeth thoroughly at least twice a day with fluoridated toothpaste. It might also help to encourage your baby to swish with, or at least sip, water after eating solid foods. Some dentists recommend wiping a child’s teeth after each nursing, including during the night, but this can prove to be a difficult and unnecessary procedure.While there is no need to keep your child from nursing at night, it is important to brush teeth before going to sleep and not to offer any carbohydrates after that. This is in line with the findings of a 1999 study which investigated the effect of different solutions on dental health by immersing healthy, extracted teeth in them. The results showed that breastmilk alone was practically identical to water and did not cause tooth decay. However, when a small amount of sugar was added to the breastmilk, the mixture was worse than a sugar solution when it came to causing tooth decay.20You may also want to ask your dentist for information about using xylitol. This is a natural carbohydrate sugar substitute that interferes with bacteria’s ability to stick to the tooth surface. Aside from being available as a cooking ingredient, xylitol is often found in chewing gum and it’s possible that its use by mothers with high levels of S.Mutans may reduce the level of bacteria in their mouths, consequently lowering the risk of passing S.Mutans to their baby.21In summary, breastfeeding, when accompanied by toothbrushing and better nutrition by reducing the frequency and consumption of sugary foods, continues to contribute significantly to well-being for many mothers and infants. Regular consultation with a dentist for examination and preventive advice regarding dietary practices (especially sugar intake), oral hygiene, or supplementary fluoride is recommended.What if my dentist tells me I should stop breastfeeding?While dentists are naturally concerned about oral health, they may not have a lot of training on the overall significance of breastfeeding to the short- and long-term physical and mental health of both mother and child.According to the 2018 Public Health England guidance on Breastfeeding and dental health, “Breastfeeding is the physiological norm against which other behaviours are compared; therefore, dental teams should promote breastfeeding and include in their advice the risks of not breastfeeding to general and oral health.”22The guidance states that dentists and their teams should support evidence-based guidelines from the WHO and the UK government and in a core message to dental teams and healthcare professionals includes the following recommendations:“Dental teams should continue to support and encourage mothers to breastfeed.”“Not being breastfed is associated with an increased risk of infectious morbidity (for example gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, middle-ear infections).”“Breastfeeding up to 12 months of age is associated with a decreased risk of tooth decay.”If your dentist would like further advice, the UKHSA refers them to ‘Health Matters: Child Dental Health’ (2017)23and ‘Delivering Better Oral Health: An Evidence-Based Toolkit for Prevention’ (2014).24There are supportive dentists who understand the significance of breastfeeding so if you are under pressure to wean, try to find one who respects your choices.Do studies show human milk may protect against bacteria?The late Dr. Brian Palmer, DDS studied children’s skulls that were thousands of years old and he found almost no cavities. In his presentations, he referred to evidence from anthropologists and commented that “If breastmilk caused decay – evolution would have selected against it. It would be evolutionary suicide for breastmilk to cause decay.”25One reason for the lack of cavities identified by Dr. Palmer may be that the mechanics of breastfeeding make it unlikely for human milk to stay in the baby’s mouth for long. During breastfeeding, the nipple is drawn deep within the baby’s mouth, and milk is literally squirted into the back of it. The nursing child must swallow before he can go on to the next step of the suckling process. In contrast, baby bottles can drip milk, juice, or formula into the baby’s mouth even if he is not actively sucking. If the baby does not swallow, the liquid can pool in the front of the mouth around the teeth. The artificial nipple is very short, so the liquid in the bottle is likely to pass over teeth before being swallowed.Another reason is that bacteria which cause cavity formations are inhibited by several components of human milk including high pH levels. IgA and IgG have the potential to retard streptococcal growth, and S. mutans is highly susceptible to the bactericidal action of lactoferrin, an active component of human milk.26Human milk also actively strengthens teeth by depositing calcium and phosphorus on them.Dr. Palmer was of the opinion that dry mouth is another factor that can increase the incidence of early childhood caries. Saliva, which helps maintain normal pH, is not produced as much at night, especially among those who breathe through their mouths. An infant or toddler who nurses often at night continues to produce saliva, which may help combat dry mouth.Are some children more susceptible to dental caries?In a survey entitled ‘Prolonged, on-demand Breastfeeding and Dental Caries – An Investigation’,27Dr. Harry Torney found that four factors were significantly associated with the high caries group. The most significant relationship was with defective enamel while the other three factors related to events that had occurred while the child was in utero. One of these was maternal stress and/or bereavement as reported by the mother. Another was a reduced intake of dairy products as estimated retrospectively by the mother. The third factor was medically diagnosed illness in the mother. If a mother’s pre-natal diet and/or antibiotics received during pregnancy have affected the quality of a child’s tooth enamel and resistance to cavities, the permanent teeth are almost always fine. Diet and oral hygiene are also factors, as confirmed by the more recent research discussed above.Dr. Torney found no correlation between the onset of dental caries under two years of age and breastfeeding patterns such as feeding to sleep, frequent night feeds, etc. In his opinion, under normal circumstances, the antibodies in breastmilk counteract the mouth bacteria which cause tooth decay. However, in the presence of small enamel defects, the teeth become more vulnerable, and the protective effect of breastmilk is not sufficient to counteract bacteria combined with the sugars in the milk.According to this research, a baby who is exclusively breastfed (no supplemental bottles, juice, or solids) will not have decay unless he is genetically predisposed, i.e. soft or no enamel. In a baby who does have a genetic problem, weaning will not slow down the rate of decay and may speed it up due to lack of lactoferrin.28Dr. Palmer’s research is in line with this: “Human milk alone does not cause dental caries. Infants exclusively breastfed are not immune to decay due to other factors that impact the infant’s risk for tooth decay. Decay causing bacteria (streptococcus mutans) is transmitted to the infant by way of parents, caregivers, and others.29A couple of studies have also highlighted a possible association between early childhood caries and maternal Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy.3031What can I take from all this information?While you may initially feel concerned about the effects of longer-term and nighttime breastfeeding, it is important to look at all the factors contributing to the dental health of your breastfed child.Historically children who nursed all night had little or no decay until the advent of decay-inducing foods.Human milk alone rarely contributes to decay and actually has tooth-strengthening properties. While parents need to be aware of the dangers of sweet foods and drinks and of the benefits of strict oral hygiene and visits to the dentist, it’s important not to overlook the impact on physical and emotional health of breastfeeding for the baby, family and society as a whole.The WHO recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health and then continue breastfeeding for up to two years of age and beyond, alongside complementary foods.When using the evolution of other primates as a comparison point for humans, it is interesting to notice that in human babies breastfeeding would be expected to continue for at least two and a half years. Anthropologist Kathy Dettwyler states that while“it is meaningless, statistically, to speak of an average age of weaning world- wide”32anthropologists have found that children naturally wean between two and a half years and around seven years of age.Weaning from the breast before you and your baby are ready because of unsubstantiated fears of tooth decay would be denying both of you of the many positive outcomes from continued breastfeeding and may lead to the unnecessary introduction of bottles.The research discussed above shows that there is no need to night wean your child to take care of their dental health. Adopting a good oral hygiene regimen, using fluoridated toothpaste and consuming a low-sugar diet are likely to have a much more significant impact in terms of reducing the risk ofearly childhood caries.Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, July 2022Other online Information:https://breastfeeding.support/breastfeeding-and-tooth-decay/https://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/tooth-decay/https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/phe-statement-breastfeeding-and-dental-health/breast-feeding-and-tooth-decay-infographic/References:1.https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-beyond-a-year/2.https://laleche.org.uk/reasons-night-waking-biological-norm/3.World Health Organization.

"La Leche League GB is not a pressure group. Our wish is to offer parents accurate information so that they can make informed decisions that feel right for themselves and their child.Breastmilk is the optimal food for babies, as it is uniquely made up of the exact nutrients needed for each individual baby for at least the first six months.  New discoveries are still being made about the way various components of breastmilk work to aid the growth and development of babies.However there are times when, due to individual circumstances, mothers are unable to breastfeed or feel it is really not for them. Then what is important to a child is the love, care, warmth and bonding they experience.  LLL Leaders can provide a listening ear for parents to talk about their feelings and concerns, enabling them to discuss the situation with someone who will be completely non-judgmental. We don’t offer advice, as every mother/baby relationship is unique and what is right for one will not be right for another, butwe offer information to empower parents to make a decision that is right for them.If an LLL Leader has any concern about the health of a baby, we will suggest the mother contact a health professional. We also understand thatthere are occasions when offering supplementation, alongside breastfeeding support, is important for a baby’s health.LLL accredited Leaders have breastfed their own babies, but many of us first contacted LLL because of difficulties with feeding, or because we had previously stopped breastfeeding a baby before we wanted to. LLL Leaders know that when a mother needs a bit of help, it can’t wait until tomorrow. We offer mother to mother support viagroups,phone callsandemailsand have a range ofonline support options.While we do represent the views of breastfeeding families in any discussions on breastfeeding, both in the media and via government committees, as well as organisations such asNICE(National Institute for Clinical Excellence) and theBFLG(Baby Feeding Law Group), we will never try to persuade a mother to breastfeed.Breastfeeding provides babies with everything they need, but motherswho don’t breastfeed will find the way that suits them to nourish and cherish their child. The most important thing is that parents feel they have been able to make an informed choice and do what is right for them in their personal situation.Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGBFurther readingMy baby needs more milkNursing supplementersSharing BreastmilkWhen breastfeeding ends suddenlyRelactation & Induced Lactation",https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-isnt-working-2/,When breastfeeding isn’t working
"One of the questions new parents are often asked is “Is he sleeping through the night yet?” Because formula-fed babies are perceived as sleeping for longer, mothers with night-waking babies can feel pressured to offer formula to try to encourage longer periods of sleep.Social expectations are defining infant needsDr. James J. McKenna, Director of the Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame and member of La Leche League International’s Health Advisory Council,has stated in previous discussions about night waking that he wonders if parental expectations have been determined by social ideologies and social ‘wish lists’, which have little to do with who babies are biologically. By expecting babies to sleep through the night, parents are defining infant needs in terms of who we want them to become and notions as to how, for example, to make them ‘independent’ at young ages.Night waking is caused by a variety of reasonsDr. McKenna says that infant waking can be related to breathing patterns. Sleep apnoea (a temporary inability to breathe) can induce protective awakenings and infants who spend more time in deeper sleep do not arouse so easily in order to prevent a life-threatening apnoea. (i)Dr. Mckenna adds that it is known that babies that die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) likely had some kind of arousal deficiency (did not arouse sufficiently well enough). He states that externally induced arousals (sleeping near to mother) might also improve awakening skills; this is important “since infantile cardio-pulmonary perturbations are corrected by the infant arousing from sleep that leads to oxygenation. Arousing is an infant’s best defense against a range of potential physiological challenges”.(ii)McKenna speculates that perhaps mothers evolved to induce arousals (to have their babies feed) as, for several reasons, lots of arousals may increase an infant’s chance for survival. It may also help protect mothers from a variety of diseases, including breast and ovarian cancers.  Dr. McKenna says infants are not always waking for food, but also for non-nutritive purposes, such as to be cuddled and touched, and possibly reassured emotionally. Night waking is often determined and/or regulated “by way of changing growth, metabolic and developmental caloric requirements, and likely by the infant’s own personality characteristics” (iii)Feeling TiredFrequent night waking to breastfeed poses a significant challenge to mother’s sleep, but feeding a baby formula milk which over-rides its instinct to wake could create other problems.Night feeds are important as they help to establish and maintain your milksupply and help to avoid engorgement, blocked ducts and mastitis. Breastfeeding is sometimes blamed for a mother’s tiredness, but caring for a new baby is often tiring, independent of the way a baby is fed. It can help to try to sleep or rest when the baby does, even if it’s not a time when you would normally nap. Sitting down to breastfeed means you get a chance to relax and put your feet up.Studies have shown that when mothers stop breastfeeding their fatigue level does not change. One US study also found that breastfeeding mothers averaged 40-45 minutes more sleep at night during the first three months than those formula feeding, even when fathers helped out with giving bottles.(iv, v)Investing in breastfeeding supportWhile formula manufacturers can invest a lot of money into promoting their product and may suggest that it will help babies to sleep better, there are limited funds available to provide women with information and support about breastfeeding. Much of the support women receive comes from charities relying on voluntary breastfeeding supporters.According to the NHS 2010 Infant Feeding Survey (IFS), breastfeeding initiation rates in GB remain around 80%, but there is still a very rapid drop-off rate. The majority of women who stop breastfeeding in the early weeks would have liked to continue longer and lack of information and support with initial difficulties is a key problem. (vi)Given that the vast majority of women wish to breastfeed, there is a strong need for additional investment in breastfeeding support when women need it and a clearer understanding of the way breastmilk offers optimal growth and protection for babies.When making decisions about infant feeding, it can help to know that it is normal for a baby to wake at night and how lots of arousals can in fact protect the baby. Understanding that “sleeping through the night” is something which will happen when the baby is developmentally ready allows women to make an informed decision without feeling pressured into introducing formula.Written by Anna Burbidge on behalf of La Leche League GB, July 2016Further readingi.

"Breastfeeding in emergency situations is usually talked about in relation to disasters which have occurred in countries outside of the UK.  However unexpected crises can happen anywhere at any time.In emergency situations breastfeeding provides a mother with the ability to nourish her child whatever circumstances they are in. Human milk contains all the nutrients a baby needs, along with antibodies to help fight infection and disease. Hormones contained in breastmilk can help to lower stress levels in both mother and baby, and breastfeeding provides warmth and comfort.Support for continuing breastfeedingIn an emergency a priority would be to get as many babies as possible being breastfed by their own mothers. Mothers who are breastfeeding need reassurance that even if they are hungry and stressed they can still breastfeed and can offer the breast as much as the baby wants.  If a baby is ill breastmilk is quickly absorbed and helps fight sickness1. If a mother is ill antibodies in her milk will help protect her baby2.It is sometimes not realised that mothers who have not been breastfeeding can be encouraged to put the baby to the breast to initiate re-lactation. It can take a little time and effort but with the right support breastmilk can be produced again. A baby might be wrapped in a sling or blanket to give skin-to-skin contact and a little privacy while the mother tries this.  Although the amount will be limited at first frequent nursing will build up the supply. Find more information about relactation and induced lactationhere.Formula feeding in an emergency is difficultA good way of supporting breastfeeding mothers in any emergency situation is to keep them supplied with adequate food, water and ways to keep warm, along with baby clothes and nappies. Routine distribution of infant formula should be avoided. Formula feeding in an emergency is difficult, does not offer protection against illness and can be dangerous if it is not possible to prepare properly. Powdered formulas are not sterile and should only be used where water can be sterilised by boiling, and human milk is not an option. Local water supplies may have been compromised and bottled water should be used with care as some varieties have too high a level of minerals for babies. Bottles and teats are very difficult to adequately clean and feeding cups may be a better alternative.Breastfeeding in a traumatic situationDuring unexpected emergencies such as floods families may find they face power cuts, water shortages and even sudden evacuation from the comforts of their home. A breastfeeding mother needs no equipment to feed her baby and more importantly she has the knowledge that food for her baby will be readily available whenever needed and wherever she is, and will actively protect her baby while they are in a very traumatic situation.Where to find further informationFind support with breastfeedinghere.List of resources in different languageshttps://llli.org/breastfeeding-info/infant-feeding-emergencies-multilingual/1https://laleche.org.uk/amazing-milk/2https://laleche.org.uk/when-a-mother-is-ill/",https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-emergency-situations/,Breastfeeding in Emergency Situations
"One of the biggest adjustments a new mother may have to make is to realise that babies can need their mothers twenty-four hours a day. From the moment a woman gives birth she can find herself bombarded with a vast array of ideas and suggestions, and this can lead to confusion on what she might expect.In particular, where, when and how much a baby should sleep is the subject of much confusion and contradiction.Parents may have been given unrealistic information on how much a baby will sleep, and their expectations might not be developmentally or physically appropriate.The baby may be labelled as having a sleep problem when, in fact, he is exhibiting normal behaviour.Questionable methodology of studies which suggest babies should be left to cryLLLGB disagrees with the methodological approach and the conclusions of a study from Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, which was recently published in the journal Pediatrics.1The researchers studied 43 sets of parents, with babies between 6 and 16 months, who felt their child was having problems sleeping. They divided the group into three sets: one group was asked to leave the child and wait longer and longer before going back to comfort him (graduated extinction); the second group was able to stay in the room until the child dozed off (bedtime fading); and the control group did not attempt any sleep training.After three months, the researchers found that the babies in the first two groups fell asleep more quickly and woke less during the night. They tested for levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, and found that babies had lower levels during sleep training interventions at the time they were tested. Moreover, one year after the interventions, parents didn’t report more behavioural problems compared with the babies in the control group. Michael Gradisar, Associate Professor of Psychology at Flinders University, said there was no evidence that “crying it out” was stressful for babies, and that he believed it gave peace of mind surrounding bedtime.2This study echoes research led by Psychology Professor Marsha Weinraub of Temple University in Philadelphia, published in Developmental Psychology in November 2012.3Weinraub was quoted as welcoming the Flinders study and she said that the gains in sleep would help both babies and parents. She added that the most important aspect of the study is that both sleep training techniques seem safe for babies in the short and long term, and that the study disproves expert opinions about the detrimental long-term effects of sleep training methods in terms of children’s stress levels and problematic behaviours. However, Professor Gradisar himself mentioned that while sleep training appears to improve sleep without detriment on the child or family, more independent trials are needed to validate the findings of his study.4Measuring StressNew parents who are feeling sleep deprived and are confused on whether to leave their baby to cry could be misguided by this new research, and it is therefore important to stress that when the study is looked at in detail, the results are not as positive as they may at first seem.In order to measure the babies’ stress, the researchers tested their levels of cortisol, but these tests were done in the morning, and there is no way of knowing just how stressed the babies were while they were crying themselves to sleep, or if their sleep would have been any different if they had fallen asleep in a calm state. In addition, when follow-up tests for cortisol levels and to gather sleep data were conducted at 1 and 3 months, only 28 and 23 participants respectively out of the initial 43 were included in the study. Although the full 43 participants were included in the 12 months follow-up tests, the small numbers in the various groups could mean that any differences and effects might not have been detected. The study also neglected to record data such as the babies’ feeding method, sleep arrangements, and if they were in any sort of day care.5Claims that babies need to crySome popular baby care manuals in the first half of the 1900s gave mothers a very unrealistic idea of how much babies needed to sleep, and some of the baby ‘experts’ of that era were convinced that babies needed to cry. It was thought that a baby’s lungs didn’t fully expand unless they were exercised every day. Mothers were terrified with the tale of a baby who died of pneumonia at the age of 8 months because he had never been allowed to cry.6Leaving babies to cry because it is supposedly good for them is a long way from the calmness we aim for today, and yet, some modern day ‘gurus’ still cling to this idea. In her recently republished book, The Baby Book, maternity nurse Rachel Waddilove says she teaches mothers that it is ok for babies to cry. In a comment which could be an echo of the misinformed statements of the 20th century, she says: “Very often a baby’s normal way to go to sleep is to have a shout, air their lungs. If you rush to them you interrupt the pattern of them falling asleep”.7It would be considered very distressing for an adult to cry themselves to sleep each night, and the same is true for a vulnerable baby calling out for his parents in the only way he can.Leaving a baby to cry may, possibly, give short-term relief to the family who may get a better night’s rest. However,there are many studies which disagree strongly with the claim that leaving a baby to cry is not stressful. The 1999 Ontario Early Years Study8explains how the brain is being hard-wired in early development and how the patterns which emerge will last for a lifetime. How the adult brain reacts to stress is influenced by this early development, and adults who were stressed as babies can have abnormal stress reactions in later life, as well as a greater vulnerability to social attachment disorders.In 1998, Harvard research showed that babies who cried excessively were susceptible to stress as adults, and sensitive to future trauma.9Chronic stress in infancy can also lead to an over-active adrenaline system, causing anti-social and aggressive behavior, and even affect physical illness far into the future.While the Flinders study claims to have found no ill effects, the participants would need to be monitored for many years into the future for this to be clearer.On the other hand, research has shown that infants and toddlers who experienced responsive and sensitive care tend to develop into socially competent pre-schoolers.10Are there any sleep training gains?The Flinders study found that, after three months, babies in the cry-it-out group fell asleep almost 15 minutes faster than babies in the control group, and those in the bedtime fading group went to sleep about 12 minutes faster. Commenting on the Flinders study, Professor Weinraub said: “When you are waiting for your baby to go to sleep, every minute counts”11, but this assumes that the time spent with a baby is something to be wished away. The Flinders study also found that, one year after the interventions, babies in all three groups had about the same amount of sleep because sleep health improves naturally as babies get older. This would seem to indicate that babies would have started sleeping more without any intervention.It is not easy for mothers to leave their baby to cry. It isn’t meant to be. A baby’s cry is intended to elicit a response from its caregiver. It is extremely distressing for a mother to listen to her baby calling for her and yet to believe that not responding is the best thing for their child, even when it seems so wrong.Leaving a breastfed baby to cry may alter normal feeding patterns, and unnaturally longer sleep patterns may affect the protection regular waking gives babies in regulating their breathing. There seems to be very little gained by leaving a baby to cry, and a very small, short-term increase in sleep time would have to be balanced against the stress caused to both parents and infants.“Self-soothing”Many proponents of sleep training claim that it is really important for babies to learn to fall asleep on their own. Professor Weinraub says: “When mothers tune in to these night time awakenings and/or if a baby is in the habit of falling asleep during breastfeeding, then he or she may not be learning how to self-soothe, something that is critical for regular sleep”.12While babies may indeed stop crying if left unattended long enough, they are not learning to self-soothe, they are simply giving up on the hope that comfort will come. The term “self-soothing” was invented in the 1970s during previous research by Dr. Thomas Anders, but it has come to be adopted as a fact rather than a research term, with far more meaning than was intended. There is no way of knowing if, when babies stop crying, they have fallen asleep or have simply gone into a “withdrawn” state where they have given up hope of being responded to.13It’s interesting to note that adults in relationships enjoy being close to each other and sleeping in the same bed. It is comforting to wake in the night and feel the presence of someone we love next to us. It raises the question of why a baby or child should be expected to sleep alone, left to cry and “self-soothe” when adults aren’t.Should babies be expected to sleep through the night?The Flinders study assumes it is normal to expect babies to sleep through the night by themselves by a certain age. However, in many cultures, co-sleeping and breastfeeding are the norm. The idea of putting a baby to sleep in his own room alone has only been considered normal in industrialised Western societies over the last hundred years or so. We may have changed our expectations of what is normal, but a baby’s need for his mother’s milk and proximity to her body remains the same.Professor James McKenna of the University Of Notre Dame, Indiana, says that human babies are born developmentally immature and require parental (especially maternal) smell, touch, sounds, and movement in order to feel secure and have their physical needs met at an optimal level14.  All primate infants, including humans, biologically expect to be in close contact and proximity with their caregivers.For hundreds of thousands of years mothers have effectively combined co-sleeping and breastfeeding to provide for their babies’ immediate social, psychological, and physical needs.According to James McKenna, mothers and babies who sleep with or close to each other develop coordinated sleep patterns, so it is often much easier to wake when the baby needs feeding or comforting and to fall back to sleep afterwards.When deprived of the physical comfort she needs, a baby will use her primary survival response — crying to attempt to attract the attention of her parents. By using cry-it-out methods to train their babies to sleep, parents are severing the link between crying and response. They are ignoring the very thing which is meant to ensure an infant’s survival.What about parents?Looking after a new baby can feel exhausting. Weinraub’s 2012 study claimed that mothers of babies who woke persistently were more likely to be depressed, although it recognised this needed further research.In fact, recent research by Kathleen Kendall-Tackett indicates that mothers who were exclusively breastfeeding reported significantly more hours of sleep, better physical health, more energy, and lower rates of depression than mothers who were mixed- or formula-feeding.15One of the things many parents find useful is to know that what they are experiencing is normal. Just knowing that they are not alone and that night waking is something many others experience can make all the difference. When parents are led to expect that babies should sleep through the night at a certain age, that they should learn to sleep on their own and ‘self-soothe’, parenting doubts and concerns can arise. It can be helpful to talk to other parents who understand their difficulties, including those who have seen their children develop and start sleeping through the night when they are ready. The age at which this happens will vary greatly from child to child and labelling a child who wakes up as having a “sleep problem” can be misleading.If a mother is feeling exhausted, it may help to look at the family’s life as a whole and ask if anything can be done to make it easier. Are there times in the day when the mother might be able to make time to sleep? Perhaps a trusted friend or family member could be asked to come to the house and keep an eye on the baby for an hour or so in the day while the mother has a rest, or give a hand with household tasks. Taking a short break to do something she enjoys, or even having a relaxing bath, can revitalise her and make it easier to give time to the baby. Knowing that night waking is normal and will pass helps to create a more positive feeling. Believing that it is wrong and you should be doing something about it builds negativity.Many parents already instinctively stay with their baby while he falls asleep and avoid stressful crying. Some mothers also decide to keep their baby right beside them during the night and find this much easier than attempting an unrealistic bedtime routine.Making a decision which feels rightAll parents need to make choices which feel right to them, basing their decisions on accurate information. While “experts” may assure parents that they shouldn’t feel guilty about not comforting their babies when they are crying, many parents find their instinct to go to their child is hard to ignore. In her study, Weinraub says that parents should “resist the urge to respond right away to awakenings”.16Ideally, this kind of decision would be based on what the parents feel is best for them and their own baby, rather than academic advice.La Leche League GBLLL accredited Leaders are mothers who have breastfed their own babies and know that when a mother needs a bit of help it can’t wait until tomorrow.

"Breastfeeding mothers who need to sit an exam can feel concerned about how to manage separation from their babies while they might need a feed, as well as how to avoid the health risks of not removing enough milk from their breasts.One of the first routes may be to talk to the examiner and explain the situation. It may be possible to make special arrangements to accommodate breastfeeding.Shorter length examsMothers who have to take exams of around three to four hours have found various ways of coping.When Anna found her exam was scheduled for three weeks after her baby’s birth, she asked for an invigilator to come to her home. She arranged for another carer to be there for the baby, nursed just before the exam started, and then took the three-hour exam without a break, finishing just as the baby was ready for a feed. It was the longest the baby had ever gone between feeds!Claire needed to take an exam when her baby was five weeks old. She built up a supply of expressed milk beforehand, just in case the baby got upset, and during the exam her mother put the baby in a sling and went for a long walk. Claire had arranged beforehand that if her baby got upset her mother would text the invigilator, who would quietly take Claire out of the room. She would be allowed to nurse the baby, in the company of another staff member and without speaking to anyone, before returning the baby to her mother. Claire got through the exam without being called, but says the first feed afterwards was wonderful!One mother of twins arranged beforehand for a set break to go and nurse her babies.International Board of Lactation Consultant ExaminersIBLCE exam candidates normally sit a continuous four-hour computer based exam. Breastfeeding mothers of babies under 12 months can arrange a scheduled break.  For a baby older than 12 months there is an extra charge to cover the cost of an extra proctor to be with them while away from the exam centre.  Some mothers of younger babies have found they could arrange to have their baby in a nearby room with a carer.Further information can be foundhere.What about longer exams?Some mothers find they are unable to avoid taking a long exam while still breastfeeding and it has sometimes proved difficult to arrange adequate breaks for expressing. While provision can be made for examinees with specific needs to have extra breaks, the needs of breastfeeding mothers have not been specifically addressed in this context in the past. However, in 2007, a US mother fought a decision not to allow breaks for expressing milk when she had to take a long medical exam and the court found in her favour. It ruled that the issue was one of gender discrimination and nursing mothers should be given extra break time to express milk during long exams.Possible legal routes within GBIf a woman is told she cannot express her milk during exams, the first route might be to explain the potential health consequences, such as engorgement and mastitis. The following acts might help.Equality Act 2010According to the Equality Act of 2010, treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding a child of any age is considered sex discrimination. Having to sit an exam in increasing discomfort and with the possibility of health consequences might be considered unfavourable treatment. A mother might be able to bring up the issue of sex discrimination as a relevant factor in the decision to allow her to take pumping breaks. If she is denied such breaks, she can contact the Government Equalities Office. A solicitor can advise on whether a claim can be brought for discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act.Human Rights ActIt may also be possible to object under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which regulates the right to respect for private and family life. Amongst other things, this applies to a woman’s right to physical integrity and autonomy, i.e. what she does and doesn’t do with her own body. A mother might also argue under Article 3 that it is inhuman and degrading to be prevented from removing milk from her body, particularly if she is refused the right to pump. A mother would need to make it clear that she is being put at serious health risk by not being allowed to express breastmilk.After the examAs Claire found, after the exam breastfeeding provides a way for mother and baby to reconnect. The baby may be a little more fussy and may want to nurse more, but any drop in milk production should soon be resolved.  Prior communication about the situation, an understanding of why a break may be needed, and good planning can all help to ensure taking the exam goes as smoothly as possible.Written by Anna Burbidge and Johanna Rhys-DaviesCopyright LLLGB 2016",https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-taking-exams/,Breastfeeding and Taking Exams

"If you’re expecting a baby and are continuing to breastfeed your older child, many questions may be going through your mind. Mothers  can breastfeed while pregnant; some go on to nurse both their new baby and their older child after the birth. This is known as ‘tandem nursing’.Breastfeeding during pregnancy is a special, unique relationship and one that may constantly evolve to take into account your changing needs and those of your older child. Breastfeeding can help you meet your child’s needs more easily, especially if he is tired or unwell, and it continues to give him important nutritional and immunological benefits. However, breastfeeding whilst pregnant can often invoke intense feelings. Extra support at this time can be crucial and you may find talking things over at your local LLL meetings really helpful.Is it safe?NutritionMorning sicknessMilk supply and colostrumManaging when you are not enjoying itCoping with questions and commentsDeciding to weanTandem feedingFurther ReadingIs it safe?Research tells us there’s usually no reason why a mother shouldn’t breastfeed while pregnant. Although breastfeeding may help a slow labour to progress, the amount of oxytocin normally released is not usually enough to cause the cervix to open before it is ready to do so.  Oxytocin is also released during sex, which is generally considered to be safe during pregnancy.  If you are expecting multiples or considered to be at risk for miscarriage/early delivery you may be advised to stop breastfeeding. You could discuss this with a breastfeeding-friendly caregiver.NutritionYou won’t be depriving your unborn baby of nutrients by continuing to breastfeed so long as you eat reasonably well. Getting plenty of rest and eating nutrient dense food will help you stay well-nourished and healthy.The UK Department of Health recommends that all pregnant women take a vitamin D and folic acid supplement (often taken in the form of the Healthy Start vitamins).Calcium needs during pregnancy and the first six months of breastfeeding it is normal to experience a gradual loss of bone density. Even if breastfeeding continues, recovery of bone mineral content (BMC) starts from around 3–6 months and is generally complete by about 12 months after birth. If a mother has breastfed there may even be a small overall increase. When a mother becomes pregnant again before 12 months BMC actually continues to increase and tandem nursing mothers have no increased risk for osteoporosis. During pregnancy your body absorbs more calcium from the food you eat. If you feel your diet is low in calcium, then eating foods rich in calcium (eg leafy greens, nuts and seeds) may be a good idea but otherwise there’s no need for any extra.Morning sicknessPregnant mothers often have nausea, whether breastfeeding or not, though breastfeeding while pregnant may make it worse. Eating frequent healthy snacks can help manage nausea, as can getting more rest. Some mothers find motion sickness wristbands work for them.Milk supply and colostrumAround the fourth or fifth month (sometimes before) your milk production is likely to reduce due to pregnancy hormones. The composition of your milk will also change and become more similar to weaning milk. Your child may nurse less or wean completely. Some children resume nursing at a later stage. The drop in milk production is due to hormonal changes and nursing more frequently or pumping won’t increase production in the same way it does when you are not pregnant. Your baby may need age appropriate supplements and a baby under 12 months may need his weight monitored. Continuing to breastfeed during pregnancy has no effect on the milk supply that you will have following the birth of your new baby. Colostrum is produced during pregnancy whether or not it is being removed.Managing when you are not enjoying itYou may experience nipple soreness, increased nausea and/or feelings of irritability caused by pregnancy hormones. Limiting nursing times, (eg to a few minutes or even a few sucks), ensuring a deep latch, distraction, and offering other snacks/liquids can all help to make nursing through pregnancy more manageable. Support from family and friends can help you get more rest.Coping with questions and commentsPregnancy and breastfeeding can be an emotionally challenging time. It can be difficult if you hear negative comments from others. Talking about the importance of breastfeeding to you and your child can sometimes help people appreciate that this is something you have carefully considered and that it is your choice for your family. Sharing information/research and surrounding yourself with supportive people can also help.  Yourlocal LLL groupwill be a good source of support.Deciding to weanThe decision to stop breastfeeding is a very personal one and one only you or your child will make. It is useful not to have too many expectations when you get pregnant.Tandem feedingContinuing to nurse your older child after your new born arrives can help maintain and strengthen your special bond. Mothers often say that tandem feeding helps their older child to be more accepting of their newborn sibling and helps them through the emotional transition of having to now share their mum. Tandem feeding can also foster a special bond between the siblings.

"Breastmilk is instantly available for babies and is wonderfully convenient wherever a mother is. This is particularly important as babies have small stomachs and breastmilk is digested very quickly.  However, many mothers worry about breastfeeding in public spaces and are unsure about their rights in the event of negative comments from other people.What does the law say?It is entirely legal to breastfeed in public places anywhere in the UK.According to the Equality Act of 2010, treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding a child of any age is considered sex discrimination. This applies to any business or premise providing services to the public, including public institutions, associations and higher education bodies.Service providers dealing directly with the public must not discriminate, harass or victimise a woman because she is breastfeeding. Discrimination includes refusing to provide a service, providing a lower standard of service or providing a service on different terms.Can cafes, restaurants and shops ask a breastfeeding woman to leave?Businesses, such as a cafes, restaurants and shops, are not allowed to ask a woman to stop breastfeeding her child or refuse to serve her. This is applicable to mothers breastfeeding children of any age, as the law protects them for as long as they wish to breastfeed their babies.If anyone being served in a cafe takes offence at a breastfeeding mother, the business owner could offer to move them to a different table, but it is against the law to ask the mother in question to leave because she’s breastfeeding.A guide produced by the Government Equalities Office to explain the 2010 Equality Act to businesses selling goods and services states: “A business may ask a breastfeeding woman to leave their premises if the reason for this request is not due to her breastfeeding. However, if the woman later claims that discrimination occurred because she was breastfeeding, the business will have to prove that there was in fact no discrimination.”It is possible that individual business employees, owners or managers may not be aware of these regulations and may tell a woman that she cannot breastfeed on the business premises. If this happens, the mother can challenge their request.If still asked to stop breastfeeding or leave the premises, a woman can contact the Government Equalities Office. A solicitor can advise on whether a claim can be brought for discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act.What about communal public spaces?If a mother is out with her baby she may need to stop and breastfeed. She is not required to cover herself or go to a specific feeding room, but people may occasionally object.In England and WalesA woman cannot be prosecuted for breastfeeding under public decency laws. A mother can ignore people who ask her to stop feeding and she can just carry on. Unfortunately though, she has no specific legal protection against their actual comments objecting to breastfeeding. If, however, the remarks become aggressive or abusive then women have a right to report this as with any other form of abuse.In ScotlandUnder Scottish legislation, it is an offence to deliberately prevent or stop a woman from breastfeeding in a public place. If a mother is approached by anyone, anywhere, and asked to stop breastfeeding, she has the right to phone the police who will attend, discuss with the person involved, and warn them that they are committing an offence liable to a fine of up to £2,500.In Northern IrelandBreastfeeding mothers are protected by sex discrimination laws that prohibit anyone from treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding and the Government intends to introduce specific legislation to support and protect breastfeeding infants and their mothers in public places.Breastfeeding is normalAlthough in recent years breastfeeding may have been considered something which should not be done in public, limiting nursing when out and about can restrict your baby’s food intake. Breastfeeding is the most natural way of understanding and satisfying your baby’s needs and its importance in terms of promoting healthy development for both baby and mother is officially recognised by healthcare organisations all over the world. The more often breastfeeding is noticed, the more easily it will be accepted by the public, leading to a change in people’s attitudes and a reduction in any criticism.Written by Anna Burbidge and Eva WilliamsCopyright LLLGB 2016Further readingOut & about with your breastfed babySupporting women’s right to breastfeed2010 Equality ActInformation for New Mothers, Pregnant Women and Families – Information about Feeding a Child in Public and Private Spaces: The Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005",https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-public-spaces/,Breastfeeding in Public Spaces
"Ask any breastfeeding mother why she’s chosen to breastfeed. She’ll probably tell you about the benefits to herself, her baby and her family, as well as the joy and satisfaction of meeting her baby’s needs for food, protection and security through breastfeeding. Mothers who stop breastfeeding after a difficult start may miss this experience. And when a much-longed-for baby is adopted or born by surrogacy, the reasons for breastfeeding can be just as powerful and compelling.Breastfeeding is more than the provision of milk, with its protective and nourishing qualities. An adoptive mother may choose to nurture her baby at the breast, regarding any breastmilk as an added benefit. And mothers who relactate often do so to re-establish the breastfeeding relationship.Will I make enough milk?Relactation—a second chance at breastfeedingBreastfeeding an adopted babyMilk ProductionGetting StartedSupplementationIncreasing Milk Supply By BreastfeedingWhen a baby is reluctant to breastfeedMoving away from supplementsExpressing breastmilkGalactogoguesDefine your own successMaintaining Milk ProductionWill I make enough milk?This will depend on your individual situation. Many mothers find they can produce enough milk to be able to give up supplements totally. While there is no guarantee that you will be able to meet all of your baby’s needs, you can maximise the amount of breastmilk they receive. Any amount of breastmilk is beneficial. Even if you haven’t managed to cut out supplements totally by the time your baby is over six months old, solid foods can gradually start to replace any formula supplements.Relactation—a second chance at breastfeedingIt can be easy to stop breastfeeding, even if things are going fairly well. Many mothers struggle to establish breastfeeding because of difficult circumstances such as lack of access to accurate information and/or lack of support. They end up stopping breastfeeding, but then might regret their decision.Vicky’s storyAn induced birth and separation led to feeding difficulties and Toby losing too much weight. He had to be treated for jaundice and was later hospitalised with an infection. Vicky started to bottlefeed her baby with infant formula to ensure he started gaining weight. After all she had been through, she felt sad and guilty but also slightly relieved.“Back home we settled into a routine of bottlefeeding, but day by day I became more and more upset by my decision. My baby would turn to me to try to breastfeed and I couldn’t believe that I couldn’t do it. After a week of not breastfeeding I deeply regretted my decision and contacted La Leche League, where I was offered the support and encouragement I needed. At the time I had no idea it was possible to restart breastfeeding once you had given up. I started by putting my baby to the breast as often as possible and before every formula feed.It was only a couple of days before I felt the milk coming in and my breasts started to feel full before feeds. I found I didn’t really have time to express as I was breastfeeding a lot of the time. Some afternoons I spent hours breastfeeding but I didn’t let this worry me and just sat down with a good book or a movie. I continued to supplement with formula, writing down the amount I was giving at each feed and gradually started to reduce it. In fact, as I was reducing the last bit Toby suddenly jumped up in weight so I realised he actually didn’t need the top-ups and I just needed confidence that I had enough milk to feed him.I am so pleased that I made the decision to give it another go. It has been hard work but never a chore. Every day I continue to feed Toby I feel amazed at what I’ve achieved. He’s now four months old and is a big, healthy baby.”From LLLGB’sBreastfeeding Mattersissue number 178.Breastfeeding an adopted babyIt is possible to establish milk production for an adopted baby, even if you have never been pregnant or given birth.Ginny’s story“Carly came to us at 12 weeks. Her foster mother from day two had been lovely to her. She had Carly on infant formula feeds. The first time I put Carly to my breast she happily latched on, even though there was no milk and no supplementer.* Wow! I’d forgotten the strength of a baby’s suck. It didn’t make me sore and soon I was used to it and loved having another baby to nurse.Her big brother (who was home-made) had fully weaned three years before.  My attempts to assemble the supplementer were hopeless for the first day or two. Not that it’s difficult, but I was anxious, so her dad got it ready for me to just hang round my neck. Carly easily did the switch from bottle to breast with supplementer. Pretty soon I noticed her dirty nappies showing breastmilk stools (yellow, runny, sweeter smell) along with the artificial infant milk ones. I soon had a thirst at feeding times and needed a glass of water next to me.Then a couple of weeks or so on I had a go at expressing and saw some drops of real live breastmilk! I knew a lot of theory but still doubted my body’s ability to lactate without childbirth. Nearly three months on, Carly didn’t need any more infant formula than she had at 12 weeks old, so my breasts were making the rest of her requirements. Her skin glowed in that breastmilk way. I really felt like I was her mum.The breastfeeding, along with using a baby carrier lots of the day and keeping her nearby at night, helped me bond. Certainly it wasn’t just as easy and convenient as fully breastfeeding, but it was worth the effort. I shall always be thankful for such a good start to mothering our adopted child.”* Nursing supplementer—a device worn by a mother through which her baby receives other milk whilst nursing at the breast. For more information, seeSupplementation(below) and our page onNursing Supplementers.Milk ProductionDuring pregnancy, hormones cause the milk-making cells and milk ducts in the breast to enlarge and multiply.Colostrum (low volume milk, high in protein and antibodies) is produced from late in pregnancy. After birth, milk is produced and released in response to the baby’s suckling and the hormones prolactin and oxytocin. For a mother who has previously breastfed, stimulating the breasts to produce milk without pregnancy and childbirth is called relactation. If you have never had a baby before, this process is called induced lactation.Milk production depends upon a number of factors, including:• Your baby’s age and willingness to breastfeed effectively.• Frequency of breastfeeding and/or milk expression.• Whether you have ever been pregnant, and how long ago.• Effective treatment of any medical conditions you have, eg thyroid problems or diabetes.• Extent of any previous damage to your chest/breasts/nipples eg surgery, burn or other injury.• Extent of any previous damage to the pituitary gland in your brain (where the necessary hormones are produced).• Reason for any infertility.• Practical and emotional support available to youGetting StartedIt’s possible to induce lactation successfully and increase milk production just by breastfeeding frequently and/or expressing.It can take anything from a few days to a few weeks to be able to express a few drops of milk. You can express as you prepare for the arrival of your baby and/or while you encourage them to the breast. Certain hormonal, herbal, pharmacological and dietary treatments can also help stimulate milk production (seeGalactagoguesbelow).If you are adopting, you can also stimulate breast development and induce lactation using oral contraceptives.www.asklenore.infodescribes various protocols, depending upon how long it will be before you are likely to welcome your new baby into your family. However these methods are not suitable for mothers who can’t take oral contraceptives or are taking medications to suppress oestrogen levels.Medical conditions and breastfeedingIf you have a medical condition and/or are taking any medication, tell your doctor that you are planning to breastfeed. Lactation can affect the management of certain medical conditions. Mothers often find medical conditions improve or are easier to manage while they are lactating. If a medication you are taking is incompatible with breastfeeding or may affect milk production there are usually alternatives. An LLL Leader can research information about any medications you take and about breastfeeding with specific medical conditions.Learning to breastfeedYour baby will probably have already experienced bottlefeeding, and breastfeeding may be a totally new experience for them. They may take to it quickly or need time and patience to get used to this new way of feeding. Mothers have found that even babies older than three or four months can still learn to breastfeed. Breastfeeding may be a new experience for you too so finding good support and information on the basics of breastfeeding, including comfortable positioning and attachment will be invaluable. Check out the Further Reading section below. If you are relactating it may also help to talk to an LLL Leader about why you stopped breastfeeding. If possible attend your local LLL group. You can be sure of support and information, even if you attend while bottlefeeding.Close contact really helpsOffer lots of close contact and carrying, either skin-to-skin or lightly dressed, to help your baby associate close contact with pleasure and comfort. Offering to breastfeed before they are too hungry or when they are sleepy may help them respond instinctively to the sensations of being held at the breast. Breastfeeding, rather than using a dummy, when your baby needs to comfort suck can encourage them to nurse more too.SupplementationAt first you will probably need to supplement some breastfeeds with your expressed breastmilk or infant formula. Alternatives to using a bottle can help your baby with the transition to breastfeeding, depending on his age and previous feeding experiences.Nursing Supplementershas details of how to use supplemental nursing systems. Nursing supplementers are devices worn by a mother through which her baby receives other milk whilst nursing at the breast. For older babies, cups are also an option. There is more information on managing and reducing supplements inMy Baby Needs More Milk.If bottles are usedIf you choose to use a bottle to give supplements, the following tips can help your baby switch to breastfeeding.• A smaller teat hole prevents a baby being overwhelmed with milk; a larger one means he has to suck less strongly.• Hold him in an upright position, using your hand to support his neck and head.• To encourage your baby to open wide, place the teat across his upper and lower lips with the tip at the ridge between the upper lip and nose.• Allow your baby some control. Let him take the bottle teat into his mouth himself. Avoid pushing the teat into his mouth.• Tip the bottle just enough to give a gentle flow so your baby isn’t overwhelmed with milk. As the bottle empties, you’ll need to gradually tip the bottle more and lean your baby back.• Encourage frequent pauses to mimic breastfeeding.• Allow your baby to decide when he has had enough.Different supplementsIf you have expressed breastmilk, give this first, before you give your baby any infant formula supplement. To make the most of your precious milk avoid mixing the two together. Infant formula supplements need to be prepared just before use and according to current safety guidelines (see below). Allow prepared powdered formula to cool to body temperature or below so as to avoid burns. Although expensive, using ready-to-feed formula may be more convenient when you are out and about or at home without help. Concentrated and ready to feed forms of infant formula are less likely to clog nursing supplementer tubing than powdered forms.Monitoring weight gainMonitor your baby’s weight gain and keep a check on his wet and dirty nappies to reassure yourself he is gettingenough milk.Using infant formulaYou will probably need to use infant formula whilst you work to increase your milk production. Powdered infant formula is not a sterile product. To reduce health risks associated with using infant formula, follow carefully theNHS guidelines for preparing formula.Increasing Milk Supply By BreastfeedingBreastfeed oftenIt may take a little patience to get your baby to nurse effectively. If your baby is willing, offer the breast every one to two hours and at least 10–12 times in every 24 hours. Cut out any dummy use and let him breastfeed for comfort as well as food to help stimulate milk production. Be prepared to encourage night-time and frequent evening nursing, as this can be particularly good at increasing milk production. Laid back breastfeeding positions also boost the levels of the hormones that increase your milk. A soft carrier or sling can be a handy way of keeping your baby close and encouraging breastfeeding.Start and finish at the breastBabies expect fast flowing milk at the start of a feed when they are thirsty. So: 1. Breastfeed first from both breasts, using breast compression (see box below) to encourage flow, until your baby begins to fuss. 2. Offer a supplement until he is not quite satisfied. 3. Then finish the feed at the breast, using breast compression again. This can work well even if you need to give larger amounts of supplement. If your milk production is very low you can start feeds at step 2 until it increases a little.Try breast compressionThis technique can encourage a baby to breastfeed actively and take more milk.1. Support your breast with one hand—thumb on one side, fingers on the other.2. Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, his jaw moving all the way to his ear. When he stops swallowing, compress your breast firmly to increase milk flow and prompt swallowing. Hold it squeezed while he continues nursing actively then release your hand.3. Rotate your hand around the breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast.Go gently—this should not hurt. Experiment to find what works best for you. Try switching breasts at least two or three times during each feed—when he comes off the first breast on his own, or when breast compression no longer keeps him breastfeeding actively. With time, your baby will need less and less breast compression to keep him actively nursing, until you will find that you no longer need to do this.A deep, comfortable latchAttention to positioning and attachment will help ensure your baby is feeding effectively. You can try experimentingwith different feeding positions. Many mothers find laid back or Biological Nurturing™ a good way of encouraging a baby to nurse really well. Many babies instinctively seek the breast and attach deeply and comfortably if they can snuggle up close to their mother’s chest for periods of time.Try letting your baby lie on your body, skin-toskin or lightly dressed, as you recline so both his chest and tummy are against you.As your body supports your baby, this leaves your hands free to help with latch on. SeePositioning & Attachmentfor more information.Some babies who are accustomed to taking adummyor supplements from a bottle may not take a big enough mouthful of breast and might need to be coached to get a wide enough mouth. Try opening your own mouth very wide and encouraging your baby to look at and imitate you. If you can’t get comfortablespeak to an LLL Leaderwho can give you further suggestions.Take a ‘baby moon’Get some help with household jobs, ignore the dust and eat simple, easily prepared meals for a week or two so you can concentrate on breastfeeding your baby. A couple of days’ bed rest together with your baby can really boost your milk production. Even if you can’t manage this, do plan some time each day to sit or lie down with your baby.Positive signsSigns that your milk is increasing include:• Hormonal changes, such as a brief slump in mood before your milk appears.• Breasts feeling hotter, tingling, fuller or heavier.• Feeling thirsty when breastfeeding.• Leaking milk and/or being able to express more milk.• Your baby gains weight and produces more wet and dirty nappies, especially yellow, mustard-coloured poos.• Your baby starts to refuse supplements.When a baby is reluctant to breastfeedSome babies don’t take to breastfeeding straight away. It can be enormously frustrating if he refuses but patience and gentle persistence can work wonders.Ideas to try• Offer close contact skin-to-skin or lightly dressed for sustained periods of time each day even if your baby is reluctant to latch on at all.• Letting your baby doze on your chest in Biological Nurturing™ or laid-back positions may prompt him to seek out the breast instinctively. Bathing and sleeping together can also have the same effect.• Express a little milk to stimulate your let-down so your milk flows as soon as he latches on.• Or offer a little supplement to take the edge off his hunger and help calm him before you attempt to breastfeed.• If he will latch on, use breast compression to help maintain your milk flow. You can switch sides to maintain his interest too.For more ideas seeMy Baby Won’t BreastfeedandNipple Confusion?Keeping calmEncouraging a reluctant baby to nurse can become stressful. Try to keep calm and avoid conveying anxiety to your baby. Some mothers find relaxation exercises helpful. It’s quite possible that, once your baby is comfortable and relaxed with the closeness, he may latch on when you least expect it, especially if you are expressing to increase your milk production. And even if he doesn’t, you will still have pleasant memories of times spent in close contact together. Remember that you are spending time expressing as well as feeding and caring for your baby. You are doing far more than a mother who is simply bottlefeeding or breastfeeding alone. Be gentle on yourself and take time to meet your own needs for food and rest.Moving away from supplementsWhile your baby is slow to gain weight or not breastfeeding well, keep offering the same amount of supplement. If you get to a point when you are expressing enough milk each day to meet your baby’s needs then you can encourage your baby to get all his milk at your breast instead and gradually cut out the expressed milk supplements. Offer frequent feeds making sure he is latched on well, and use breast compression to help maintain milk flow if his suckling slows or stops. Switching sides several times during a feed can help maintain his interest in nursing and maximise the amount of milk he takes.Reduce supplements graduallyOnce he is nursing and gaining weight steadily, and you are producing more milk, you can start reducing supplements gradually.• Reduce the amount of supplement every few days so your baby continues to get plenty of milk.• It’s best to reduce all or several of the day’s supplements by very small amounts, about 5–15ml for each one.• At times of the day when you feel as though you have more milk, for example, in the morning, you may be able to reduce a supplement by 20–30ml.• Keep an eye on your baby’s wet and dirty nappies so you know that he’s taking plenty of milk.• Keep in touch with your health visitor or GP for regular weighing, and to discuss reducing supplements. Be prepared to take things more slowly if your baby becomes fussy or seems hungry. You may need to slow or temporarily stop reducing supplements.Expressing breastmilkBefore your baby is breastfeedingThe more frequently you express, the more milk you are likely to make. Express at least 8 times each 24 hours,including once during the night if possible. Try to establish a routine you can sustain on a day-to-day basis, and fit in extra sessions on days when you have more time. Milk you express before your adopted baby arrives can be frozen for later use. Even a little breastmilk, however small, is beneficial for a baby. An actively nursing baby is more effective at stimulating milk production than any pump, so you can continue to work to induce and increase your milk supply once your baby arrives and/or is breastfeeding.In addition to breastfeedingYou can express between feeds to stimulate milk production if your baby is reluctant to take the breast or is sleepy and not feeding effectively. You can also express after breastfeeds (either immediately or after a short break) to help stimulate milk production. Expressing even small amounts after feeding boosts milk production. You can give any milk you express as a supplement before you give formula.If your baby will go to the breast frequently, breastfeeding really is the best way of increasing your milk.Expressing milk is an extra, to give your milk production a boost. Mothers who breastfeed frequently (10–12 times a day or more) and don’t have the time to express any milk often increase their milk and establish breastfeeding fastest. Don’t be surprised if you don’t notice any increase in the amount of milk you can express. If you are nursing your baby frequently, he will take the extra milk directly at the breast without you realising.Hand expressionHand expression is very effective, especially for mothers producing small amounts of milk. The skin contact helps stimulate milk flow. Hand expression also works well when combined with pumping. Use it to stimulate your milk flow before pumping, to maintain flow whilst you are actually pumping and/or after pumping to express milk the pump has not reached.PumpingHospital-grade pumps are considered the most effective for mothers needing to induce or increase their milk supply. Pumping both breasts at the same time saves time, stimulates milk production and boosts milk-producing hormones better than single pumping. When pumping one breast at a time, try switching back and forth between breasts as your milk flow slows. Sterilise equipment once a day if your baby is healthy. Just like your milk, pumping equipment can safely be left at room temperature for short periods and refrigerated in a clean container for longer periods, giving you more time for your baby. SeeStoring Your Milkfor details.Making time to expressIt can help to think of expressing time as an enjoyable break to have with a drink, snack or treat. Put your feet up and listen to, watch or read something you enjoy. Find something that makes you relax and smile. The less you think about the process, the more you may be able to express.Try expressing your milk:• In the evening if your baby sleeps—to ‘put in an order’ for more milk tomorrow.• During or after skin-to-skin contact.• Little and often—as frequently as you can manage.More information aboutexpressing your milk.GalactogoguesMedicinal herbs such as fenugreek or prescription medications such as domperidone can increase milk production in conjunction with breast stimulation.Galactogogues are effective only when combined with frequent nursing or expressingto ensure breasts are kept well drained.Many mothers can increase their milk by nursing and expressing alone and don’t need galactogogues. Galactogogues can have side effects. They also need to be taken regularly and in sufficient doses. Even then, not all mothers respond to them. Milk production can drop if you suddenly stop taking a galactogogue so it’s best to cut back gradually and only once you feel confident you are producing more milk than your baby currently needs.FenugreekTake three 500mg capsules, three times a day (nine per day in total). It takes 24–72 hours to see an increase in milk production. Possible side effects include perspiring more profusely and sweat and urine smelling like maple syrup. A few mothers have developed diarrhoea and a few mothers with asthma have reported aggravation of their symptoms. Two cases of fenugreek allergy have been reported (fenugreek is closely related to peanuts). Be cautious if you have diabetes, since fenugreek lowers blood sugar. If you develop any worrying symptoms, stop taking fenugreek and consult your doctor if necessary.DomperidoneYou will need a prescription from your GP. The dose usually recommended is one or two 10mg tablets three times a day. Domperidone is not licensed for use as a galactogogue.FromUK Medicines Information(document will download for viewing):‘As there are limited alternative options for the stimulation of lactation, the use of domperidone can be considered provided there is evidence of thorough evaluation for treatable causes such as poor attachment, and when increased frequency of breastfeeding, pumping or hand expression of milk has not been successful. A maternal dose of 30mg daily for a maximum of 1 week should not be exceeded.Domperidone should not be used if the mother or infant:have conditions where the cardiac conduction is, or could be, impairedhave underlying cardiac diseases such as congestive heart failureare receiving other medications known to prolong QT or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g. ketoconazole or erythromycin. If this is the case, metoclopramide is the preferred alternative.have severe hepatic impairment’Define your own successRelactation or adoptive breastfeeding can be a big commitment. Some mothers consider it but decide it is not for them. Whether or not you choose to go ahead with it, just knowing that it is a possibility can help you come to terms with what you have experienced and to feel in control.Relactation or adoptive breastfeeding is probably best entered into with equal measures of optimism and realism. You might find it helpful to define your own level of success in what you aim to achieve. You may be able to bring in a full milk supply, but even small amounts of breastmilk are beneficial. If your main purpose is to enjoy the closeness of breastfeeding, you can aim to nurse for comfort whenever possible and use a nursing supplementer for feeds. Any breastmilk you produce is a bonus for your baby.Maintaining Milk ProductionEvery drop of breastmilk counts To maintain milk production as long as possible while supplementing with formula:• Breastfeed often and as long at each feed as your baby is willing to, including nursing for comfort between feeds.• Avoid going longer than eight hours without breastfeeding or expressing.• Use breast compression to maximise the milk your baby receives each time he goes to the breast, and to help keep your breasts well drained.• Give formula only after he has nursed. • Offer the breast again if he is willing after taking a formula supplement.• Whilst your baby’s weight gain is steady, avoid increasing the amount of formula he receives.MenstruationSome mothers find their milk production drops temporarily just before or when they are menstruating. If you continue to breastfeed and/or pump, milk production will increase in a few days.Out at work?You could:• Compensate for lack of daytime nursing by encouraging some night-time nursing.• Make extra efforts to increase your milk on days when you are off work. As your milk production increases, or after days at home, your breasts may feel fuller. Be prepared to express milk while at work to keep comfortable, to prevent engorgement and to reduce the risk of mastitis.There may come a point when you decide to stop because establishing breastfeeding isn’t working out. Pumping to keep up milk production takes a lot of time and is not a long-term option for many mothers when a baby doesn’t take to the breast easily. But whatever happens, be proud because every single drop of breastmilk you have given your baby will have been beneficial. You know that you did everything possible to make breastfeeding an option. If you have another baby, don’t hesitate to get in touch with La Leche League again. Making contact with LLL before your baby arrives means you can share your concerns and gather information to help avoid problems. Knowing who to contact means you’ll be able to get help quickly to prevent any minor problems in those early weeks from escalating.Support networkLLL groupsare a great source of support for all mothers who are working to establish breastfeeding, whatever their circumstances. If you plan to adopt or have a baby born by surrogacy, you can attend LLL meetings before your baby arrives just like other expectant mothers.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone, and mothers of LLLGBFurther ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

"Getting your baby positioned and attached comfortably at the breast is an art—mothers often say it takes a little while for breastfeeding to feel entirely comfortable and natural, even if they’ve breastfed before. In the past girls grew up learning about breastfeeding by watching mothers in their families and communities. These days many of us become mothers having never seen a baby breastfeed.But breastfeeding has worked for mothers and babies for thousands of years and it can work for you too.Many babies can find their way to the breast by themselves, especially if they haven’t been too affected by birth interventions. Other mums and babies need a little longer to work it out with maybe some help from a skilled breastfeeding supporter such as anLLL Leader.When all is going well, specific holds and positions don’t really matter because you and your baby will work out what suits you best. However if you are finding it awkward, uncomfortable or downright painful then the following information is designed to help you think about where you can make adjustments and get breastfeeding working comfortably for you.Good positioning and attachment is important for maintaining milk production.A baby who attaches deeply at the breast is able to remove milk effectively.This is important for maintaining milk production. Well-drained breasts make milk quickly. If there is any concern about how much milk you are making, working on improving positioning and attachment is an important first step.There’s no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’.If you are comfortable, your baby is producing plenty of dirty nappies and is gaining weight after the first few days, then breastfeeding is going well for you. There are no rules—but there are a few principles that can help you work out what to do if things aren’t going well: seeLatching on – getting a good attachment.Positioningdescribes how you sit or lie and how you support your baby as he takes the breast. How you hold your baby can make a big difference to how well he can breastfeed. Even small adjustments can be significant.Attachmentdescribes the way he latches onto the breast.Tips for getting startedThe laid-back approachLatching on – getting a good attachmentDifferent breastfeeding positionsAs time goes byTips for getting startedIf it hurts then make changesIf it doesn’t feel right to you, then it isn’t fine, whatever anyone says. Pain is your body’s way of letting you know something is wrong. Start by trying to improve positioning and attachment. A few quick adjustments to how you are sitting or lying or how your baby comes towards the breast may be all that are needed.Sometimes it can take a little longer. You may need to work with one or more skilled breastfeeding supporters over a period of time to get to the point where everything falls into place and breastfeeding starts feeling natural.Each mother and baby pair is different and what works well for one mother and baby may not work for you. This is one reason why you may hear different suggestions from different helpers. You are the best judge of what is helpful so don’t be afraid to use what feels right for you and discard the rest.Your baby needs to be calmYou can offer the breast at any time when you are both calm. You may even find it easier if your baby isn’t obviously hungry. Feed your baby before he needs to cry. Early cues for wanting to eat include suckingtheir hand, smacking their lips, turning their head towards you, or fussing. They won’t latch well if they are distressed. If your baby is upset take time to soothe them. Hold them upright against you, stroke them and talk to them. A little expressed colostrum or breastmilk given on a spoon can help to calm them if they are desperately hungry.Your baby needs full body contactWhen your baby is held in full body contact against you, they will feel stable and be better able to coordinate their movements. Laid back positions ensure full body contact. If you’re sitting up, you’ll need to hug your baby in as tightly as if you were standing up holding them against you. Babies who don’t feel stable tend to wave their arms around, which can make latching more difficult. Pillows can get in the way and aren’t always necessary. So wait until after your baby’s latched on, and then tuck them in only if you need them for support.Some babies need timeSome babies find it difficult to latch on, or simply nurse ineffectively at the breast. Often a difficult birth or interventions during labour or birth are the cause. Giving a baby time to recover, and using laid-back breastfeeding positions  withskin-to-skin contactcan maximise your baby’s natural instinct to breastfeed. If your baby isn’t latching or feeding well seek help from an LLL Leader and read our pageMy Baby Won’t Breastfeed. With time and patience, most babies will breastfeed. In the meantimeexpress your milkfor your baby to maintain milk production and give you both the time to work it out.Laid-back breastfeedingLaid-back breastfeedingMany people assume you have to sit up to breastfeed. Not so. In fact evidence suggests humans evolved to breastfeed in laid-back positions with our babies upright against our chests. You may have experienced this type of position when you had your first feed, soon after your baby’s birth. There is more and more evidence that laid-back breastfeeding positions (also called Biological Nurturing) help babies breastfeed more effectively and are more comfortable for mothers, especially in the early days and weeks.Laid back breastfeeding is really useful for those first few days and weeks when you want to rest and recover and your baby needs to be in close contact with you to get breastfeeding established. It can be done skin-to-skin or with you both lightly dressed. You don’t have to be in bed; the sofa or a reclining chair is a comfortable alternative.You can also use laid-back breastfeeding principles when sitting in an upright chair by shifting your weight back onto your tail bone and reclining your body back a little, to open up a space for your baby. This allows more of their weight to be supported by your body and less by your arms. It isn’t safe to sleep with your baby on a chair or sofa.Sleepy babiesIf your baby issleepy, perhaps because of birth interventions, then using laid-back positions with skin-to-skin contact can encourage your baby’s interest in feeding. In laid-back positions babies often attach and feed when in light sleep so it helps to spend substantial periods of time with your sleepy baby against you. When you notice the little movements that indicate your baby is moving into a light period of sleep you can encourage them to latch.How laid back breastfeeding worksYou lay back in a comfortable, supported semi-reclining position (not flat) that opens up your body, creating space for your baby.Your baby lies against you, their whole front against your body, vertically or at any comfortable angle.Your baby feels stable and secure and their instinctive feeding reflexes are triggered, prompting them to bob their head and seek out the breast.Gravity helps them latch deeply and stay latched, rather than hindering the process.Your hands are free to support and caress your baby and help them attach.Your body releases the hormones that stimulate milk production and make you experience loving feelings towards your baby.There are no rules—you and your baby are free to work it out between yourselves.If you have twins or more, laid-back positions can allow you to feed two babies at once with less need for cushions or helping hands.Latching on — getting a good attachmentYour baby needs to tip their head back and reach forward with their lower jaw. As your baby tips their head back their jaw drops and their mouth opens wide, so they can anchor their chin and lower lip firmly against your breast. If they have to tuck their chin in to reach the nipple they won’t be able to open their mouth so wide. Tipping their head back also makes a deep latch possible, swallowing easier, and frees up their nose for comfortable breathing. In laid-back positions lay your baby with their head between your breasts. If you are sitting up, keep your supporting hand away from the back of their head. Babies tend to creep forward, so try shifting them so that their eyes and nose are opposite the nipple to encourage them to reach forward and anchor their chin first. In sitting or side lying positions a little push between the shoulder blades with your supporting hand or arm as they latch brings their chest in closer and helps their head tip back.Their lower jaw needs a clear space to anchor.Think about how you might take a mouthful from a big sandwich by placing your lower jaw first then opening your mouth to accommodate the top of the sandwich—the principle is the same. Your baby’s lower jaw needs to be deeply placed on your breast well away from the nipple. Keep the fingers of your supporting hand away from the place where their chin and lower jaw need to be so their lower lip and chin can sink into your breast. Your baby’s chin needs to stay firmly in contact with your breast.Your baby needs a big mouthful.When a baby chews on a nipple, this compresses the milk ducts, prevents milk flowing and hurts. When a baby has a good big mouthful of breast beyond the nipple, breastfeeding is comfortable and milk can flow. Some women like (or need) to hold their breast when nursing. They flatten their breast as they would a big sandwich they were offering to the baby, matching it to the oval of his mouth. This can help their baby grasp more breast tissue. It doesn’t matter if fingers are closer to the upper jaw but try to keep the “lower jaw fingers” out of your baby’s way. Biological Nurturing™ positions make use of gravity to help a baby get a bigger mouthful.The exaggerated latch. To get an even deeper latch you could try this optional extra. Place your thumb or finger near the base of the nipple where the middle of your baby’s upper lip will be, lined up with their nose. If you press, your nipple will tilt away from your baby, presenting them with your breast rather than your nipple. Avoid pressing your nipple into their mouth. As they open wide, snuggle them in close and use your thumb or finger to tuck the breast into their mouth. Your nipple will be taken in last and unroll in their mouth. You can then slip your finger out.Our own video below demonstratesflipple technique(aka exaggerated latch), it can be very helpful for getting an effective pain free latch:Let your breast rest at its natural level. It can be tempting to lift your breast and move it towards your baby’s mouth. If you do this, your baby probably won’t get a full mouthful, and after a while your hand will get tired and the breast will drop and slip out of their mouth. Breastfeeding pillows can get in the way too because they lift a baby up too high and prevent you tucking them in against your tummy. See where your breasts naturally rest and hold your baby accordingly. If you need them, tuck pillows in after they are well attached.Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby.Since breasts are attached to you and you baby is moveable it makes much more sense to bring your baby to the breast, not the other way round! And it works better too. With their body tucked firmly against you (or laid on top of your body), your baby will feel more stable and have better head control, and you’ll feel a lot more comfortable too.It’s easier to latch onto a softer breast.It’s much easier to get a deep mouthful if the breast is soft so breastfeed frequently to avoid engorgement. When your baby bobs their head and licks the nipple, it naturally makes it easier to latch on. If your breast is full and hard, you can usereverse pressure softeningto move fluids away from the nipple area so your baby can latch on well. Apply gentle steady pressure with your fingertips on the areola around your nipple for about a minute. You can also press with the sides of your thumbs or fingers. Denting the breast at the edge of the areola with a finger and placing your baby’s chin in the dent may also help. Gently hand express a little milk too if needed.Your baby needs to choose his own timing.Your baby will probably do best if they pick the moment to latch on. You can help by supporting them in a position that lets them do this when they are ready. To encourage your baby to gape hold them close against you, close enough to the breast so they know the nipple is there, but where they can’t quite reach it. Be prepared for your baby to lick and nuzzle for several minutes before they are ready to open wide.The natural or laid-back breastfeeding positions shown in the following videos can be a great help in encouraging your baby to latch on well, as well as being comfortable for you. You can recline comfortably with your baby on top of you with their whole front against you and their body completely supported by yours.Best Beginnings’ video demonstrates clearly how to make sure your baby is attaching well to the breast, you can view ithere.This video fromGlobal Health Mediademonstrates how to enable your baby to latch deeply on to your breast so that breastfeeding is comfortable for you and means your baby get enough milk:This video fromRaising Children.net.aushows how to attach your baby well, and shows a variety of comfortable breastfeeding positions:Using different breastfeeding positionsThe cradle holdAlthough the cradle hold is one of the most common nursing positions it can be a challenge for new mothers to learn. You need to hold your baby’s body firmly against you to give them stability because their weight is supported mainly by your arms. Shifting so you are sitting on your tailbone, rather than upright can help stability and reduce the strain on your arms (see picture right). It can be difficult to control a baby’s head and to keep them high enough and close enough to your breast. A small baby may tend to curl up in a ball in this position if not pulled in closely enough against your body. It may not be the best choice at first if you’re experiencing any problems with latch-on, milk transfer or if you have sore nipples. Once you’re more confident with breastfeeding, you may find you use a version of the cradle hold much of the time, especially when out and about.Tuck your baby’s body firmly against yours.Your baby’s whole front is against your tummy, their hip resting on or near your thigh, tucked around you like a comma. Their chest will be snuggled into the breast and your nipple near their nose.Their head is resting on your forearm and/ or wrist (not the crook of the elbow).As your baby opens their mouth to take the breast, pull their body in firmly against you.Once your baby is attached, settle back a little for your own comfort and so that more of their weight is taken by your body.Laid back breastfeedingRemember that Biological Nurturing™ positions aren’t just for the first week or two. They can be really useful later on when you want to relax, and especially if you are breastfeeding more than one baby or if your baby is fussy or unwell.The cross-cradle holdThe cross-cradle position can be useful in the early days because it gives you more control in guiding your baby to the breast. It can be uncomfortable to maintain without good support under your arms, especially with larger babies, so once your baby is attached, switch arms as shown in the picture below. After the first few weeks and as your baby grows longer and heavier, you may prefer to use other comfortable holds. Avoid touching the top or back of your baby’s head because it often causes a baby to pull back from the breast. Forcing a baby onto the breast by firmly holding the back of the head usually has the opposite effect and can put a baby off breastfeeding.Cross cradleTuck their whole front against your tummy, their hip near or resting on your thigh.Your hand supports their neck (not the back of the head) with your palm between their shoulder blades.Your other hand is free to shape or stabilise your breast if needed.Make sure your baby isn’t too far round the front—line them up so their eyes and nose are near the nipple.As your baby opens their mouth, give a little push with the palm of your hand to bring their chest in close against you.This will help their head tip back and let them plant their chin deeply against your breast.Once your baby is attached you can bring your  other arm round to support your baby’s body and settle back a little for your own comfort and so that more of his weight is taken by your body. Hold your baby with the arm opposite to the breast he’s going to latch onto.The underarm (clutch or rugby) holdThe underarm hold is useful if you have had acaesarean birth. It helps keep the weight of your baby off your incision. It is also a good position for mothers with flat or inverted nipples and for babies with latch-on or sucking problems because it offers you a good view of baby and breast and control of your baby’s head. You can also feedtwo babies at oncein this position. For larger, longer babies you may need extra cushions behind your back to bring you further forward and allow space for your baby’s length.Your baby’s front is close against your side, with your hand under their shoulders and neck.Your elbow keeps them tucked closely against your body.Your baby approaches your breast from below. This can work well if you have large breasts. If you have smaller breasts you may need to bring your baby into a semi-sitting position.Make sure your baby isn’t too far round the front. You may need a cushion between your back and the chair back to allow room for your baby’s length and prevent them pushing themselves forward with his feet.Side lyingThis side-lying position is helpful if you are recovering from a caesarean birth or an episiotomy and invaluable for nursing in bed during the night.It can take a while to get the knack but it’s well worth persisting because it can make night feeds so much easier.Some mothers decide to sleep with their baby alongside them. Others choose to move their baby back onto a separate sleep surface.Safe Sleep and the Breastfed Babywill help you decide on the safest sleep arrangements for your family, based on your own individual circumstances.• Lie on your side, with your knees bent up and a pillow under your head.• Place your baby on their side facing you so that their body and your body form a V-shape, meeting at your hips, with your nipple level with their nose or eyes.• You can put your arm under your baby’s head as shown, or up by the pillow with your baby lying on the bed.• As your baby latches, give a little push between their shoulder blades to bring their chest in closer and help their head to tip back and their mouth toopen wide.• You may find it helpful to tuck a small pillow or rolled blanket behind the small of your back and/or between your knees.Standing upAt some feeds babies just do better if you stand up. You can sway or bounce gently to help calm your baby, and the lack of a lap can be helpful. As always keep your baby nice and stable and let them lead the way. Try angling their legs down instead of holding them horizontal, and see what happens. Or try starting with them against your shoulder, supporting them as he moves down to the breast. Even when using other positions, sometimes just standing up and sitting down again straight away helps everything settle into a comfortable position.As time goes byWhether you choose to breastfeed sitting up, reclining or lying on your side, you will need to adjust how you support your baby as he grows in length and weight. Use the principles shown here as you experiment with different positions. Sometimes there are physical or medical causes for pain or discomfort such as tongue tie or a thrush infection. If you are still finding it difficult to get comfortable, do persist with seeking further and continued support. There is almost always a breastfeeding solution to breastfeeding problems.

You can also find support and encouragement from breastfeeding mothers in yourlocal LLL group.Written by Sue Upstone, Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGBFurther ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

"LLL is aware that throughout time mothers in many cultures have informally shared their breastmilk and wet nursed among family members and trusted friends. We know that in times of severe maternal illness, death and natural disaster sharing breastmilk can be lifesaving.The World Health Organisation states that if a mother’s own milk is not available then the next best thing is the milk of another woman (1). La Leche League fully supports the use of human milk for babies. We aim to help mothers breastfeed their babies; we also seek to help mothers express and safely store their own milk for their babies. When mothers can’t provide sufficient breast milk themselves we provide information and support to help them find a safe alternative.Can I increase my own supply?Some techniques to try:Increase frequency of nursingmake sure the baby is latched on correctlyoffer both breasts at each feedingYou might also find useful information on our pageIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?and inFurther Reading.In rare circumstances mothers are unable to provide their baby with a full supply of breast milk. Human milk banks provides pasteurised, screened donor milk, which is a good alternative.There are documented benefits and risks to informal milk sharing. Benefits of breast milk include, but are not limited to:optimal nutritioneasy digestibilityimmunological protectionRisks of sharing breast milk can include, but are not limited to:transmission of certain infectious agents, like bacteria or viruses, some of which may be found in milk expressed by asymptomatic womenmedicines and other drugsenvironmental contaminants as a result of unhygienic storage and handling of unprocessed donated milkLLLGB suggests that mothers who wish to obtain breast milk contact licensed human milk banks, or another regulated and medically supervised human milk collection centre.Licensed milk banks require donors to meet specific health requirements before accepting their donated milk. The milk is screened and treated for viruses to eliminate undetected infections it might contain.Women who wish to donate their breastmilk to others can request complete information from a milk bank about how her milk will be used, and she may be able to restrict how it will be used.An LLL Leader may providecontact informationfor non-profit human milk banks, other regulated collection centers, and formal/medically supervised or informal milk-sharing networks but cannot set up or facilitate any type of milk-sharing network.Further ReadingIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Amazing MilkBeginning BreastfeedingNursing SupplementersExpressing Your MilkStoring Your MilkLLLI information and policy on milk sharingIn Praise of at-breast supplementers– a mother’s story  from Breastfeeding MattersOther websitesHuman Milk for Human Babies (HM4HB), theInformed milksharing networkReferencesWHO Infant and Young Child Nutrition[1]http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA55/ea5515.pdfWritten by Anna Burbidge",https://laleche.org.uk/sharing-breastmilk/,Sharing Breastmilk
"The effects of alcohol on your baby are directly related to the amount you drink. When you drink occasionally the amount of alcohol your baby receives has not been proven to be harmful.Things to considerDo I need to pump and dump?Can alcohol affect milk supply?Do I have to pump and dump after drinking alcohol?Alcohol abuse affects the babyLa Leche League International’s Health Advisory CouncilSummaryThings to considerYour baby’s ageA newborn has an immature liver, and will be more affected by alcoholUp until around 3 months of age, infants metabolise alcohol at about half the rate of adultsAn older baby can metabolise alcohol more quickly than a young infantThink about the following:your weight: the heavier you are the more quickly you can metabolise alcoholthe amount you are drinking: the effect of alcohol on the baby is directly related to the amount of alcohol that is consumedWill you be eating? An alcoholic drink consumed with food decreases the absorption rate into the bloodstreamDo I need to pump and dump?Alcohol is present in a woman’s milk at the same level as in her blood. It passes freely into breastmilk and peaks about 30 to 60 minutes after drinking, 60 to 90 minutes when drunk with food.You do not have to pump and dump after drinking alcohol when you’re breastfeeding, except for comfort.As alcohol leaves your bloodstream, it leaves your breastmilk. Alcohol is not “trapped” in breastmilk and pumping and dumping will not remove it. Drinking a lot of water, resting, or drinking coffee will not speed up the rate at which alcohol leaves your body.Can alcohol affect milk supply?Studies have found that babies nurse more frequently when their mother has consumed alcohol. Although letdown is inhibited and milk intake temporarily reduced after a mother has drunk alcohol, babies may compensate by feeding more frequently in the hours after a mother has had a drink.Alcohol abuse affects the babyMaternal blood alcohol levels must attain 300 mg/100ml before significant side effects are reported in the infant.  (80mg/100ml fails the police breath test). If a mother is regularly consuming large amounts of alcohol this could harm the baby. It would be a good idea for a woman to consult a health professional if she has any doubts about the compatibility of her drinking habits with breastfeeding.If you are sober enough to drive you should be sober enough to breastfeed.If consumed in large amounts alcohol can cause drowsiness, deep sleep, weakness, and abnormal weight gain in the infant, and the possibility of decreased milk-ejection reflex in the mother. Mothers who have been drinkingshould not bed-sharewith their babies as their natural reflexes will be affected.La Leche League International’s Health Advisory CouncilDr. Jack Newman MD, FRCPC and Thomas W. Hale, R.Ph. Ph.D, both members of La Leche League International’s Health Advisory Council believe that a mother can drink some alcohol and continue breastfeeding as she normally does. See further reading for more information .SummaryIf you want to drink but are concerned about the effect on your baby, you can use expressed breastmilk.  Alternatively you can wait for the alcohol to clear from your system (about two hours for each drink consumed).  If you become uncomfortable while waiting you can express and discard your milk.Further ReadingSafe sleep and the breastfed babyRead a longer version of this articlehere.NHS guidanceAlcohol while breastfeedingLLLI articlesAlcohol and breastfeedingCopyright LLLGB 2016",https://laleche.org.uk/alcohol-drink/,Alcohol & breastfeeding (quick read)
"Are you experiencing pain while breastfeeding, possibly combined with slow weight gain for your baby? While the vast majority of such breastfeeding problems can be resolved by adjusting positioning and attachment, and with good breastfeeding management, occasionally tongue tie might be the cause of the problem.Tongue tie (ankyloglossia) is caused by a tight or short lingual frenulum (the membrane that anchors the tongue to the floor of the mouth). The frenulum normally thins and recedes before birth. Where this doesn’t happen, the frenulum may restrict tongue mobility. Tongue tie often runs in families and is thought to be more common in boys than girls. There is an association between high or unusual palates and tongue tie, because restricted tongue movement can affect the shape of the palate.Breastfeeding challenges can also occur for other reasons. Identifying the cause is important when deciding on appropriate solutions, so seek help from someone skilled.Identifying tongue tieWhen your baby tries to lift their tongue or move it forwards it may appear misshapen, short or heart-shaped, with the frenulum clearly pulling its centre down and restricting its movement. Or you may be able to see or feel firm tissue where their tongue meets the floor of his mouth. Degrees of tongue tie vary and it can be difficult to diagnose accurately. A short, tight, posterior tongue tie is rarer, but may be particularly hard to spot.How breastfeeding may be affectedTongue tie affects tongue movement to varying degrees. The shorter and tighter it is, the more likely it is to affect breastfeeding. Some babies with a tongue tie breastfeed well from the start, others do so when positioning and attachment are improved. But any tongue tie that restricts normal tongue movement can lead to breastfeeding difficulties. A baby needs to be able to move their tongue freely and extend it over the lower gum with their mouth open wide to be able to breastfeed well. The symptoms below are all associated with poor attachment that may be caused by tongue tie.A baby may:• Be unable to latch on to the breast at all.• Be unable to latch on deeply, causing nipple pain and damage.• Have difficulties staying on the breast, making a clicking sound as he loses suction.• Splutter and choke when coping with fast flowing milk.• Breastfeed constantly to get enough milk.• Have poor weight gain or need supplementation to maintain adequate weight gain.• Develop jaundice that needs treating.• Be fussy at the breast when the milk flow slows.• Develop colic.A mother may experience:• Pain during feeds, with damaged nipples. Her nipple may be compressed or distorted into a wedge shape like that of a new lipstick immediately after feeding, often with a stripe at its tip.• Engorgement, blocked ducts and mastitis because of ineffective milk removal.• Low milk production because of ineffective milk removal.• Oversupply—if her baby compensates for not being able to breastfeed well by nursing very frequently.• Tiredness, frustration and discouragement.• A premature end to breastfeeding.Breastfeeding is important for every babyThough sometimes needed as a temporary supplement if your milk production is very low, introducing infant formula is not the answer. It has short-term and long-term health risks for both your baby and you. A baby with tongue tie can also have difficulties with bottlefeeding. Milk may leak from his mouth during feeds and he may suffer from colic.TreatmentWhere a tongue tie is causing breastfeeding problems, treatment options are available and effective— especially if the treatment is prompt. Although attention to positioning and attachment can help maintain breastfeeding and improve comfort to a certain extent, there is evidence that treating tongue tie by frenotomy (see below) is effective in resolving breastfeeding difficulties. Weight gain can improve dramatically. As well as the continued breastfeeding benefits, continuing to breastfeed after frenotomy maximises a baby’s chance of normal mouth (palate), speech and dental development. This includes tongue mobility for licking and moving particles of food around the mouth, helping prevent tooth decay.Keeping breastfeeding goingMastering the art of breastfeeding can sometimes be a challenge and it takes determination to keep going if you are in pain. The information here can help you keep breastfeeding, both before and after treatment.Soften your breastA baby with tongue tie may find it easier to latch on if your breast is soft so breastfeed frequently to avoid engorgement. When your baby bobs their head and licks the nipple, they naturally makes it easier to latch on. Or you can use reverse pressure softening to move fluids away from the nipple area so your baby can latch on well. Press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple. Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola. You can also press with the sides of your fingers. Place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be. Gently hand express a little milk if needed.Biological nurturing™A baby often instinctively attaches more deeply and comfortably if they can snuggle up close to their mother’s chest for periods of time. Try letting your baby lie on your body as you recline so both their chest and tummy are against you. This kind of ‘laid-back’ breastfeeding contact is known as Biological Nurturing™ and can be done skin-to-skin or with you and your baby lightly clothed—whatever is more comfortable and convenient for you both. Because gravity helps a baby keep their tongue forwards, this can make a real difference to how well your baby feeds and how much milk you make. See picture above and Online Information section for details of an online video.A deeper latchHelp your baby get as deep a latch as possible at the breast. This will maximise the amount of milk they get and minimise nipple pain.If your baby retracts (pulls back) their tongue when they open their mouth, try sliding their chin a little further from the nipple so he can feel the ‘fatter’ part of the breast with his tongue. Denting the breast at the edge of the areola with a finger and placing your baby’s chin in the dent may also help.You could also try placing your thumb or finger near the base of the nipple where your baby’s upper lip will be. If you press, your nipple will tilt away from your baby, presenting them with your breast rather than your nipple. As they open wide, snuggle them in close and use your thumb or finger to tuck the breast into their mouth. Your nipple will be taken in last and unroll in their mouth. If needed, you can then slip your finger out. An LLL Leader can give you further suggestions to help you improve your baby’s positioning and attachmentEncourage tongue mobilityTo encourage your baby to move their tongue forward, you can also try:• Reclining with your baby on top of you. Try leaning forward and back yourself to understand how gravity affects tongue position.• Encouraging them to lick milk from their lips or from your nipple before and after feeds.• Sticking your tongue out at your baby to encourage them to copy you.Maintain milk productionIf your baby is sleepy or has jaundice, or if you have engorgement or inverted nipples, then a tongue tie can make things worse. If they are not able to take enough milk directly at the breast then you will need to express it and give it to your baby until they are able to breastfeed effectively. Express by hand and/or with a pump at least 8 times a day if your baby is not draining the breast well. This will maintain your milk production and ensure they get enough milk.Small amounts of expressed milk can be offered by spoon, cup or syringe while you both learn how to breastfeed. Bottles or dummies can confuse your baby’s sucking technique so consult an LLL Leader about breastfeeding friendly ways to bottlefeed or about using a nursing supplementer. This device delivers extra milk through a tube along your breast as your baby nurses, avoiding the need for bottles.An unusual palateRestricted tongue movement caused by tongue tie may affect the shape of a baby’s palate, leading to a high palate or a bubble palate with a high spot. These may be a factor in broken suction, a clicking sound and pain during breastfeeding. A baby with an unusual palate may also resist a deeper latch due to gagging.The following may help.• Start with a clean finger with closely trimmed nail.• Touch your baby’s lips and wait until they open their mouth.• Gently slide in your finger, pad side up along his hard palate, stopping just before the gag reflex is triggered.Make this a pleasant game and, over a few days, gradually move your finger back to overcome sensitivity. After a tongue tie is divided, a baby’s increased tongue movement helps the palate shape become more normalTreating Tongue TieWhat can be done?Frenotomy—dividing the tongue tie—can dramatically improve breastfeeding comfort and efficiency for both mother and baby. Dividing a tongue tie is a quick and simple procedure. No anaesthetic is needed for a baby under six months of age.There are health professionals around the UK who have been specifically trained to divide tongue ties. For treatment on the NHS, you will need a referral from your midwife, health visitor or GP. Knowledge about tongue ties and how they affect breastfeeding varies, so it is worth persisting and seeking a second opinion. In areas where only GPs can refer, your midwife or health visitor may be able to give a recommendation to your GP or suggest seeing a particular GP. Private treatment may also be an option.  SeeFurther Readingfor information on finding a practitioner trained to divide tongue tiesIs waiting an option?Sometimes a very thin tongue tie breaks spontaneously or can be stretched by gentle massage of the frenulum. The earlier a tongue tie is divided, the easier it is to resolve any breastfeeding difficulties. Dividing a tongue tie in a baby over six months old is also a more complicated procedure and usually requires a general anaesthetic.Frenotomy—what will happen?After the health professional’s initial assessment, your baby will be swaddled and held (often by an assistant) so they stay still during the procedure, which only takes a minute or two. The health professional lifts the tongue and divides the frenulum by cutting it with a pair of round-ended sterile scissors or by cauterising it.Does it hurt?No anaesthetic is needed for a very young baby as having a tongue tie divided only hurts a little, if at all. Some babies protest more at being swaddled than about the treatment. Others sleep right through the procedure! You will be asked to breastfeed your baby as soon as the procedure is over, to offer comfort, clean the wound and get their tongue moving as soon as possible. The inside of a baby’s mouth heals very quickly. The only treatment usually needed is to breastfeed to keep the wound clean and keep his tongue mobile. There may be a white patch under your baby’s tongue, but this heals within 24 to 48 hours.If things don’t resolveUsually a mother notices an instant improvement in her comfort during breastfeeds. Sometimes it takes a week or two for a baby to adjust to their tongue’s greater mobility. An older baby may find it harder to adjust to increased tongue mobility and tongue exercises may be recommended. Occasionally a baby’s frenulum needs dividing a second time, usually because the division was not quite extensive enough the first time. If you suspect that the initial procedure has not resolved your baby’s breastfeeding problems arrange another consultation. Do persist with finding solutions. If several factors are involved it can take time and expertise to resolve the problem. An LLL Leader can suggest further paths to explore and provide ongoing support.Painful nipplesUsing different feeding positions can help if breastfeeding is painful. Or use the position you find most comfortable until your nipples heal. Check your baby’s attachment later in the feed—if they slip down your nipple, this may cause you pain. Reclining breastfeeding positions or extra support under your arms may help.Ask your LLL Leader aboutbreast compression,which can help your baby get more milk quicker. An increase in milk flow may also help them breastfeed more effectively.Hand expressto stimulate milk flowbefore feeding. Or start on the least painful side, switching sides once your milk lets down. Pain can reduce milk flow, leading to engorgement and mastitis. Ask your doctor, midwife or health visitor about using a suitable painkiller. Applying warmth and using gentle massage and relaxation exercises just before feeds can help milk to flow.Moist wound healingWhen the underlying problem is corrected, moist wound healing can help your nipples heal without scab formation. After each feed gently pat your nipples dry to remove surface wetness. Apply a tiny smear of ultra pure modified lanolin to each nipple, dabbing it on rather than rubbing. Hydrogel pads without a cloth backing can also be used.Blood from cracked nipplesBlood from cracked nipples is not harmful to your baby. You can continue to breastfeed whilst working to improve positioning and attachment.If healing is slowOnce your baby starts latching on well you should feel more comfortable and notice signs of healing within a few days. If not, visit your GP—sometimes a bacterial or fungal infection can prevent healing. Continued pain may be a sign that treatment (or further treatment) of your baby’s tongue tie is needed.Seek supportThis is a time when the support of other mothers in your local LLL group can be invaluable.

"Usually it’s possible to end breastfeeding gradually. However, a mother may find herself in a situation where she needs to stop breastfeeding straight away, for example to start treatment for a serious medical condition such as cancer, or, sadly, if her baby has died.Sudden weaningStopping breastfeeding suddenly can lead to potential problems— weaning gradually allows time both for milk production to reduce and stop, and for a baby to adjust to other ways of feeding and comfort.It’s normal to feel overwhelmed and under pressure if it’s been suggested that you stop breastfeeding without delay. Enforced weaning is not easy on either mother or child, but you may have more options than you think.In the ﬁrst yearIn the first year, even if your baby has started eating solid foods, milk will remain his main source of nutrition and energy. Unmodified cows milk is unsuitable as a main drink for babies under a year old. For guidance on preparing infant formula see the NHS leaflet Guide to bottle feeding:http://www.unicef.org.uk/BabyFriendly/Resources/Resources-for-parents/Department-of-Health-bottle-feeding-leafletWhether you choose to use a bottle, an open cup or a spouted beaker when replacing breastfeeds will depend on your individual circumstances. Introduce bottles only if your baby seems to need the comfort of sucking from one. An older baby or toddler may prefer to drink from an open cup anyway.Photo courtesy of Kimberly Seals AllersWeaning an older baby or toddlerThe following ideas may be useful if you need to wean quickly.• Change your daily routines so your child is less likely to ask to nurse.• Offer drinks and snacks before you expect your child to want to nurse.• Do what you can to keep your child happy—whether by using lots of distractions or by keeping things calm.• See tips in our postThinking of Weaning.Is weaning really necessary?Mothers may be told they need to wean their baby from the breast for a variety of reasons. Before starting to wean, it’s worth double-checking that the test, medication or other treatment you need really does mean you shouldn’t breastfeed. While any situation or drug needs to be checked individually, many medications are compatible with breastfeeding. If a medication is incompatible with breastfeeding, an alternative may be available that is compatible. So it may be possible to continue breastfeeding after all. More information on this can be found inWhen a Breastfeeding Mother is Unwelland an LLL Leader can help locate information on speciﬁc medications.When a short-term test, or a medication or other treatment is incompatible with breastfeeding, temporary weaning is always an option. You can maintain your milk production by expressing your milk and then discarding it. Once the test or treatment is completed you can return to breastfeeding as before—an LLL Leader can share information on getting your baby back to the breast and increasing your milk if necessary.Find local LLL supporthere.How quickly do you need to wean?If you have a few weeks, cutting out one daily feed no more often than every two or three days allows your milkproduction to decrease slowly with little or no fullness and discomfort. The rate at which feeds can be dropped without discomfort varies from mother to mother.If you need to stop nursing your baby immediately, you can use an automatic or semi-automatic electric breast pump or hand expression to relieve discomfort while you decrease your milk production. This will mean the hormonal changes are more gradual. If you haven’t expressed your milk before, you may need a little practice.Breastfeeding is more than just a method of feeding. It’s also a familiar source of closeness and comfort, so your baby will need lots of extra love and attention when you stop nursing. If you are coping with illness this may not be easy—practical support from others will be a big help.Looking after yourselfBreastfeeding can make life easier if you are coping with illness. If you have to stop breastfeeding quickly, you’ll need to devote lots of time and energy to your baby to keep him happy while he copes with the changes.Look after yourself by:• Reducing unnecessary outside commitments and limiting housework to essentials.• Enlisting the help of your partner and any older children with housework and entertaining your little one.• Using any outside help you can.• Resting whenever possible, including lying down with your baby or toddler to sleep in the day.• Having a quiet time, with quiet activities in a safe room. You may be able to rest, even if you can’t sleep.• Getting to bed a little earlier to have a longer period of uninterrupted sleep.Slow Milk Production GraduallyIf you suddenly stop nursing your baby, your body continues to produce milk. A good way of slowing milk production gradually is to pump or hand express just enough milk at regular intervals to avoid discomfort. In this way milk production will slowly decrease. Keeping a little milk ﬂowing prevents your breasts becoming overly full and engorged, which could lead to a blocked duct, mastitis or even a breast abscess. It also makes it more comfortable to hold, carry and cuddle your baby if you need to distract him from nursing.Express milk by hand, with a pump or both until your breasts feel comfortable and the milk ﬂow slows. The younger your baby is, the more care you will need to take to reduce your milk slowly and gradually. Aim to produce a comfortable fullness in your breasts by expressing less often than your baby was nursing. This fullness will then help slow your milk production. If your baby was breastfeeding about every two hours, you could try expressing milk every three hours or so at ﬁrst to relieve excessive fullness. You might need to express at night too to start with.As well as cutting out a whole expressing session every two or three days, you can also reduce the time at each session. Expressing less milk each time will also help limit how much milk you produce.Shorten sessions by a minute every few days, for example, but watch out for signs of engorgement due to insufﬁcient removal of milk.If your breasts become ﬁrm, hard, shiny or lumpy, take action without delay to relieve this.Hand express or gently pump enough milk to make your breasts comfortable. Make sure you drain milk from each part of the breast.Keeping comfortable• Applying warmth for a few minutes, or having a comfortably hot shower or bath can make it easier to express milk as the warm water may help you relax and stimulate your let-down.• Ice packs can provide relief from swelling. Use an ice pack large enough to cover most of the breast, wrapped in a lightweight towel to protect your skin. Leave it in place for 15-20 minutes. Crushed ice in a plastic bag or a bag of frozen vegetables can be used (the latter can be thawed and refrozen several times, before discarding).• Breast pads can help with leaking. You may be more comfortable wearing a ﬁrm bra for support—possibly a size larger than usual. But note that any consistent pressure on the breast can cause a blocked duct, or mastitis.• Drink according to your thirst. Since salt causes the body to retain ﬂuids, it may be helpful to restrict your salt intake until any feelings of fullness are gone.• Pain and swelling can be relieved by a suitable over-the-counter anti-inﬂammatory medication from your pharmacist.Symptoms of mastitisIf one area of your breast appears to be inﬂamed—tender, red and hot—and if you have a fever over 38.4°C or ﬂu-like symptoms, you may have mastitis or a breast infection. Continue to express milk focusing particularly on softening the inﬂamed area. If it does not improve contact your doctor who may prescribe an antibiotic.More information on dealing with mastitisWhen you have stopped nursing or expressingOnce you have stopped breastfeeding or expressing milk and the feelings of fullness have gone, your breasts will continue to produce small amounts of milk for some time. Some mothers ﬁnd their breasts start to feel full and uncomfortable a few days or more after they’ve stopped feeding, or expressing. Treating this fullness by expressing small amounts of milk every so often will help prevent it getting worse.It’s not unusual to be able to express drops of milk months or even years after weaning, although producing signiﬁcant amounts long afterwards could suggest a hormonal imbalance and is worth checking with your doctor.Sometimes the sudden hormonal changes following an abrupt end to breastfeeding may bring on or worsen depression. Do talk to your GP or health visitor if depression intensiﬁes or lasts more than two weeks, as effective treatments are available.FeelingsHaving no choice about ending breastfeeding may leave you and your child feeling frustrated, angry or sad, especially if your child still very much enjoys nursing. Neither of you want to wean but it’s the only option. It might help to say to your child something like, “It’s hard for you, I know. You’d really like to feed. I’d like to be able to feed you, too. But we have to stop now and I’m sorry. I still love you.”Many people think nursing doesn’t matter once a baby can eat solid foods and that stopping breastfeeding is easy. They may ﬁnd it hard to understand the distress you feel. Seek out support from those who do understand how hard it is.

"Babies can be unsettled for many reasons and it can sometimes take time and effort to work out the cause. Our pageThe Unhappy Breastfed Babycan help you determine whether your baby’s behaviour is due to something other than an allergy.But when you have ruled out most of the obvious causes and your baby is still, unhappy, colicky, experiencing dry and itchy skin or passing mucousy stools you may wonder whether they could be reacting to something in their diet or environment, or something in your own diet.Certain medical conditions can have symptoms similar to those of an allergic reaction. It may be wise to rule these out before deciding whether a baby’s symptoms are due to an allergy or food intolerance.A baby’s immune system is immature at birth.Colostrum, or early milk, is rich in antibodies, particularly secretory IgA (SIgA), which provide a protective coating inside a baby’s intestines1. Mature breastmilk continues to provide protection, helping to prevent potential allergens from reaching a baby’s blood.Exclusive breastfeeding generally helps to protect against allergy but it may still occur.If any immediate family member ( siblings or parents) has an allergy eczema, hay fever or asthma, it makes it more likely that the baby could develop allergies2.Food intoleranceA food intolerance does not involve an allergic reaction but can cause similar symptoms. It occurs when a baby has difficulty digesting a particular food. You may not need to stop giving your baby a food to which he is intolerant—reducing the amount may be enough.Food allergyA food allergy occurs when a baby has an immune response to specific foods. There are two types of food allergy reactions; immediate and delayed. A baby can have either or both3.Immediate reactions are also called IgE-mediated alllergies. This is because the baby’s immune system creates specific IgE antibodies to a certain food. If a baby is given the specific food they are allergic to, the IgE antibodies will recognise it and cause the rapid release of chemicals, including histamine, that trigger inflammation and allergic symptoms. Symptoms appear within minutes, or up to 2 hours after eating the food responsible3.Delayed reactions are called non-IgE mediated allergies because they are not controlled by IgE. Instead it is believed such reactions are regulated by immune cells. Symptoms appear 4-72 hours after eating the food3.It is wise to see your GP or health visitor if your baby is showing signs of allergy, but some symptoms are more worrying than others.Seek immediate medical help if your baby has signs of an anaphylactic reaction: sudden onset of breathing difficulties, swelling, or collapse, with or without a rash, after physical contact or eating a particular food.Allergy symptomsFood allergy symptoms occur in several different body systems; the tummy, airways and skin. An Allergic baby will usually have symptoms in more than one body system, but need not experience all the symptoms to indicate allergy. Many of the following allergy symptoms can also occur in normally developing children for other reasons.IgE mediated symptoms3Non-IgE mediated symptoms3TimeImmediate: within minutes or up to 2 hoursDelayed:within 4–72 hoursWhen nursingBaby hungry for the breast but pulls away after a minute or two, arching the back and screaming*SkinItchingInflammation**Hives/nettle rashSwelling, usually around the lips, face and eyesItchingInflammation**Eczema (dermatitis)TummyItchy mouthNauseaColicky tummy pain***VomitingDiarrhoeaRefluxLoose or frequent poosBlood or mucus in pooTummy painInfantile colic***Food refusal or aversionConstipationInflammation in the nappy area**AirwaysCough, chest tightness, wheeze, noisy breathing, trouble breathingItchy nose, sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, conjunctivitisCough, chest tightness, wheeze, noisy breathing, trouble breathingOtherAnaphylaxis: sudden onset of breathing difficulties, swelling, or collapse with or without a rashReduced growth, along with oneor more tummy symptoms aboveLethargy*This may also be caused by a fast let-down. See Too Much Milk and Oversupply formore information if you think that this may apply to you.**Inflammation appears red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin.***Colic is defined as repeated episodes of excessive and inconsolable crying in an infant thatotherwise appears to be healthy and thriving.Environmental triggersAn irritant is something that causes damage to the skin. Eczema (also known as dermatitis) and dry skin rashes can be caused by mild irritants such as bubble bath, baby wipes, skin cream, fabric conditioner or laundry detergent4. Many mothers find avoiding unnecessary products or using a different product improves things. Reading packaging can help avoid problems with common irritants such as lanolin and perfumes. Use fragrance-free products whenever possible. Be aware that herbals can also be allergenic and irritant – being natural does not necessarily mean a product is any less irritating. Hay fever symptoms and other ear, nose and throat symptoms can be caused by spring and summer pollens and other airborne allergens such as dust.Identifying the problem foodIf your baby is having only your milkFood allergens in the mother’s diet can pass through into the breastmilk so a breastfed baby can have an allergic response or intolerance to something in the mother’s diet.Consider:Are you taking any laxatives, medicines, vitamins, iron tablets or other supplements?Do you drink lots of caffeinated drinks? Coffee, cola, tea and some pain relievers, cold remedies, weight control aids and diuretics contain caffeine. Chocolate contains a substance called theobromine that can have a similar effect to caffeine if you eat a lot.Have you recently eaten a new food or any particular food in large amounts?Are there any foods that you don’t like but have decided to eat during pregnancy or breastfeeding because you think they will be good for you and your baby?Are there foods that you crave? What foods do you snack on when you have a bad day?Depending on how sensitive your baby is, removing or cutting down on the offending items in your diet may well solve the problem.If your baby is also having infant formula or solidsThe majority of babies don’t need anything other than mother’s milk before about six months — no infant formula, drinks or solids. Babies who have started solids can be sensitive to certain common foods until they are a little older.Consider:Could your baby be reacting to the drinks or solid foods he is having?Is he on any medication or vitamin supplements?Could he be receiving other drinks such as infant formula or juice, or solid food, from anyone else without your knowledge?Infant formula or follow-on formula is usually cow’s milk-based and a common, avoidable cause of allergy. Babies do not need follow-on formula at all.Removing the offending food from your baby’s diet for now should solve the problem; they may be able to tolerate it in a few months time. If you think your baby may be reacting to a prescribed medication that they have to take, speak to your doctor, who may be able to prescribe an alternative.Common problem foods5Common problem foods which may be eaten by a baby or a breastfeeding mother include:Milk and other dairy products such as butter, yoghurt, cheese, whey, casein, caseinate, lactoseEggPeanutSoyWheatFishSesame seeds (in tahini and hummus)Lupin/lentils (including chickpeas which are in hummus)Shellfish; crustaceans (e.g. crab, lobster, crayfish, shrimp, prawn), molluscs (e.g. mussels, oysters, squid)Fenugreek is closely related to peanutsTree nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, etc.)Celery and celeriacMustardCommon foods that can be involved in intolerance or irritation but not usually allergy:Sulphur dioxide and sulphites, benzoates, glutamate, salicylates, dietary aminesCitrus fruits, strawberries, tomatoesCertain additives, artificial colourings, flavourings and preservativesThese can turn up in the most unexpected places so do check everything consumed including drinks and medicines. For example, some juice drinks contain milk, and wine can contain milk, egg or sulphites.Cutting out suspected foodsIf your baby is exclusively breastfed, you may need to follow an elimination – reintroduction diet. It can help to keep a food and symptom diary.When eliminating major food groups take care to ensure you continue to eat a healthy and balanced diet. Your GP may be able to refer you to a dietician if you wish.Only cut out one food at a time and allow 2–4 weeks to see if your baby’s symptoms improve. If there is no improvement in this time, then the food is unlikely to be the culprit and can be reintroduced3. Consider cutting out a different food.If symptoms do improve, reintroduce the food slowly to confirm the food allergy. However, if your baby has previously experienced a severe or immediate reaction, ask your GP for specialist support before reintroducing the food.Note: Usually a cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) predicts an allergy to other animal milks (e.g. goat or sheep milk), and in some cases soya. If you plan to cut out dairy you may wish to cut out other animal milks and soya at the same time, then reintroduce them each individually.Seek immediate medical help if your baby has shown anaphylactic signs, such as a rapidly developing rash, breathing difficulties, or swelling.A note on eczemaElimination – reintroduction diets should not be done due to the presence of eczema alone.Some children who have a food allergy do have eczema, but most children who have eczema do not have a food allergy. If the only symptom is eczema it is unlikely to be caused by a food allergy. It is worth noting that frequently eating a particular food may mean a baby learns to tolerate it. If the food is stopped, for example during an elimination diet, there is a risk that tolerance may stop and an IgE mediated allergy (including possible anaphylaxis) can form. If you think your baby’s eczema is due to a food allergy it is best to speak with your GP about allergy testing or to get referred to an allergy specialist6.Introducing solid foodsHuman milk contains tiny traces of whatever foods a mother herself has been eating. This is the ideal way to prepare a baby gently for the eventual introduction of solids. The best foods for your baby are usually healthy foods selected from your diet. Solids can be introduced when your baby can sit up (with or without support) and starts reaching out for the food on your plate. For more information, seeStarting Solid Food.If your baby is under the care of a paediatrician for allergies, talk to your specialist team about how to introduce specific allergenic foods.Body tolerance levels can changeBeing allergic or intolerant to something means that your body is sensitised to it, but the symptoms you display may vary in each particular instance; sometimes you may not display any symptoms. Your body’s allergen tolerance level changes based on many factors including stress and your general health, so its ability to react to immune threats also varies. If your immune system is affected by more stressors than usual, you may show symptoms of an allergy/intolerance more readily.Seek supportIt can be quite an effort to be an allergy detective with a fussy baby on your hands, so seek information and support. The good news is that small changes to your diet could make a big difference to a baby with a food allergy or intolerance.An LLL Leader can help you determine the most likely cause of your baby’s symptoms.Local LLL groupsare great for practical and moral support and you may find others there who have had similar experiences. Your GP or health visitor can help diagnose food allergy and refer you to specialist services for testing and advice.Did you know?If a baby reacts when their mother drinks milk or has dairy products, this is a sensitivity to cow’s milk protein, not lactose intolerance.Most infant formulas contain cow’s milk, often referred to as whey based or casein based.Soya, the basis of some infant formulas, is also a common allergen.Infant formula may contain fish oils and vegetable oils (e.g. palm, rapeseed, coconut, sunflower).Medicines and supplements can contain other ingredients that are potentially allergenic.If you or a member of your immediate family has an allergy or intolerance, your baby is more likely to have one too1.FAQsQ. Do I have to give up breastfeeding if my baby is allergic to something in my milk?A. No; eliminating the offending food from your diet will remove the allergen from your breast milk enabling you to continue breastfeeding if you wish to. See sectionCutting out suspected food.Q. Will my baby outgrow his food allergy?A. Possibly; some children do, some do not. Children are most likely to grow out of cows’ milk, egg and soy allergies.Q. I thought I was not meant to feed my baby egg/peanut/etc. until they were over 1 year old?A. This was old advice. Recent research shows introducing allergenic foods from around 6 months old may help the baby to learn to tolerate the food. Introducing the food later can make it more likely that the baby will develop an allergy to the food.Q. What’s the difference between cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) and lactose intolerance?A. True lactose intolerance (reduced capacity to digest lactose) is very rare in babies and is diagnosed within days of birth. Temporary lactose intolerance or lactose overload (too much lactose for the baby to digest) can cause tummy symptoms similar to an allergy. Lactose is produced in the breast, regardless of the mother’s diet. Seek support if you suspect your baby has symptoms of lactose overload. CMPA is an immune reaction and can cause symptoms in many body systems. Breastfeeding mothers of children with CMPA generally need to exclude all cow’s milk protein from their diet – including milk, cheese, yogurt etc. See sectionCutting out suspected food.Q. Should I avoid eating a food my baby is allergic to if I become pregnant again?A. No; as long as you are not allergic to it and it is not one the foods you usually need to avoid in pregnancy (such as undercooked meat) eating a particular food in pregnancy has no effect on the development of allergy.Q. Is my baby allergic to a food because I ate it whilst pregnant?A. No; eating a particular food in pregnancy has no effect on the development of allergy.Q. If I have another baby will it develop allergies too?A. Possibly; if you have a sibling with allergies you are more likely to be genetically predisposed to develop allergies. However, having an older sibling decreases the risk of developing allergy.Written by Sue Cardus, Robyn Halliday and mothers of La Leche League Great BritainEndnotesAndreas, N., Kampmann, B., Le-Doare, K.

"There are many causes of nipple and breast pain. Nipple thrush is one possible cause, although it is often wrongly or over-diagnosed before other possibilities have been investigated. A skilled breastfeeding supporter can help you rule out other possible causes before a thrush diagnosis is made.What is thrush?Thrush is a yeast infection, usually caused by the fungusCandida albicans. Thrush likes warm, dark and moist environments, and it might grow on your nipple.Candida albicansis naturally present in our bodies and usually it causes us no harm; however, certain things can create an imbalance in the body and cause an overgrowth. These include:Previous nipple damage.If you have thrush affecting any other part of your body, or if another family member has a thrush infection.If you or your baby have been treated with antibiotics or corticosteroids.If you take the contraceptive pill.Bottle or dummy use, especially in the early weeks after birth.Anaemia or diabetes.Exhaustion and stress.Diagnosing thrushThrush is diagnosed by symptoms and/or by looking at mother and baby. Sometimes culture samples are taken. This is known as swabbing.There are different views about swabbing. Some breastfeeding organisations recommend swabbing to confirm thrush1. However, some studies say that swabbing is neither reliable nor accurate, as Candida can be part of the normal healthy skin surface. Although theCandidaspecies can be easily singled out in the laboratory when present in milk, there is a lack of consistent rules for milk sample, collection, storage and analysis globally.2Swabbing is more complex than just ‘taking a test’. It does not always give a clear thrush diagnosis, or confirm if the pain is due to thrush or a bacterial infection. The roles of bacteria and yeast in relation to nipple and breast pain during breastfeeding remain unclear. It is also possible to have bothStaph.andCandidaon the nipples without any symptoms.Thrush symptomsThere can be many causes of ‘thrush-like’ symptoms. Nipple and breast pain is likely to be caused by something OTHER THAN thrush if:Breastfeeding has always been painful.Your nipples are flattened, wedge-shaped or appear white after feeds.Your baby has no symptoms.Signs of thrush in the nursing parent may include:A burning feeling in the nipples, especially after every feed.Itchy nipples that may be sensitive to touch.Flaking and/or shiny skin on the nipple or areola. Nipple skin and areola may be red on lighter skin and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin. This can be more difficult to see on darker skin tones.White patches/tiny blisters on the nipple or areola.A loss of colour in the nipple or areola.A nipple wound which is not healing despite appropriate management.Nipple pain which:Gets worse during feeds and may continue after a feed.Begins suddenly after a period of pain-free breastfeeding.Happens on both sides.According to research, thrush is more likely to be a cause of painful nursing if the following symptoms occur together:Shiny nipple/areola with stabbing painFlaky nipple/areola and mammary pain.3Pain may be felt deep in the breast; however, deep shooting pain between feeds, previously said to be a secondary infection in the milk ducts, is more likely to have a different cause.4Signs of thrush in the baby include:White patches on the cheeks, tongue, roof of mouth or gums. When wiped off they may look red or bleed.Nappy rash.Fussing during and between feeds due to pain.A white coating on the tongue alone is not a sign of thrush as most nursing babies have a white, milky coating on their tongue (sometimes this may be as a result of poor tongue function). Nappy rash and fussiness may also have other causes.Not Thrush? Alternative causesOther conditions that can result in ‘thrush-like’ symptoms may include:Bacterial infectionBacterial and thrush infections of the nipple can have similar symptoms, such as burning pain and soreness.Staphylococcus aureus (Staph.)is the most common bacteria associated with breast infection. With a bacterial infection of the nipple there may be:Yellow pus in the damaged area.Yellow scabs or crusty areas on the nipple.5It is possible for you to have both thrush and a bacterial infection.Shallow latchWhen the latch is shallow, the nipple is squashed, causing pain on the nipple and sometimes deeper within the breast. This may damage the nipple and increase the possibility of a bacterial infection. Even when thrush is the cause of sore nipples, a deeper latch can make it less painful.You can read more aboutPositioning and Attachment here.Skin conditionsSkin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis, can affect the nipple area.  Some people may also have sensitivities to nipple balms containing lanolin.  If you have a history of skin allergies or a similar problem elsewhere on your body, discuss this with your GP. A dermatology referral is sometimes necessary.You can read more aboutcauses of nipple painhere.Subacute MastitisMastitis is inflammation of the breast. This may or may not be caused by a bacterial infection.Often, the general term ‘mastitis’ is used to mean one type of breast inflammation. However, it may help to think of mastitis as being on a spectrum, with blocked ducts at one end and abscess at the other.Different types of bacteria may be involved in breast inflammation. Some of these do not cause fever or flu-like symptoms, but you may still experience painful breastfeeding, needle-like burning pain and engorgement. Some researchers have suggested the term ‘subacute mastitis’ to describe inflammation of the breast without fever or flu-like symptoms. These researchers believe that the term ‘mammary candidiasis’ (thrush) should be avoided and replaced by ‘subacute mastitis’.6,7You can read more aboutmastitis and treatment of mastitis here.VasospasmVasospasm is a sudden narrowing of the blood vessels. The main cause of nipple vasospasm is a shallow latch. When the nipple is squashed it may turn white or change shape. As blood flows back to the nipple, it causes pain on the nipple and deeper in the breast. Deep breast pain is sometimes called ‘Mammary Constriction Syndrome’. Tension and positioning may add to deep breast or muscle pain.Vasospasm is also connected with the circulatory condition Raynaud’s Phenomenon. A history of Raynaud’s may increase the likelihood of it happening during breastfeeding. Symptoms may happen in response to cold and separately from breastfeeding.For more information seeFurther Reading.Thrush treatmentsWhen thrush is diagnosed, it is recommended that both mother and baby are treated at the same time, even if one is symptom free, as they may pass a thrush infection back and forth between them.Breastfeeding should continue if thrush is diagnosed.Medications for the nursing parent:The most effective treatment for topical thrush is Miconazole (Daktarin) cream (2%), which should be applied to the nipple in small amounts after every feed. In mild cases, expect improvement within a couple of days. In more severe cases, it may take 3 to 5 days or longer. Sometimes, symptoms get worse before they get better.8If nipples are very inflamed, a mild steroid cream (hydrocortisone 1%) can be used to facilitate healing.If symptoms do not improve, oral fluconazole may be required in addition to the above. A higher initial dose of 150-400mg is prescribed, followed by 100-200mg daily for at least 10 days. It may take a week or longer for the pain to disappear.9Mothers may also be prescribed nystatin (Nystan) cream or ointment, or clotrimazole (Canestan) cream. However, both are considered to be less effective than other options and clotrimazole is associated with allergic reactions.10Thrush can spread to other family members. Therefore, it may be necessary to treat partners and, if breastfeeding more than one child, the sibling.Comfort optionsRinse nipples with clean water and let them air dry after each feeding.Place something cold on your nipples before nursing. If cold or air drying increases the pain, it may be related to nipple vasospasm (see above).Take mild over-the-counter pain medication.In the short term, express milk and offer it to your baby by another means if feeding is too painful.Medications for the baby:Miconazole (Daktarin) oral gel four times a day after feeds. Manufacturers recommend that this is not used in babies under 4 months due to risk of choking. Healthcare providers must ensure that the parent/carer is aware of how to apply the gel safely if prescribed under this age.11Nystatin (Nystatin) oral suspension may be prescribed, but this is considered less effective than miconazole gel.Neither miconazole gel or nystatin suspension should be applied to the mother’s nipples.Non-medical treatment options:Practical, self-help measures you can take to combat thrush alongside medication include:Frequent hand washing, particularly after nappy changes or using the toilet.Having a separate towel for each person in the family, or at least for you and your baby.Keeping nipples dry. Avoid breast pads, if possible, or throw away/change frequently.Wearing 100% cotton bras and underwear.Washing towels/clothing at 50 °C or above. A hot iron can also kill yeasts.Washing and sterilising dummies, nipple shields, teats and toys frequently.Replacing toothbrushes, toiletries and cosmetics.Reducing sugar, yeast, dairy products and artificial sweeteners.Rinsing nipples with vinegar in water or baking soda in water after every feed.Switching to a non-antibacterial hand soap.Taking herbal supplements and vitamins, such as grapefruit seed extract, garlic, B vitamins and zinc.Anecdotally, some mothers find it helpful to take a probiotic, such as lactobacillus acidophilus.If there is no improvement following prescription medications and self-care measures, then it may be worth considering if the original diagnosis of thrush is correct.Expressing milkPreviously, parents were advised to avoid expressing and storing milk during a thrush infection to avoid possible re-infection, as freezing does not kill yeast. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that this will happen.If you are worried about using expressed/stored milk during a yeast infection, you can either use it while you and your baby are being treated for thrush, or you can warm the milk to 63 °C for 30 minutes to kill bacteria and yeast, before cooling and offering.Current/ongoing researchResearch has been carried out on both breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding, non-pregnant women in order to learn more about yeast infections of the nipple and reliable ways of confirming this.There are different views about the presence of nipple thrush and how accurately it is diagnosed. One study suggests that the evidence supporting a link between nipple/breast pain and thrush is “non-scientific” and largely anecdotal, without the support of a proper microbiological analysis.12Others believe that since thrush does not grow on normal skin, damage of the nipple and areola as a result of a shallow latch is the real problem and that, unless this is dealt with, nipple thrush will remain difficult to treat.13In summaryCandida albicansis naturally present in our bodies and finding an overgrowth can be difficult. Furthermore, the relationship between and the role of fungus and bacteria in relation to nipple/breast pain is unclear.More research is needed to understand how common nipple thrush is and to find reliable ways of confirming this.Further LLLGB readingBlocked Ducts & MastitisComfortable BreastfeedingNipple Pain – Why and What to do?Positioning & AttachmentThe Unhappy Breastfed BabyReferences1.The Breastfeeding Network Drugs in Breastmilk Information.

"Lynsey Hansford looks at some of the amazing benefits of skin-to-skin in the hours and days after birth.Skin-to-skin has become a birth plan buzzword. The term has penetrated ‘birthspeak’ and, in my view, is at risk of being treated as a trend that is only paid lip service in the immediate postpartum period. I did just this with my first child! I knew skin-to-skin was something I *should* be doing but didn’t really know why or what it should look like.I mention skin-to-skin a lot in my voluntary work supporting mothers, the evidence shows it is something of a panacea for mother-baby pairs. I wonder if it is sometimes overlooked as a suggestion because it is such a simple idea; putting your bare skin to your baby’s bare skin is not difficult, radical or revolutionary.Looking at the research on skin to skin is important in understanding its value and how we can make it work for us. It’s absolutely not just for mothers having a natural, vaginal birth, it doesn’t need to be discarded from your birth plan if labour doesn’t progress as you’d hoped and it doesn’t need to be forgotten after the first hours of your baby’s life. It is a valuable mothering tool and at the very least, it can do no harm. Below is a small sample of the research on skin-to-skin, I have included links at the bottom of this post that will lead you to many more.So here comes the science…Research showed that skin-to-skin contact, early suckling, or both, in the two hour period following birth had a positive affect on the mother-baby relationship when the baby reached 1 year old, when compared with mother-baby pairs who had been separated. NHS care in the UK should now reflect the importance of keeping mama and baby together after birth. Also consider that this study showed that swaddling reduced the mother’s responsiveness to her baby.(1. Bystrova K et al., 2009)A Polish study showed that skin-to-skin contact for longer than 20 minutes after birth increased the duration of exclusive breastfeeding.(2. Mikiel-Kostyra et al., 2002)You may have heard of the ‘gentle caesarean’ where some skin-to-skin time can still be enjoyed by the mother-baby pair, in contrast to traditional caesarean procedures. A study has shown that the complications rates in 144 ‘gentle caesareans’ were similiar to or lower than those for traditional caesarean births. Not directly related to the value of skin-to-skin but helpful for mothers who have a c-section to be aware that this is not necessarily a reason to forego the known benefits of skin-to-skin contact. If you are in a position to do so, agree this with your caregivers beforehand.(3. Magee S. R. et al., 2014)We shouldn’t forget the value of skin-to-skin with dad where it isn’t possible with mum. A small 2007 study showed babies cried less and calmed quicker on spending skin-to-skin time with dad whilst mum was in recovery post c-section, compared to babies kept in a bassinet for this time. My personal opinion is that the results would be the same with any loving, caring, warm-bodied adult for eg. mother’s partner who is not the baby’s father, grandparent, other relative or friend.(4. Erlandsson K et al., 2007)A Swedish study looked at slightly older babies (1-16 weeks) with severe problems latching on to the breast. It investigated if skin-to-skin contact could positively affect the baby’s ability to latch, compared to a group where the baby was clothed. The skin-to-skin babies were more able to latch correctly and successfully suckle at the breast and their mothers felt more positive and experienced less pain. I love that this shows us how something as simple as closeness and bare skin cuddles with our baby can help get the nursing relationship back on the right track and that even severe latch problems are fixable.(5. Svensson KE et al., 2013)So now you know how awesome skin-to-skin can be…but it is only an option, maybe skin-to-skin doesn’t feel right for you? I believe that the process of labouring, birthing and feeding your baby is a robust one, we are meant to survive. Somewhere in between all the research, information and options there is something for you and your family.I also talk often aboutBiological Nurturing, aka laid-back breastfeeding. Suzanne Colson studied the positions in which the innate breastfeeding behaviours of the mother-baby pair worked best. There is a lot of information on her website about how you can make her findings work for you. In her book,An Introduction to Biological Nurturing: New Angles on Breastfeeding (2010), she acknowledges that not all mothers will feel comfortable with skin-to-skin and states that these positions can be effectively used when clothed.When birth doesn’t go to plan, do what you can, when you can. This is no time for guilt, sometimes circumstances get in the way of our best-laid plans. I will repeat, I believe the process of labouring, birthing and feeding your baby is a robust one and can survive a veer off course. Start skin-to-skin as soon as you and your baby can manage, some medications might affect you and your baby’s innate behaviours. Be patient, have faith and seek skilled help for your particular situation early.I wish I’d known all of this during my first pregnancy, my last baby is growing up fast and I am making the most of every bare skin cuddle opportunity. Based on a very small sample of one toddler, I can also tell you that 19 month olds crave skin-to-skin and may indicate this by taking their clothes off and climbing inside your jumper.

"Weaning is the process whereby a child learns to take nourishment other than his mother’s milk. It starts when the child is introduced to foods and drinks in addition to breastmilk, and ends when he ﬁnally stops nursing.Introducing a baby to the exciting world of food alongside breastfeeding is covered inStarting Solid Food. Here we concentrate on situations when mothers plan to cut down or stop breastfeeding their babies or toddlers and we will be using the word ‘weaning’ to refer to this process. A baby is usually ready to start tasting solid foods at around six months old, but it’s often some time before he is ready to eat substantial amounts. Until then, milk remains his main source of nutrition and calories.Gradual weaningSince it is normal for babies to continue to breastfeed into the second year or beyond, the weaning period may last months or years. Ending breastfeeding abruptly can be physically and emotionally traumatic for both mother and baby and is best avoided when possible. Weaning gradually over a period of weeks or months allows breastfeeding to end in a comfortable way. Natural weaning, where mum and child end breastfeeding very gradually in a mutually acceptable way, is another option.Breastmilk continues to be a valuable source of nutrition and immunity for as long as nursing continues. Nursing toddlers have fewer illnesses and breastfeeding promotes proper mouth development. Your own risk of developing breast cancer is lowered the longer you breastfeed. Nursing is a valuable mothering tool and many mothers ﬁnd that it gives them and their toddlers immense comfort and closeness.The World Health Organisation recommends that breastfeeding should continue for up to two years of age and beyond, with appropriate complementary foods from six months. So alongside introducing solid foods and a cup from about six months you can continue to breastfeed avoiding any need to give bottles or infant formula.Partial weaningPartial weaning may be an option if you are feeling overwhelmed by your child’s need to breastfeed round the clock. Shortening the length of feeds or reducing their frequency may be enough to make you feel less overwhelmed. Some families ﬁnd weaning their little one from night-feeds relieves the pressure—other families encourage their child to feed less during the day whilst meeting his need to nurse at night. You may have become used to thinking that nursing meets your baby’s every need for attention. As a child grows he will crave your focused attention as well as your presence. Just joining in enthusiastically with his play may be enough to change the pattern.Natural weaningOne thing is certain: all children eventually stop breastfeeding. They grow and change dramatically in the ﬁrst few years of life, and their interest in nursing changes too. Children want to nurse only as long as it fulﬁls a need for them. A need that is satisﬁed goes away. Many mothers just continue to enjoy the closeness and connection of breastfeeding for as long as it is working well for them. Natural weaning allows their children to grow at their own pace, giving up breastfeeding according to their own timetable. This gradual process allows a mother’s milk to diminish slowly and comfortably.Returning to workBreastfeeding can continue if you are returning to work. Some mothers express milk while at work for their baby to have next day—others simply continue nursing while at home. If you decide to wean before you return to work, ﬁrst cut out those feeds that happen during working hours. If things don’t go to plan and your child is still nursing once or twice a day when you return to work, breastfeeds will then be at times when you are available. Continuing to enjoy the closeness of nursing can make the periods of separation easier for both of you. It also means your child still gets antibodies through your milk for protection from any infections caught at nursery or when with the childminder.Mixed feelingsIt seems no sooner have you started breastfeeding than people will ask when you intend to stop! Coping with pressure to wean from circumstances outside your control or from outsiders is noteasy. However you will know in your heart what feels right for both of you and the decision is yours alone. You can continue to breastfeed for as long as you are both happy and enjoying breastfeeds. Take weaning as slowly as you wish. All mothers and babies are different. Children mature at varying rates and will wean at different ages. There are no rules on when is the ‘right’ time to ﬁnish breastfeeding— aim to ﬁnish when both you and your child feel good about it.PregnancyPregnant nursing mothers sometimes receive conﬂicting advice about whether to wean. Some continue to breastfeed during pregnancy and may go on to feed both children. This is called tandem nursing. Others wean or ﬁnd their child weans naturally during the pregnancy. The booklet Breastfeeding Through Pregnancy and Beyond or the bookAdventures in Tandem Nursing(2nd edition available through theLLLGB shop). may help when considering your options. Some mothers ﬁnd that shortening feeds or partial weaning helps them meet both their needs and those of their older baby or toddler.Love and attentionWeaning will not remove your child’s need for you or necessarily make you less tired. Nor will weaning from night feeds guarantee that your child will sleep from dusk till dawn. Older babies andtoddlers still wake for a number of reasons—hunger, thirst, discomfort, pain, bad dreams or teething. Your child will need your attention and care for years yet. Providing other kinds of attention can sometimes be more tiring than simply nursing! Ending breastfeeding before your baby or toddler is ready to stop involves effort on your part. You’ll need to offer substitutes and distractions in the form of food and attention. Substituting lots of this ‘other-mothering’ can help your child come through the weaning process with his conﬁdence and trust in you intact. If you are tired or overwhelmed, taking things slowly may be easier for both of youOlder babies and toddlersYou are in the best position to know what sorts of attention will be the most acceptable substitute for nursing for your child. It can take a little trial and error to work out the best options for your child and some may work better than others at different times of the day.Don’t offer, don’t refuseis a simple technique to help when weaning from the breast.Change daily routinesso your child is not reminded about nursing—avoid sitting in your usual nursing chair; get up promptly for breakfast; introduce a bed-time routine that includes a sleepcue, such as a music CD or story which can continue when breastfeeding has stopped.Enlist your partner’s help or that of another adultin giving your child breakfast or settling him to sleep.Offer a snackjust before you expect your child to nurse, so as to increase the length of time between feeds and/or shorten a feed. Sit together and have a drink and a snack yourself. This can emphasise the pleasure of sharing food and is a way of giving attention to compensate for the closeness of breastfeeding.Suggest an interesting activityto distract a child from nursing: visit the park or a friend; cook together; involve him in helping you with your work. Give your child your full attention and save phone calls, emails and your own activities for later.Stay at home and keep things calmto help a child who asks to nurse when he is overwhelmed.Postponementcan be an effective weaning method for helping wean older children who can cope with waiting, but note that it can make some children all the more determined to nurse.Shorter feedsmay work for older children and can be combined with substitution and distraction. You could follow a short nursing with a snack and drink. Some mothers count or sing a nursery rhyme to limit the length of a feed.Bottles or cupsWhether you choose to use a bottle, an open cup or a spouted beaker to replace breastfeeds will depend on your individual circumstances. Introduce bottles only if your baby seems to need thecomfort of sucking from one. An older baby or toddler may like to drink from an open cup so that bottles are unnecessary. Unmodiﬁed cows’ milk is unsuitable as a main drink for babies under a year old so if you decide to stop breastfeeding before 12 months ask your health visitor what to give instead of breastmilk. A baby tends to drink larger amounts at each feed from a bottle than from the breast so he may need fewer bottles per day than his usual number of breastfeeds. He’ll miss the close contact and comfort that nursing provides so double up on cuddling and carrying to make up for it.How quickly?Building plenty of time into your weaning strategy will allow you to try different approaches and decide what works best for you both. It will enable you to slow down the pace if your baby is ill or teething, or when life is hectic. For your own comfort the younger your baby the slower you may need to wean.If you are actively working towards stopping breastfeeding, cut out one feed per day, no more often than every two or three days. This will allow your milk production to decrease slowly avoiding uncomfortable fullness and reducing your risk of becoming engorged or developing mastitis.If your breasts feel uncomfortably full or painful, take action to relieve engorgement—it’s easiest to just breastfeed. Even a short feed or hand expressing a small amount of milk can make a difference. SeeEngorged Breasts—avoiding and treatingfor more suggestions. By keeping the process ﬂexible and taking things at a steady pace you’ll stay comfortable and your child can gradually become accustomed to substitutes for breastfeeding, for comfort sucking and at sleep-times.Naptime and sleepNaptime and bedtimebreastfeeds are often the last to go and can seem the hardest to end, because they are often a cue for sleep. Some mothers continue with these, even when daytime weaning is complete. La Leche League does not advocate sleep-training techniques in which babies or children are left to cry for long periods. These methods for training young babies to fall asleep alone can be distressing for all involved and may be psychologically damaging. A well-attached child likes to know someone who loves him is close by when he goes to sleep. Develop a simple bedtime routine so your little one knows what to expect. At ﬁrst it can include nursing—later you can substitute other sleep cues such as a back rub, songs, stories and kisses. Children love bedtime ritual and it helps to keep the routine consistent by using the same sequence of cues whenever you settle your young child to sleep—day and night. Adults, too, like bedtime routines!Ideas for night weaning• A bedtime story and cuddle with a drink and snack can replace the closeness of breastfeeding.• Once your child is sleepy, he may be able to fall asleep with a cuddle, or while you are gently patting or stroking his back. This way you can help him learn to fall asleep without your nipple in hismouth. You may need to be gently persistent.• Cuddles in another pair of loving arms can replace nursing at night, if you have another supportive adult available.• Offer a drink and possibly a midnight snack if he wakes and seems thirsty or hungry. Leave a drink and a snack ready for early risers.• Delaying or shortening feeds in the night works for some families. If you ﬁnd your child is insistent on nursing why not just nurse him brieﬂy—until he settles? Or offer other comforting until a certain time, say 3 am, then breastfeed as needed after that to ensure that everyone gets some rest.• An older toddler may be able to make an agreement with you not to ask to nurse until it is light outside.Babies and toddlers often go back to sleep more easily if they receive attention before they are fully awake. Sleeping close by your toddler may make night waking less of an issue as you can lie down and rest while he settles. Alternatively, some families ﬁnd their little ones are reminded less of nursing if mum and the breast aren’t too easily available.Time and patienceSometimes new habits are very quickly established, at other times this takes longer, but being aware of your child’s feelings and meeting his needs should help weaning go smoothly and pleasantly for you both. Going at your child’s pace helps prevent this becoming a battle.Take a breakIf weaning isn’t going well—perhaps because your baby isn’t developmentally ready, or because he is teething or unwell—you may ﬁnd that having a break from it for a few days, or even a week or so makes a difference. Taking this time to recharge gives you more energy to continue. A week can make a lot of difference to a baby’s development and weaning may subsequently become easier. Babies and children need more emotional security at times of developmental change. Stepping back like this takes courage, but it can give you time to consider how to end breastfeeding in a way which suits you both. What may initially seem impossible could soon alter dramatically because babies constantly grow and change. The longer you can allow for your child to adjust to weaning, the easier it will be for him.Looking after yourselfIf you can, reduce unnecessary outside commitments and limit activity to essentials if you are trying to stop breastfeeding. You can then give your child the focused attention he will need and also have time to rest or sleep during the day. A break or rest can be just as important for you as your baby grows as when he was a newborn— particularly if he is very active.Could you…• Lie down with your baby to sleep in the day? Sometimes extra closeness helps with weaning.• Use outside help if there is someone your toddler feels comfortable spending time with?• Arrange a quiet time, with quiet activities in a safe room? You may be able to cuddle while you rest, even if you cannot sleep. Even when an older child no longer sleeps during the day, maintaining the ritual of a ‘quiet time’ after lunch or a rest for both of you helps pace the day.• Go for a walk with your child in the buggy, or for a drive in the car? If he is lulled by the movement and the view, you then have time to recharge your mental batteries.• Get to bed a little earlier so as to have a longer period of uninterrupted sleep?When a child isn’t ready to weanIt isn’t easy when you are ready to stop and your baby is not. Breastfeeding can easily become a struggle and you can end up feeling frustrated and resentful. A baby’s fussiness or demands for attention usually increase, at least temporarily, when a major change such as weaning takes place. Your child’s behaviour will let you know if weaning is moving too quickly. Increased tantrums, crying, regressive behaviours, anxiety, thumb sucking, increased night waking, new fears of separation and clinginess are possible signs that weaning is moving too fast for your child. If your child is so desperate to nurse that you can’t distract or comfort him, slow down or change your weaning tactics to ones that suit him better, or perhaps wait a while before trying again. Children over two years old may be more ﬂexible and open to negotiation about their need to nurse so weaning may often be accomplished more easily by waiting until this point.An increased need for closenessAs your child weans he will have a continued, perhaps even stronger, need for closeness with you. In fact, some mothers have success with weaning older children by offering to nurse at every opportunity. Once a child realises his mother is willing to let him breastfeed whenever he wants, he may simply abandon the need. Plan plenty of ’special time’ with your child. Meeting his general need for closeness may help him feel more secure, so reducing his need for nursing.Comments from othersYour biggest challenge may be coping with opinions of others on how long you should continue tobreastfeed and how weaning should happen.Because of this you may start feeling uncomfortable about nursing your older toddler in front of others. Some mothers set limits on where and when they nurse, or offer distractions at times when it’s inconvenient. Selecting your clothing carefully can help avoid accidental overexposure and choosing a codeword for breastfeeding such as ’num-nums’ makes it less obvious when your child asks to nurse when out and about.Finding supportThe decision to wean is a very personal one. Your feelings about nursing are important—more important than any advice from others. Many new mothers cannot envisage nursing a baby beyondsix months, let alone a year. But perceptions often change as the breastfeeding relationship grows and develops, and many a mother nurses her baby for longer than initially intended. A La Leche League Leader will always be willing to help you tailor weaning to suit your needs and those of your child, so that your progress towards total weaning becomes more enjoyable.

"Contact (custody) cases are often a balancing act.  An English or Welsh Court will primarily have regard to the overriding objective in all England and Wales family law cases, which is: “what is in the best interests of the child”. This includes consideration of a list of factors including the baby or child’s physical, emotional and psychological health. Some guidelines in Scotland may differ.The Court will consider the wishes of both parents to have contact with their child, alongside what is appropriate for that infant at that time.  When a child in a contact case is breastfed it can add another layer of fact and wellbeing into the mix. Breastfeeding is an intense and enormously important part of a mother-child relationship and it can be very distressing to be told that it may have to be compromised to fit in with contact with the other parent.While LLLGB cannot offer legal advice, we can offer support with any breastfeeding difficulties and provide information which may be helpful. SeeFurther Readingfor some useful links.What is taken into account?Separation studyAttachment theoryThe human right to breastfeedPossible negotiationThe health significance of breastfeedingArguing against breastfeedingWill breastfeeding have to end?How LLL can helpWhat is taken into account?The Judge will determine what contact is considered is in the best interests of a child, and the decision is governed by criteria set out in various acts of Parliament.  Breastfeeding may be taken into account if the child is under one, although sometimes formula has been considered an acceptable alternative.Some Judges and court officers (such as CAFCASS officers or Guardians) are not fully informed about the physical, emotional and health significance of breastfeeding, as well as about the differences between breastmilk and formula.Each Judge will make a unique decision on the individual circumstances of the child or children in that case. In some cases some mothers have been able to successfully negotiate delayed overnight access for their child.  Providing research to show why overnight access could be distressing may help.Separation studyA Study which may be helpful was done by US researchers at the University of Virginia, July 2013. The researchers set out to discover what happens when babies under 12 months old spend a night or more per week away from their mothers, as increasingly happens when separated parents share custody.They found that such infants had more insecure attachments to their mothers compared with babies who had fewer overnight stays or saw their fathers only during the day.Lead author Samantha Tornello, a PhD psychology student at the University, said attachments during the critical first year serve as the basis for healthy relationships in adulthood.  She was reported as saying “Judges often find themselves making decisions regarding custody without knowing what actually may be in the best interest of the child, based on psychology research.’(The findings were published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, based on data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study of about 5,000 children born in US cities from 1998 to 2000. Parents were interviewed several times and children were assessed at ages one and three.)Attachment TheoryMany well-respected psychologists and scientists have written about Attachment Theory. This Theory was developed in the 1960s by British psychologist John Bowlby (http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesal/p/john-bowlby.htm). He showed that babies need a primary care figure to form an attachment to and that this is important for emotional security.  For a young child this often means they need to be with their mother and to be able to breastfeed for comfort as well as nutrition. More recently both Dr Margot Sunderland (Director of Education and Training at the Centre of Child Mental Health Londonhttp://www.margotsunderland.org/) and Sue Gerhardt  have written about this.   Providing information about Attachment Theory may be helpful.The human right to breastfeedA legal provision which might be worth emphasising is Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which describes the right to respect for an individual’s private and family life. A baby, like all human beings, has a right to “physical and moral integrity” (covered under the concept of private life, according to the European Court of Human Rights), which might include the continuing physical and emotional significance of breastfeeding. It is possible that a disproportionate interruption/disruption of nursing and/or time with mother could arguably be a breach of that right.Possible negotiationThe first step in any case would be to try to negotiate with your partner a contact arrangement which takes account of the breastfeeding relationship.  A mother may be able to negotiate a shared parenting plan that takes into account breastfeeding, with the understanding that it would be flexible as the child grows. A solicitor can make any agreement a legal document.If you can’t negotiate it’s really important to get a solicitor you feel will listen to you and who understands the importance of breastfeeding. It may be assumed that a woman may be more sympathetic than a man but this is not necessarily the case. It is absolutely fine to take initial advice from more than one solicitor, until you find the person who represents your views and position in the best possible way for you.  Solicitors will often offer a free initial consultation so that you might decide this.Where the breastfeeding relationship is a mother’s priority it may be necessary to compromise on other issues. Unfortunately, making breastfeeding the sole issue can sometimes be counter-productive. Dividing up issues and dealing with one at time may help.   Keeping calm may be difficult but getting angry can hinder negotiations.The health significance of breastfeedingNot breastfeeding results in increased health risks to both mother and child, both short-term and long-term, physical and emotional.  It can be helpful to have a knowledgeable paediatrician speak up about why breastfeeding is of such importance.  There is a lot of helpful information on the internet which can be useful to give to a lawyer to give them a better view of why you parent as you do.Here is a list of some things which may be helpful in demonstrating the importance of breastfeeding.The difference between breastmilk and formulaBreastmilk contains living cells, hormones, active enzymes, antibodies and compounds with unique structures that can never be replicated in formula. It adapts to suit our own baby. Cows’ milk is designed to help calves grow fast and put on lots of muscle. Breast milk contains lots of omega-3 essential fats, which are known to have an important role in the development and function of the brain, along with gradual physical growth.The composition of human milk changes to meet the changing needs of baby as he matures, and even from feed to feed. Even when baby is able to take solids, human milk is the best source of nutrition during the first year.  It becomes a supplement to solids during the second year but keeps nutritional value, as well as emotional benefits.The significance to the immune systemIt takes between two and six years for a child’s immune system to fully mature. Human milk continues to complement and boost the immune system for as long as offered, helping the baby remain healthy and fight germs to which either the mother or baby have been exposed.The significance to a child’s healthBreastfed babies are less likely to suffer from a range of conditions such as gastroenteritis, chest infections, eczema, asthma, celiac disease, crohn’s disease, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, ear infections, diabetes in childhood, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood obesity, urinary tract infections and childhood leukaemia and other cancers.  Just 2 months of exclusive breastfeeding helps lower the risk and/or severity of allergies. There is a lower risk of urinary tract infections after 5 months.There is evidence that the longer a baby is breastfed the greater the protection from ill health and the more positive impact on their long-term health.  A breastfed baby is five times less likely to be hospitalised with gastroenteritis and on average will visit the doctor 15% less in the first six months.The effect on a mother’s healthBreastfeeding also reduces a mother’s risk of developing breast, ovarian, cervical and uterine cancer.  It protects a mother against developing osteoporosis, with a reduced risk of postnatal depression, and helps the woman’s uterus to return to normal size after giving birth and helps to lose weight.  There is a lower risk of diabetes type 2 among women who breastfeed.The effect on emotional healthA breastfed baby may become very distressed if separated from their mother, and intense, extended crying causes cortisol (stress) levels to rise, which can lead to long-term problems. The gastrointestinal hormone, cholecystokinine (CCK) hormone helps both mother and baby to relax and sleep. Breastfeeding has been shown to lower blood pressure and this effect is ongoing.Breastmilk is not just about getting food into a baby, it is part of the mothering relationship. It is the natural way to be close to a baby and helps with bonding. Recent studies have shown a reduced risk of maternal neglect amongst breastfeeding mothers. The mothering hormones prolactin and oxytocin help a mother care for her baby by lowering her blood pressure and helping her to relax physically.Arguing against breastfeedingMothers sometimes have to contend with the suggestion that they are continuing to breastfeeding to fill their own needs and to control their child.  It may be suggested that there are no benefits for the child. It’s possible that in making breastfeeding the main issue a judge could view this as an attempt to interfere with the rights of the other parent.  It is sometimes claimed that the breastfeeding relationship can or should be curtailed, with the mother being portrayed as leading an alternative lifestyle which is affecting her child; or as being overly attached to her child.Katherine Dettwyler, PH.D., Department of Anthropology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, has written an open letter to be used in court cases which clearly sets out the biological norm of breastfeeding. You can read ithere.It may be possible to turn this argument around and ask the other partner to provide evidence which shows good reason why breastfeeding is not beneficial.Will breastfeeding have to end?When a breastfed child has contact time with her other parent it doesn’t mean breastfeeding has to end.  Depending on the child’s age a mother may be able to talk to her about the situation and help her to cope with a new routine, if it comes to it.  If a mother can be positive about the change and present it as an “adventure” where the child will be doing things with the other parent it can help to ease the transition.Children are surprisingly adaptable in their nursing habits.   Even young babies whose mothers go back to work and leave them for many hours have been seen to adapt so that they sleep and do not feed much while mum is away, but make up for it when she comes home.Some women have told us that they have gone away for a few days and their older breastfed child has been perfectly happy while they are away, but has returned to the breast when they returned.   Sometimes a mother has suddenly had to be separated due to family illness or going into hospital and an older child can understand this.  They can have an ability to understand when mum is not there to nurse them and a different routine with the other partner.It may help to explain that when she gets home you will be there waiting with (her name for nursing).  Some children will need to nurse a lot more for a while although others may need gentle encouragement to continue nursing. Although this is not ideal it will hopefully make it possible to continue your nursing relationship.How LLL can helpLLLGB Leaders can support the breastfeeding relationship and offer practical information, including information on pumping, avoiding engorgement and mastitis.  We understand that this will be an emotional time and even one of grieving for the loss of the breastfeeding relationship the mother had hoped for. The lovely, secure emotional bond mothers give their children through the breastfeeding relationship is something which will always stay with them. While any separation will not be easy, with some compromises it should be possible for this to continue as long as you both want.Written by Anna Burbidge and Johanna Rhys-Davies.Further ReadingStill nursingBreastfeeding beyond a yearNursing StrikesWhen breastfeeding ends suddenlyUseful linksWHO infant feeding recommendationKaterine Dettwyler’s open letter for use in court casesBreastfeeding Past Infancy: Fact SheetAttachment Parenting International resources on divorce, custody & blended familiesLancet research on long-term benefits to breastfeedingWhy Love Matters: How Affection Shapes a Baby’s Brain by Sue Gerhardt, Routledge, London, 2004.What Every Parent Needs to Know: The incredible effects of love, nurture and play on your child’s development by Margot Sunderland, DK, 2007.A Secure Base by John Bowlby, Basic Books, reprint edition 1990.Copyright LLLGB 2016",https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-contact-cases/,Breastfeeding & contact cases
"Early daysPublic placePlanning aheadA flexible approachTime for social activityTravelling with your babyEarly daysAfter giving birth to your baby, you may prefer to be close to home. Rest, along with frequent will help you regain your strength and build up a good milk supply while getting to know your baby. When you feel ready to go out, a short walk or drive to your local shops or to visit a friend or relative may be enough.Going out can prevent you from feeling isolated and give structure to your day. Breastfed babies are very portable—with your baby in a sling or carrier, you may only need a nappy or two and away you go. Babies will often sleep contentedly when carried close to their mothers, so you may even get there and back while your baby is asleep.Public placesMothers often worry about breastfeeding in public spaces such as shops and cafés. But the law protects you when you breastfeed in a public place and on premises. It is against the law to discriminate against a breastfeeding mother throughout the UK, although protection varies slightly depending on location.In England and WalesA woman cannot be prosecuted for breastfeeding under public decency laws. A mother can ignore people who ask her to stop feeding and she can just carry on. Unfortunately though, she has no specific legal protection against their actual comments objecting to breastfeeding. If, however, the remarks become aggressive or abusive then women have a right to report this as with any other form of abuse.In ScotlandUnder Scottish legislation, it is an offence to deliberately prevent or stop a woman from breastfeeding in a public place. If a mother is approached by anyone, anywhere, and asked to stop breastfeeding, she has the right to phone the police who will attend, discuss with the person involved, and warn them that they are committing an offence liable to a fine of up to £2,500.In Northern IrelandBreastfeeding mothers are protected by sex discrimination laws that prohibit anyone from treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding and the Government intends to introduce specific legislation to support and protect breastfeeding infants and their mothers in public places.Planning aheadA crying baby will guarantee an audience so watch for early feeding cues so you have time to find a suitable place. Other people probably won’t notice you’re breastfeeding if you’re relaxed and confident—especially if you continue chatting or reading the menu and avoid eye contact with passers-by.If you prefer to keep covered then lifting your top from the waist means your baby hides your tummy and you remain covered on top. Layering can help – depending on the weather try an open blouse, shirt or cardigan over a t-shirt. A breastfeeding vest can cover your tummy. Some baby slings and carriers can also hide a feeding baby and a baby sun hat can work well too. If you feel self-conscious, try practising in front of your partner, a friend or a mirror.With time, you’ll learn what you’re likely to need while out with your baby. Include nappies, baby wipes and a change of baby clothes. It’s also worth taking a favourite toy for older babies. Don’t forget a bottle of water for yourself— breastfeeding can make you thirsty. A baby sling or carrier can be easier than a pram or buggy where there are steps or uneven surfaces. It also keeps your baby close. If you have shopping to carry, a pushchair can be helpful—you can still take a sling to carry your baby if they get restless!Handling leaksIf you leak milk between feeds you can use breast pads inside your bra to provide protection. Some breast pads made of silicon, use gentle pressure to completely prevent leaking. If you feel the tingling of your milk beginning to flow, pressing hard on your nipples for several seconds can prevent leaking. You can do this by crossing your arms tightly across your chest and pressing firmly on your nipples with the palms of your hands. Hold for a few seconds before releasing and all should be well. If it doesn’t work first time, try again for a little longer. If your breasts feel full, this is a sign to take the time to nurse your baby. Patterned fabrics, layered clothing and scarves can all hide evidence of leaks.Where to breastfeedMothers breastfeed in many public places with seating areas: shopping, leisure and visitor centres, libraries, museums and more. Look out for quiet spots with fewer distractions as some babies insist on looking around instead of feeding when there’s a lot of hustle and bustle! A town garden or park may be an option when the weather is good. Or visit a café or the family room of a pub. You can also breastfeed while walking with your baby in a sling.If you prefer privacy, many public places have mother and baby rooms where you can sit to nurse and change your baby’s nappy. Some clothes shops will make a changing room available to a nursing mother at quiet times.A flexible approachRather than thinking of nursing as a major event around which to structure the day, it can help to treat it as you would a coffee break—something that happens along with the other events of the day. If you nurse your baby at fixed intervals, they may need to nurse for an hour or more to take sufficient milk. It can be hard to get out and about with a baby who is feeding for long periods of time. While a baby nursing little and often is more likely to need to breastfeed while you are out, it can be easier to fit in shorter nursing sessions. Many babies become very efficient at breastfeeding by the age of three months and feeds can be accomplished very quickly.Keeping some flexibility in feeding and sleeping rhythms can also make life easier when travelling, on holiday, visiting family etc as strict routines can be difficult to follow in those situations. When you follow your baby’s natural feeding and sleeping rhythms such problems are less likely and you may feel more relaxed about visiting relatives or taking a family holiday.Time for social activityBreastfeeding becomes much easier when you spend time with others who are breastfeeding. Local LLL groups are a good starting point—offering mother-to-mother support and the chance to socialise. You’ll also be able to see how other mothers handle breastfeeding in a public place, and gather ideas. You may well develop good friendships to support you in your new mothering role.Travelling with your babyBreastmilk is the ultimate travel food. There’s no need to carry any feeding equipment and your baby’s favourite food will always be on hand, even if your journey is delayed.Public transportWhen hopping on and off buses and trains a carrier or sling is a real boon, with or without a pushchair.If you take a pushchair, modern train doors are usually wide enough and many buses have low floors for easy access.A backpack can be a useful handbag, leaving your hands free for your baby.In the carPlan to stop frequently and give your baby breaks from their car seat. It can help to time long journeys for when they usually sleep. Avoid rush hour if you can.Place your car seat where you can safely see your baby as you drive. An extra mirror can be useful if your baby travels in the back.Bear in mind that if your baby gets upset this can distract you while driving. Letting someone else drive when possible leaves you free to calm your baby.Babies are usually happier in the car if they can see you or another adult. You could talk or sing to your baby to reassure them you are there. If your baby doesn’t like the car it may be easier to take public transport so you can hold and nurse them as you travel.FlyingA sling or soft carrier can be really convenient at the airport. It can also give you privacy as you nurse during the flight.It can be useful to request a bulkhead seat to give you more space. Alternatively having an aisle seat allows you to get up easily if your baby is restless without disturbing other passengers.Take a few of your baby’s favourite toys and, if possible, familiar snacks if they have started eating solid food.Breastfeeding during take off and landing can help equalize the pressure in your baby’s ears, keeping them comfortable. However, to comply with seat belt regulations you may need to nurse in an unusual position. If seat belts make breastfeeding too awkward, offering your baby a finger or suitable toy to suck on may do the trick. When the seat belt light goes out, you can nurse them as normal.There are specific airline regulations for carrying expressed breastmilk in flight hand luggage.

"Breastmilk has everything a growing baby needs in exactly the right amounts and is easy to digest. Research shows that a baby who is not breastfed is more likely to suffer from health problems, both as a child and throughout adulthood.Can anyone breastfeed?Breastfeeding is the normal, natural way to feed and care for a baby and babies are born expecting to breastfeed. Women all over the world, regardless of their diet, produce the right type and amount of milk to nourish their growing babies, whether it’s one or more!Women who are not able to exclusively breastfeed can choose to partially breastfeed, using supplements as needed so their baby still benefits from breastmilk. For those facing breastfeeding challenges,skilled help is available from LLL Leaders.Breastmilk contains:Stem cellswhich are used by the baby. Stem cells create and repair the body, and they are a key part of treatments for many illnesses and diseases. [1]Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)– sugars which are indigestible to the baby but feed friendly bacteria lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (among others). These are crucial to the development of a healthy gut microbiome, which kickstarts the immune system, promotes good digestion, and reduces the growth of unfriendly bacteria. An imbalanced microbiome could affect lifetime health and increase the risk of all non-infectious diseases. [2]Antibodieswhich are specifically tailored to bacteria and viruses found in your environment. Just 20 mins after being exposed to an infectious agent a mother is producing the right antibody in her milk. [1, 3]Immune cells, cytokines and antimicrobial factorswhich all help support the baby while his immune system is still developing (approx. 6 yrs). [2]Oxytocin– a hormone which reduces stress and promotes feelings of well-being in mum and baby. [1]Alpha-lactalbumin– a protein with pain relief properties. [1]Extra melatonin at nightwhich helps mum and baby go back to sleep quickly. [4]Healthier for lifeStudies show your baby will be healthier throughout their life if they are breastfed. Infant formula increases a child’s risk of:SIDS, Cancer, Obesity, Diabetes, and Allergies. [5]In addition to an increased risk of:Asthma, Autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis and coeliac disease, Cardiovascular disease, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, Dental caries, Diarrhoea, Ear infections, Epilepsy, Gastroenteritis, High blood pressure and high cholesterol, Hypersensitivity and inflammation, Liver disease, Mental health issues, Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), Respiratory infections including bronchiolitis, and Urinary tract infections. [5, 6]Babies have tiny tummies and breastmilk is digested quickly so a newborn baby breastfeeds at least 8–12 times in a 24 hour period. The first time a newborn baby feeds he only takes about a teaspoon of milk (colostrum) but this provides his first immunity boost and lines and protects his intestines.Infant Formula:Is a breastmilk substituteInfant formula is a highly processed food: a base of cow’s milk, goat’s milk or soy, with vegetable oils and other additives. Breastmilk is a complete and perfect food for your baby – nature has been refining your breastmilk for hundreds of millions of years. [1]Can never accurately replicate human milkBreastmilk is a living tissue, just like blood. It changes throughout feeds and from feed to feed to match your baby’s needs. We can’t accurately synthesise artificial breastmilk. Many breastmilk components have unique structures that can’t be made in a factory.Cow’s milk for calves, breastmilk for human babiesCow’s milk is designed to help calves grow fast and put on lots of muscle.

Bottle feeding produces pollution and waste disposal problems due to the manufacture, packaging, transport and preparation of the formula and bottles.Position is importantGetting a baby positioned and latched on comfortably at the breastis the key to enjoyable feeds and making enough milk. Breastfeeding is normal and natural, but it’s an art that can take both mum and baby a bit of time and practice to learn. One of the best ways to find out about breastfeeding is to watch and learn from other breastfeeding mothers.You can breastfeed anywhereBabies often want to breastfeed when people around them are eating and drinking – and why not? Breastfeeding mothers are protected under UK equality law. Some women may feel unsure about breastfeeding in front of others initially, but soon become more confident. If you wish, it’s very easy to be discreet while breastfeeding – there are lots of clothes designed especially for breastfeeding.Breastfeeding doesn’t ruin your figureA woman’s body changes naturally during pregnancy.

"Breastfeeding is the normal and natural way to feed and nurture a baby. If you have diabetes you may be concerned about whether you can breastfeed. The answer is yes.All mothers experience metabolic and hormonal changes after giving birth. A mother with diabetes who breastfeeds has an advantage as breastfeeding reduces the impact of these changes. When you breastfeed, your body continues to support you and your baby, making your diabetes easier to manage in the days after birth. Later on, gradual weaning helps you to maintain control of your diabetes.Gestational diabetesBenefits of breastfeedingWhat about medications?Be preparedBlood glucose controlLarger babyBabies can have a hypo after birthAntenatal expression of colostrumGet breastfeeding off to a good startLooking after yourselfAdjusting your dietGestational diabetesIt can be a shock if you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes during your pregnancy. This is usually a temporary condition in which your body fails to produce enough insulin to meet your extra needs while you are pregnant. It is usually diagnosed from the fourth month of pregnancy. Just like mothers who are on long-term treatment for diabetes, good control of blood glucose levels will minimise any problems for you and your baby. You may not need any extra medical care during labour and delivery. Diabetes treatment is usually unnecessary once you have given birth.Benefits of breastfeedingFor you (as a diabetic mother)Breastfeeding increases your insulin sensitivity and has long term positive effects on your glucose metabolism.• For Type-1 diabetes, breastfeeding will reduce the amount of insulin you need.• For Type-2 diabetes, breastfeeding will reduce the severity of your diabetes.• For Gestational diabetes, breastfeeding significantly reduces your risk of developing diabetes later in life.Breastfeeding suppresses your periods and monthly hormonal changes.See our pageAmazing milkfor more information.For your babyStudies show that your baby will behealthier throughout their lifeif they are breastfed. Infant formula increases a baby’s chance of developing diabetes.What about medicationsInsulin treatment is compatible with breastfeeding. Insulin molecules are too large to pass into your milk. Check with your doctor for up-to-date information on any other medications you take. If there is any concern over safety, an LLL Leader can obtain information on named medications for you.Be preparedHaving diabetes can increase the risk of the following problems which may impact breasfeeding:• Premature birth•Caesarean birth• Newborn hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)•Newborn jaundice.See Further reading at the end of the page for a selection of resources to help avoid these problems and overcome difficulties. You may also like to find out about your local hospital’s policies on the management of these and care of diabetic mothers during and after pregnancy.Do ask if the hospital has an Infant Feeding Advisor who will be well informed about breastfeeding and a source of support in those early days.Blood glucose controlThis is the key to avoiding problems in pregnancy, labour and after birth.If you are planning a pregnancy, practise good diabetes management before you conceive too.• Frequent antenatal and diabetes medical care will allow you to address any problems quickly.• Discuss with the doctors, nurses and dieticians in your diabetes team how to control your changing needs for insulin, other medication and food while pregnant and after birth.• You may be given a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) which will notify you if your blood glucose levels get too high or too low.• Monitor your blood glucose levels closely, so you can adjust your insulin, other medication and food intake.You may need to eat frequent smaller meals a day to avoid hypos (hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose levels) and peaks in blood glucose levels.Larger babyEven with excellent control, diabetic mothers tend to have larger than average babies. Good blood glucose control will help limit how large your baby grows, making birth easier and reducing the risk of complications.Babies can have a hypo after birthYour baby will be prone to hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels) during the first 12 hours after birth, particularly if you have poor blood glucose control in pregnancy. Even with good control, your baby will have been used to relatively high levels of glucose before he was born. The extra insulin he produces can lead to a drop in blood glucose after birth. Skin-to-skin contact, and early frequent breastfeeding will help avoid problems.Check your hospital’s policy for testing blood glucose levels and treating a baby’s hypo. Your colostrum (first milk) is the best food for your baby if he has a hypo. If your baby has not breastfed yet, stored colostrum can be given.Antenatal expression of colostrumIn the last few weeks of pregnancy you can express some colostrum (early milk). This can be given to your baby if he can’t breastfeed after birth, or he needs supplements for any reason eg hypoglycaemia. Our information sheetAntenatal Expression of Colostrumexplains how to do this before birth so you have some of your milk immediately available for your baby should he need any supplement.Get breastfeeding off to a good startThe first few daysFor many mothers with diabetes, milk production increases later than for mothers who don’t have diabetes. You can help your milk production increase normally on the third or fourth day with good control of blood glucose. Fluctuations in insulin levels will affect milk production, and increase the risk of your baby needing supplements.Get skilled breastfeeding help sooner rather than later to reduce the need for supplements.Your baby will need to stay in hospital for at least 24 hours after birth, until he is feeding well and maintaining blood glucose levels.Breastfeeding basics• Hold your baby against your skin after birth so he can breastfeed as soon as possible, ideally within the first hour after birth.• Keep your baby with you unless separation is medically necessary.• Try to breastfeed every hour for the first several hours, until your baby’s blood glucose levels stabilise. Ensure your baby feeds at least 8-12 times each 24 hour period.• Spend as much time as you can holding your baby and encouraging him to feed frequently.Separation and supplementsTake action if you and your baby are separated or if your baby needs supplements for any reason.• Hand express small amounts of colostrum frequently to give to your baby. This will also help you establish milk production.• Once you can express larger amounts, you can use a hospital-grade pump.• Your baby can be given your milk with a syringe, cup or spoon.Being separated from your new baby will be hard for you. As soon as you can, spend as much time as possible with him to help make up for lost time. Even visiting him in the neonatal intensive care (NICU) or special care baby unit (SCBU) will help, as you will be able to touch, stroke and talk to him and take over some of his care. You can ask to give him kangaroo mother care, in which a baby is snuggled skin-to-skin against mum’s chest. Kangaroo care helps to stabilise a baby’s heartbeat, temperature and breathing, and encourages breastfeeding. The hormones produced will help you express your milk, even if you can’t breastfeed straight away.Looking after yourselfAfter birthAt first your blood glucose levels can change rapidly and you are at increased risk of having a hypo. Take suitable snacks into hospital so you have something readily available —and watch out for early signs of hypos.Later you’ll have to manage your own health while caring for your baby. Keep suitable snacks and drinks within arms reach in all the places you are likely to breastfeed your baby to treat hypos at the first signs.Seek skilled help straight away if you experience sore nipples or breasts, to reduce the risk of an infection. You are more at risk from a thrush infection of the nipple area if you have diabetes.Rest when you canLack of sleep can make it harder to manage your diabetes and be a cause of stress, which means youor blood glucose levels will run higher. Try to rest when your baby sleeps and accept offers of practical help from others when you need to.Adjusting your dietBreastfeeding helps your body adjust gradually to the metabolic and hormonal changes all mothers experience after birth.You may need to eat many more extra calories a day while breastfeeding, eating regularly to maintain blood sugar levels. This will allow you to use your fat stores without the risk of ketones in your blood and urine.Further supportYourlocal LLL Leader and Groupcan be a source of information and support. You may also find it helpful to meet with other mothers at your local LLL group. You will be able to share practical tips on breastfeeding and mothering and find out what is normal for a breastfed baby.Written by Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGBFurther ReadingPositioning & attachmentPositioning & Attachment(Kindle publication)Antenatal Expression of ColostrumBirth & BreastfeedingBeginning BreastfeedingCaesarean Birth & BreastfeedingComfortable BreastfeedingHand Expression of BreastmilkIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Jaundice in Healthy NewbornsMy Baby Won’t BreastfeedSleepy Baby – why and what to doThrushSkin-to-skinBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, LLLI.

"Breastfeeding your baby is still the best choice you can make, even if you can’t stop smoking.Breastfeeding provides significant health benefits for mothers and babies. For babies, it reduces their risk of diabetes, certain cancers, respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and many other health problems. For mothers, it protects against breast cancer, helps with postnatal weight loss, and encourages a unique mother-child bond that can’t be duplicated.Breastfeeding is just as beneficial for the smoking mother and her baby as it is for the non-smoking mother and her baby. Research has shown that babies of smokers are at increased risk of colic, respiratory infections, and SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or cot death).But breastfed babies are at lower risk for these diseases compared to artificially fed ones, even when their mothers continue to smoke.And breastfeeding helps to protect babies from the potential risks of cigarette smoke. Breastfeeding and smoking may well be less harmful to the child than bottle feeding and smoking.Cut down on smokingSmoke after breastfeedingMonitor your baby’s weightProtecting your baby against SIDSRelaxationNicotine replacement therapyContinue breastfeedingCut down on smokingFewer cigarettes smoked means less smoke in the air, lower levels of nicotine in your milk, better health for everyone, and more time with your baby. Smoke as far away from your baby as possible To prevent exposing your baby to smoke and particles small enough to inhale, any smoker in your household should smoke outside or at least in another room, away from your baby. Some health professionals suggest that family members who smoke should always wash their hands after smoking and before touching the baby. A smoker can also wear a jacket or other outer garment while smoking to protect clothing from smoke particles. This garment can then be removed before any contact with the baby so that the baby will be exposed to fewer smoke particles.Smoke after breastfeedingWhen a breastfeeding mother smokes, the nicotine levels in her blood and milk rise, and then fall over time. So, smoking straight after breastfeeding minimizes the amount of nicotine in your milk. About 95 minutes after smoking, the level of nicotine in a mother’s blood and milk has fallen by about half. Your baby will probably want to nurse frequently in the early weeks, so you won’t always be able to wait that long between smoking and the next feed. Frequent breastfeeding is good for your milk production and ensures that your baby gets enough to eat. Medications and Mothers’ Milk by Thomas Hale, 2012, states “Mothers should be advised to limit smoking as much as possible and to smoke only after they have fed their infant, or to switch to the use of nicotine patches.”Monitor your baby’s weightSome research suggests that smoking affects a baby’s weight gain, while other research shows no difference between babies of smoking and non-smoking mothers. So, monitor your baby’s weight regularly and talk to anLLL Leaderor your health visitor about any concerns. There are simple ways to increase your milk production.Protecting your baby against SIDSSmoking increases the likelihood of your baby suffering Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death. Sharing a room with your baby for at least the first 6 months helps to protect against SIDS and also helps with night-time breastfeeding. If you or your partner smoke, you should make sure that you never fall asleep with your baby in bed. Your baby’s risk of SIDS is increased if he sleeps in a bed with a smoker. You shouldnever sleep with your baby on a sofa or armchair, whether you are a smoker or not (UNICEF 2011). See our page onSafe Sleep & the Breastfed Baby.RelaxationSmoking is a stress-relieving mechanism for many people. Finding other ways of relaxing can help you cope with nicotine withdrawal:Enjoy cuddling and playing with your baby.Go for a walk, get some fresh air, visit the park and feed the ducks. Take him swimming.Get some rest. Use the relaxation exercises taught in pregnancy. Or have a shower or bath.Read a book or magazine; chat to other mums on social media, findLLLGB Facebook groupsand pages . Crafts like knitting can occupy your hands.Take advantage of non smoking public places to avoid temptation.Meet up with other mothers, including atLLL meetings.Nicotine replacement therapyCommercial products may help you to give up smoking and their use protects your whole family from carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants in the air. It is worth asking a health professional about the most appropriate therapy and dosage to meet your needs. Use nicotine gum, lozenges, microtabs or nasal spray immediately after a breastfeed so that blood levels of nicotine have time to fall before the next feed. This may be 2 to 3 hours for nicotine gum. Nicotine patches provide a steady level of nicotine in your blood and milk. That level can be lower than the level of nicotine when smoking—use a patch with the lowest level of nicotine possible to satisfy your cravings. Remove the patch at night to reduce levels of nicotine during night-time feeds. Research has shown that use of nicotine patches is a safer option than continuing to smoke.Hale 2012 states: “The risk of using nicotine patches while breastfeeding is much less than the risk of formula feeding.” Nicotine inhalers give lower blood levels of nicotine than cigarettes, and levels of nicotine are probably too low to affect a breastfeeding baby (Hale 2012).Electronic cigarettes have not been well studied and are not recommended. NEVER smoke cigarettes when using nicotine replacement products. Smoking while using replacement products may produce dangerous levels of nicotine in your blood and milkContinue breastfeedingThere is no need to stop breastfeeding because you are smoking. Remember that breastfeeding offers your baby protection from the very respiratory diseases you may be worried about.There are plenty of reasons to stop smoking, both for you and your baby. You’ve probably heard about many of them already. Decide what is realistic for you to do, based on your own circumstances. You could stop smoking during pregnancy and while you are breastfeeding. Otherwise try to minimize the effects by smoking away from your baby, allowing as much time as possible between smoking a cigarette and the next breastfeed, and by keeping the number of cigarettes smoked per day as low as possible.Less smoking in your household will be good for your whole family’s health, not just your baby’s. Stop or cut down if you possibly can, but remember that even if you can’t, breastfeeding still provides significant health benefits for both you and your baby. If you would like to discuss this with an LLL Leader you can call ourHelpline. A Leader will also be able to give you information aboutLLL meetingswhere you can chat with other breastfeeding mothers.Adapted by Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGB from an original text by LLLI with thanks to Amy Conway and Kathy Koch, IBCLC for their help with compiling the original information.Inclusion of pictures does not imply that the mothers smoke.Further ReadingAdjusting To MotherhoodIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Rhythms & RoutinesSafe Sleep & the Breastfed BabyBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

"If a woman is summoned for jury service while still breastfeeding it has sometimes proved stressful to get exemption from serving. There can be a lack of understanding and knowledge and an assumption is made that formula can be substituted.  If a simple explanation that a woman is breastfeeding and cannot leave her baby is not accepted then it may be possible to use some of these suggestions.Equality Act 2010Possible risks for mother and babyHuman Rights ActDoctor’s letterEquality Act 2010Under the Equality Act 2010 it is sex discrimination to fail to assess or take action on health and safety risks for a breastfeeding woman where the work could involve risks with serious consequences for mother or baby.It is indirect sex discrimination under the Equality Act for an employer to refuse a flexible working request from a breastfeeding mother if there are not good business reasons for the refusal, and if it results in the mother stopping breastfeeding. This could be applied to being asked to leave a baby.Possible risks for mother and babyRisks for a mother developingengorgementormastitis, a very painful condition, because she will not be able to feed her baby while in court, and there may not be the facilities or time for her to express.It will also be emotionally difficult, and the stress of being separated from her baby, along with discomfort and anxiety may mean it will be hard for her to listen carefully to evidence.  If she feels that the court’s inability to make provision for her health situation will compromise her ability to listen, absorb and assess the evidence then this needs to be made clear.  Not only are the juror’s rights being compromised but the accused has a right to a just and fair trial, which might be affected if the mother is feeling ill.Risks for the baby include the unavailability of breastfeeding to provide nourishment and comfort.  It is often assumed that a baby can just take milk from a bottle but the action of feeding is very different and many cannot adjust.  A baby should not have to have formula against a mother’s wishes, and it takes time to build up an adequate supply of expressed milk. The baby may feel emotional distress being away from his mother.Being separated will also mean that milk supply will drop down with consequences for the future.  It may take time for the mother to increase her supply once more, and lead to distress for her and the baby.Human Rights ActIt may also be possible to object to serving under article 8 Human Rights Act.  This applies to a woman’s rights to physical integrity. She might also argue that it is inhuman and degrading to be preventing from removing milk from her body, particularly is she is also refused the right to pump.  If a mother is told she cannot pump while serving on a jury she might complain to court staff or the judge that article 3 of the Human Rights Act (inhumane and degrading treatment) might be breached.Courts are a public body and, as such, must respect and adhere to the human rights of anyone within the court system. A mother would need to make it clear that she is being put at serious health risk by not being allowed to express breastmilk.For some women simply having court staff who are supportive and pleasant, and being provided with facilities toexpresswould make it possible for them to serve on a jury.Doctor’s letterIt may be possible to ask a doctor to provide a letter stating a woman is breastfeeding and is not eligible for jury service.  It is to be hoped that courts now have a better understanding of breastfeeding and that in future women can decline jury service without being involved in a stressful situation.If you still have concerns about  your summons for jury service you can talk to anLLL Leader.Written by Anna Burbidge.Further ReadingSupporting Women’s Right to BreastfeedThe Breastfeeding DyadCopyright LLLGB 2016",https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-and-jury-servic/,Breastfeeding and Jury Service
"In a world where thinness is sometimes associated with eating disorders and neglect, and obesity with health risks, it’s natural to be concerned about what and how much your child is eating. Mothers often worry that their toddlers don’t eat enough.How toddlers eatToddlers can be remarkably picky eaters, whether or not they still breastfeed. They may refuse to eat foods they have eaten happily in the past or eat everything in sight one day and nothing the next. Sometimes they may seem to eat even less than they did when they were younger. Toddlers can also be unadventurous in their food preferences, opting for familiar favourites.Will they grow?It’s easy to assume that a child who has a limited diet or is not eating much will not grow. But it’s not the case that children grow because they are eating—they eat because they are growing. If food is available and a child is not ill then they will eat until their body tells them they have had enough. This natural appetite control mechanism helps prevent overeating and obesity.How much does he need?Even babies who have taken to solid foods quickly often start to eat less at around 12 months. This can be worrying for parents since we naturally expect our babies to keep eating more as they get bigger. In fact, a child may not need substantially more calories at 12 months or even at two years than he did at six or nine months. This is because his optimal growth rate is normally fastest in the first 12 months. After that, it slows down. If your toddler is still taking plenty of breastmilk he may not need very much extra at all in the way of solid foods.Think in child-sized portionsIt’s easy to forget how small a child’s stomach is, especially when serving pre-packaged foods that come in adult portions such as yoghurt or snacks. Even commercial baby foods come in generous portions. Thinking in child-sized handfuls can help you offer an appropriate portion for his size. A toddler portion could be 1⁄4 of a small banana, 15ml (1 tablespoon) of yoghurt or less than half a slice of bread. If you’re convinced your child really does ‘live on air’ try keeping a note of everything they eat for a week. Include nursing, snacks and drinks and remember to think in ‘toddler portions’. If they really ate nothing they would be obviously losing weight.Measuring growthThe World Health Organization growth charts, based on breastfed babies growing in optimal conditions, are now being adopted in the UK (see Further Reading). Growth charts have been created by combining data from a large sample of healthy babies. The smoothed centile lines don’t represent how an individual baby grows. In reality, growth is uneven and does not continuously follow the chart lines. This is why it’s not helpful to plot weight too often. Genes influence height and weight as well as how the body absorbs and uses food. It doesn’t matter which centile your child’s height and weight are following if they are well and if they continue to grow in height and gain weight over several months. When assessing whether your toddler is thriving consider developmental milestones in addition to weight, height and head circumference. If they have recently had an infection, their growth may have faltered, but it’s likely to catch up soon after recovery. If your child is unwell, their growth pattern is markedly different from the charts, or if they are losing weight, seek advice from your GP.They don’t like it“My child rejects pasta, bread and vegetables but he’ll happily gobble up chocolate cake.” Try not to fall into the trap of offering lots of alternatives just to be sure they have at least eaten something. Most of us can find room for a sweet treat even if we’re not really hungry and this leaves us even less hungry for the next meal! The best way to avoid this happening is to limit puddings and sweet snacks or offer small portions as a nutritious part of the meal—such as fruit crumbles or rice pudding. Simply not buying processed sweet or salty snacks and cakes will improve the whole family’s health.Everyone loves and hates different foods so of course your child will have their own individual preferences. For example, some children prefer dry foods; others love sauces. However, tastes change as time passes, so keep offering new foods in a casual way. The more familiar a food is, the more likely they are to try it. And be aware too that they may adore some foods that you hate!Don’t force them to eatEvery person needs the freedom to choose how much to eat, regardless of age. Nobody wants to be forced to clear the plate as many of us were expected to do as children. It can be tempting to watch your child’s every mouthful and to spoon food in just to satisfy yourself they have eaten what you think they need, but there is little to be gained by making mealtimes a power struggle. Whilst it can sometimes be wise to ask if a child has had enough to eat, never force or bribe them to eat more. Learning to ignore their body’s signals of fullness can put them at risk of obesity in the future. Try to relax and enjoy your own meal instead—perhaps we would all be healthier if we ate only until we were no longer hungry.Encouraging happy eatingMealtimes are an important part of family life. What’s more, they are the perfect opportunity for your toddler to see everyone enjoying sharing food and conversation and trying new dishes.Make eating and drinking a pleasant social time together. Sit at the table with your toddler for drinks and snacks and have something yourself. Children love to imitate others.• Allow your baby or toddler to feed themselves without pressure. Many picky eaters will eat more if they can feed themselves. This can also be helpful if you think your child overeats as it can slow down the process, giving their brain the chance to register signals of fullness.• Offer your toddler foods the family is eating or foods you have to hand.  Don’t invest lots of time and effort cooking something separately for them. They need to eat because he is hungry, not to please you.• Offer limited options if giving a choice. Too much to choose from can be overwhelming and unhelpful for a young child.• Avoid foods packaged specifically for children—they are expensive, may come in overly large portions and some are packed with sugar, salt, fat and other unnecessary ingredients. Limit juices and sugary drinks, which fill toddlers up without giving a wide range of nutrients. Offer water instead.• Offer small portions—they can always have more. If your child has snacked throughout the day they may not want to sit down and eat a full dinner. Young children need regular snacks and drinks but make sure those on offer are a balance of nutritious ones and bear this in mind when judging mealtime portion size.• Accept it when they say they have had enough and let them leave the table.• Avoid praising them for eating or describing food as ‘good for you’. Instead describe what you’re both eating: ”What a crunchy apple!” “What long spaghetti!’’• Try keeping foods separate from one another. Some children reject mixed foods if there is one taste or texture they don’t like.• Try involving children in food preparation, but be aware that some children may refuse to eat certain foods when they know what goes into them.Should I limit breastfeeds?Although you may want to offer your toddler solid foods before nursing, there’s no reason to stop breastfeeding altogether. Both mothers and children find the closeness and connection of breastfeeding an important reason for carrying on, and for taking weaning gradually. Breastmilk continues to be a nutritious, calorie dense food—as well as a drink. And it still helps protect him from infections, just as it did when he was tiny.Night waking?You may wonder if your night-waking toddler is hungry. Night-time can be an opportunity to catch up on nursing, away from distractions, especially if your days are busy or you are separated during the day. You could encourage more daytime nursing instead or offer a drink in a cup when they wake at night. If they believe nursing is the only way to fall asleep you can gently encourage other sleep associations. Or perhaps they need the security of being close to you when they wake in the dark? Many mothers still find nursing a little one back to sleep much easier than getting up and pacing the floor at night. It’s also quite normal for non-nursing toddlers to wake in the night needing a parent.Breastfeeding and obesityIt’s impossible simply to say ‘breastfeeding prevents obesity’. How a baby is breastfed and then introduced to solids may be as important, if not more so, than just receiving breastmilk. Babies who are allowed control over their own feeding patterns will consume only as much breastmilk as they need. They take in just the right amount of calories and set in place appropriate ‘appetite control’. The baby who is left to show signs of readiness for solid food and is able to choose from a range of healthy family foods what they eat and how much may be learning to control their appetite in a way that will help prevent obesity in later life.Nutritional needsBreastfed babies are often very good at moderating their own intake of food and drink to get what they need. Over the years researchers have found that, given the opportunity to select from a range of nutritious foods, toddlers balance their own intake, but over a period of weeks rather than days.Do they need cows’ milk?You may be told to give your toddler the equivalent of a pint of full fat cows’ milk a day to meet their calcium needs. Many nursing toddlers take this amount of breastmilk without their mothers realising it! You can offer cows’ milk and other dairy products but don’t be surprised if they’ve already had enough milk.What about iron?The iron in breastmilk is in a form that’s easy to absorb. But babies and children over six months should be offered (though not forced to eat) additional foods that are naturally rich in iron to ensure they get enough. The World Health Organization strongly recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. At six months, other foods should complement breastfeeding for up to two years or more.Change continuesThings are always changing where toddlers are concerned, so today’s fussy eater may quite easily become tomorrow’s gourmet. And once he becomes a teenager, he could be eating you out of house and home! Just as you trusted your breastfed baby to show you he had taken enough milk, you can trust that the toddler who is well, active and growing is getting what he needs, however little he eats. If you have concerns about your child’s eating, you may find it helpful to speak to an LLL Leader or go to an LLL meeting where you can meet other mothers who have been in your situation.Written by Sue Upstone & mothers of LLLGB.Further ReadingStarting Solid FoodStill Nursing?Thinking of Weaning?BooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

"Human milk is the perfect first foodIntroducing your baby to other foods is a big milestone, and can be fun too. The simplest approach is to continue your usual breastfeeding pattern and let your baby join you at family mealtimes. Your baby will be able to learn about new foods gradually and in their own time.Signs of readiness for complementary foodsBabies begin eating solid foods according to their own unique timetables, just as they will walk and talk when they are ready. Readiness to try new foods is just another developmental step and it isn’t necessary to do anything special.Babies show signs of readiness for complementary foods (to complement their milk intake) around the middle of the first year.Although previous research suggested that signs of readiness for starting solids were related to developmental changes which happen at around 4 months, recent research indicates the following signs of readiness:1Fact: Ability to sit up well when supportedOnce your baby can sit up well when supported (for at least a few minutes) let them join you at family mealtimes and allow them to pick up food.Fact: Loss of the tongue thrust reflexBabies who have not yet lost their tongue thrust reflex will push food out of their mouth with their tongue. The tongue thrust reflex is a sign that they are not developmentally ready for solid food.Fact: Ability to pick up food, put it in their mouth and chewA baby who is able to reach out and grab a piece of food, then bring it to their mouth and chew it is generally ready for solids. Research indicates that the ideal time to start solid food in terms of oral-motor developmental readiness is between six and eight months. As with other developmental stages, babies learn to chew when they are ready, not because solid food has been introduced by six months.Myth: Breastfeeding more oftenYour baby may ask to breastfeed more, yet still not be ready for solid food. They may just be unwell, having a growth spurt, teething, or reacting to stress. Offering your baby both breasts during each feed may be all that is needed.Myth: Waking at nightWaking at night is normal and common behaviour and is not a sign that a baby is ready to start other foods even if they have previously slept for longer periods.Myth: Watching you eatBabies are interested in and want to copy what they see around them, so watching others eat does not necessarily mean they are ready to start eating solid foods.Why follow your baby’s cues?Human milk is the most important food in your baby’s diet during their first year, providing them with most of the calories and fluids they need, as well as a wide range of nutrients. Allowing solids to replace breastmilk too quickly may lead to undernutrition, imbalance of nutrients, or poor weight gain. Breastfeeding continues to be a valuable source of nutrition and calories if your baby is unwell or teething, and doesn’t want to eat solid food.Breastfeeding provides your baby with antibodies, other immune factors, stem cells, and many other components unique to breastmilk. Breastfeeding alongside introducing solids helps to prevent harmful bacteria, such as E.coli, growing in your baby’s gut. Replacing your milk with solid food too early reduces the level of protection they receive.Developmental readiness inside and outYour baby’s digestive system gradually matures during the first six months. Introducing solids when  your baby is developmentally ready means they will be able to eat and digest these new foods.Preterm babies, babies with special needs or developmental delay may not be ready for solids until later than six months. Following their readiness signs will help you know when to offer solids. Speak to your baby’s healthcare team regarding their individual nutritional needs.Carry on breastfeedingStarting solid food is a new experience for your baby and is about taste, texture and learning new skills, not about replacing your milk. Babies are more likely to try something new if they aren’t too hungry – they may refuse solids when they really want to breastfeed. Remember that your baby isn’t likely to eat very much to start with.You may feel pressured into limiting breastfeeds so that your baby will take more solid food, but this can have the opposite effect. If your baby is happy and content after a breastfeed they may be more open to the idea of trying some new foods.Breastmilk gradually and gently introduces babies to the foods their mother eats because traces of those appear in her milk. This provides a variety of flavour experiences in a natural way, helping prepare the baby for the foods they will eat at the family table. Babies will want to eat whatever food is on the table, so this is a good opportunity to review the whole family’s diet.First tastesBaby–led weaningThe principle behind baby-led weaning is that babies will instinctively start to feed themselves when they are developmentally ready, given the opportunity. The skills to feed themselves and readiness of their body to process food occur naturally and do not need to be taught.Babies who are in control of feeding themselves (in contrast with spoon feeding) will only be able to pick up food, put it in their mouth and chew it when they are developmentally ready. This approach also lets babies determine which foods and how much they want to eat: they will naturally progress at their own pace and reduce breastfeeds when they are ready.Allowing babies to join in with family mealtimes will expose them to a wide variety of different foods, enable them to copy how other children and adults eat, and help make eating a pleasant experience, encouraging a positive lifelong relationship with food. A baby who is allowed free choice of good, nutritious foods tends to balance their own diet.For more information on baby-led weaning, see book Baby-led Weaning: The Essential Guide (2019).How to present food – shapes and sizesBabies love to use their hands, so offer foods that they can easily hold and put into their mouth. Until they have developed a pincer grip, babies can’t pick up small pieces of food. Offer sticks or pieces of food the shape/size of an adult’s finger. Most 6-month-old babies will be able to pick up the piece, hold it in their fist and gnaw the end sticking out of their fist.Softer foods can be spread on unsalted oat cakes, rice cakes or crackers, or dipped into with a suitable piece of food so your baby can manage by themselves. For tastes of soup, yoghurt or porridge, offer your baby a spoon with a small amount of food on, or let them dip their fingers in and lick off the food.Different tastes and texturesIt is important to offer your baby a wide variety of different foods as this will expose them to a range of tastes and textures. The ability to explore the different taste,  texture,colour and smell of food may help babies to have a healthier relationship with food.Aim to offer tastes of a wide variety of foods in as close to their natural state as possible. Given access to a range of food groups, your baby will show you what they need. If they don’t want a certain food, try something else, but do offer it again.You don’t need to purée foods or even mash them. Puréeing often requires liquid to be added, diluting the nutritional content. Solid (un-mashed) food aids development of chewing skills, which babies don’t get from sucking puréed food. Early exposure to different textures can also prevent a baby refusing to eat lumpy food later on.Gagging and chokingGagginghappens when food triggers a baby’s gag reflex and the food is pushed forwards to prevent it from blocking the airway. A baby gagging will usually be calm and breathing normally. Gagging is a natural protective mechanism to prevent choking and usually doesn’t need any intervention.Chokinghappens when a baby’s airway is (fully or partially) blocked and they can’t breathe. A baby choking will be coughing or silent (unable to make any noise), not breathing, and their face or lips may change colour. Choking is an emergency and they may need first aid to clear the blockage.Babies are less likely to choke on food if they are sitting upright and feeding themself. Research shows baby-led weaning is not associated with an increased risk of choking.2Certain foods are a choking risk for children under three years of age and should be avoided, including whole grapes, whole cherry tomatoes, popcorn, large amounts of peanut butter and any food that could break off in large chunks, such as raw carrot, hard apple or celery sticks. Nuts are a choking risk up to five years of age.At first, you may want to check your baby’s mouth for unswallowed food after a meal, including their cheeks and palate. Never leave your baby alone with food or when they are eating.Plan for a little mess!Solid foods are another part of the world your baby is exploring and they will do this as much by touch and smell as by taste. This can be messy, but is an important learning experience for them. To make cleaning up easier, roll up their sleeves, use a bib or apron and put a clean plastic cloth on the floor so you can safely re-offer dropped foods.Natural appetite controlIt is normal for your baby’s appetite to go up and down over the course of days, weeks and months. Don’t worry. Just offer more of any food they ask for and stop when they don’t want any more. There is no need to ‘top them up’ with a spoon if they haven’t eaten much at a meal. Allowing a baby to feed themselves and take their time over a meal helps them to tune in to their feelings of fullness and to stop eating, which is important throughout their life.If your baby refuses food, they are not rejecting you or your efforts. They may simply not be hungry. If they are ill or teething, unrestricted breastfeeding will ensure they receive good nutrition and will comfort them until they feel well and interested again.Allergy & Food IntoleranceCommon allergensThe most common allergens (in order of incidence) are:Milk and other dairy products such as butter, yoghurt, cheese, whey, casein, caseinate, lactoseEggPeanut and tree nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, etc.)SoyWheatFish and Shellfish: crustaceans (e.g. crab, lobster, crayfish, shrimp, prawn), molluscs (e.g. mussels, oysters, squid)Sesame seeds (in tahini and hummus)Lupin/lentils (including chickpeas which are in hummus)Fenugreek (closely related to peanuts)Celery and celeriacMustardIntroducing peanut and eggPeanut and hen’s egg are common allergens for babies. Current guidance recommends that foods containing peanut or hen’s egg need not be differentiated from other solid foods and can be introduced from around 6 months along with other foods.The deliberate exclusion of peanut or hen’s egg beyond 6 to 12 months of age may increase the risk of allergy to the same foods. Once introduced, and where tolerated, these foods should continue to be part of your child’s usual diet. If initial exposure is not continued as part of your child’s usual diet, then this may increase the risk of sensitisation and subsequent food allergy.3EczemaIf your baby has eczema, suspected food allergy, or a family history of food allergy you may wish to seek medical advice before introducing allergenic foods. If eczema is well-controlled (i.e. mild or cleared), it is easier to assess your baby’s tolerance to new foods.Offer allergenic foods in very small amounts and watch carefully for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. If eczema becomes difficult to manage after food introduction, stop the allergen and seek medical advice.Allergic reactions and symptoms to watch forIn very rare cases allergy can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylactic shock. If your baby has a severe and immediate allergic reaction, which may include swelling of the lips, tongue, eyes or face, seek emergency medical care.Food sensitivity reactions can include eczema, nettle rash (urticaria), a sore bottom, wheezing, asthma, colic, vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. If a food causes a mild reaction, talk to your health visitor or doctor about whether you should continue to give it. For further information, seeAllergies & Food Intolerances.Nutrition RequirementsVitamins and mineralsThe UK Department of Health recommend that all babies be given supplements including vitamins A, C and D from 6 months, and a vitamin D supplement from birth for breastfed babies and those receiving less than 500ml of formula per day.4IronA healthy full-term baby has sufficient iron stores at birth, and delayed cord clamping helps to increase a baby’s iron levels. Iron is present in human milk and bioavailable to the baby, which is sufficient for the first 6 months of a baby’s life. Introduce iron rich foods from six months such as meat, poultry, fish, egg, pulses/legumes (e.g. chickpeas and lentils) and fortified cereals.Vitamin DThis is produced when our bodies are exposed to sufficient sunlight. Wearing clothes and suncream to protect against skin cancer limits how much vitamin D we can produce. Vitamin D supplements are particularly important for babies who have limited exposure to sunlight and for babies with darker skin colour living in the UK. Breastmilk doesn’t contain high levels of vitamin D as, in the past, babies would absorb most of their vitamin D from exposure to sunlight.Vitamin B12This is found in animal protein. Your baby may need vitamin B12 supplements if you eat a strict vegetarian or vegan diet.5Nutritional needs of preterm babiesA premature baby does not have a good iron store at birth. If your baby was born before 34 weeks, they may already be receiving iron, zinc and vitamin supplements. Your preterm baby’s healthcare team will be able to give more specific guidance regarding their individual nutritional needs.Good First FoodsOffering your baby a wide variety of foods in as close to their natural state as possible will ensure they receive a range of nutrients. Highly processed, low-fat or ready-prepared adult foods are not suitable for babies. You don’t need to buy ready-prepared baby food. These foods are expensive, often come in over-large portions and may contain added ingredients your baby doesn’t need. If you choose to buy convenience foods, check labels carefully.To preserve nutrients as much as possible, bake, steam or cook foods in water. Take out a small portion for your baby before adding any salt or sugar to the rest. Allow it to cool to a suitable temperature. Offering finger foods avoids the need to add extras your baby may not be ready for, such as milk or butter.Note: Some foods can trigger allergic reactions in some babies. See further down this article for more information.FoodServing SuggestionNotesVegetables (e.g. carrot, pea,  sweet potato, potato)Cook lightly to soften if  needed. Give sticks or adult finger-sizedpieces.Remove skin if needed. Avoid small chunks of raw hard vegetables, such as carrots, which could cause choking.Fruit (e.g. apple, banana, avocado)Give your baby a whole fruit or large piece to hold.Remove skin and stones if needed. Small chunks can cause chokingPoultry (e.g. chicken)MeatGive large pieces of lean cooked meat, moisten with meat juices.Make sure to remove any  bones and gristle.FishPoach in a little water (no salt) or oven bake.Check carefully for bones.Fish can be allergenic so introduce it with caution. Don’t introduce shellfish, smoked fish or pickled fish until your baby is over 12 months.Rice cakesOat cakesCrackersSpread soft foods on, or use them for dipping.Plain, unsalted rice cakes, oat cakes and crackers are useful alternatives to rusks.BeansLentilsCooked beans and lentils canbe mashed to make a spread or dip.Cook all beans and lentils thoroughly.Dried fruitCut up larger fruits such asapricots. Apricots and prunescan be cooked in a smallamount of water to make anutritious spread.Although rich in nutrients, dried fruit can stick to teeth and if given frequently cancause tooth decay even if you clean your baby’s teeth regularly.Wholegrain cereals such as oats, corn (maize) and wheatCan be cooked with water, without salt, sugar or sweetener. Choose  unsweetened breakfast cereals.Most cereals contain a protein called gluten, a potential sensitizer, so avoid mixed-grain cereals until you know your baby can tolerate each one individually.BreadPastaRiceBread and pasta are easy finger foods. Serve pasta plain, with butter or grated cheese.Avoid pasta made with eggs until you know your baby can tolerate egg.Cottage cheese, yoghurt, fromage frais, butter, unprocessed cheeseYour baby can use a spoon ortheir fingers. Useful with cooked vegetables. Grate cheese or serve slices.Use unsalted butter.EggsCan be served scrambled,boiled, poached, in an omelette, etc.If lion-stamped, egg can be served raw. Otherwise, cook until both white and yolk are solid.Nuts and seeds (e.g. peanut butter, tahini)Should be spread thinly. Only use smooth varieties.Never give whole nuts or seeds until 5 years of age. Crunchy nut butter varieties can cause choking.Foods to avoidSaltcan overload a baby’s system and too much can cause kidney failure. Highly salted foods may foster a taste for salty foods. Avoid and minimize the use of processed  foods, packet mixes, crisps, savoury snacks, gravy and condiments such as ketchup, yeast extract, mustard and  brown sauce. When buying convenience foods look for low salt versions, including tinned beans and vegetables canned only in water.White sugarcontains virtually no nutrients and is a major factor in tooth decay. When checking food labels watch for other names for sugars – such as glucose, dextrose, sucrose, corn syrup and fructose.Molasses, maple syrup and honeyare also almost pure sugar and can displace healthy nutritious foods. Many processed foods which are advertised for babies have high sugar content and should be avoided, includingteething biscuitsandbaby rusks.Honeymay contain botulism spores and should not be given to babies younger than one year.Teething biscuitsare often high in sugar. Your baby can teethe using anything hard and safe to chew on, including unsalted rice cakes or crusty bread.Artificial sweetenersare present in many processed foods and drinks aimed at babies and children, includingjuice drinks, ready mealsandjars, andsnack foods. Children who eat food with artificial sweeteners may be more likely to develop a ‘sweet tooth’ and a preference for sweet food in later life.Artificial flavouringsandfood colouringare unnecessary chemicals.Foods high in saturated fats.While babies need fats in their diet, foods containing unnecessary saturated fats, such asfried foods, should be offered only in moderation.Very hot spicy food. Many babies like spicy food, but very hot spices, especiallychillies, may be unpleasant for a baby.Shark,swordfishandmarlinall contain high levels of mercury.DrinksWater, human milk and formula are the only recommended drinks until 1 year old.At mealtimes offer some plain tap water in a baby-sized (shot glass size) cup. You don’t need to use bottles or spouted cups but, if you do, a free flow cup is better than one with a non-spill valve on which a baby needs to bite to get the drink to flow.Avoid juices, sugary drinks and those with artificial sweeteners. Even unsweetened juices contain natural fruit sugars and acids that can damage teeth. They can leave no room for nutritious foods and it can be hard to limit them once you start them.Avoid giving bottled water, which may have high mineral levels, and drinks that contain caffeine. This includes fizzy and other soft drinks, tea and coffee.Can I offer cow’s milk as a drink?Cow’s milk is not suitable as a drink until after 12 months. Instead offer water, human milk or formula. However, you can use cow’s milk when cooking for your baby, for example in porridge and sauces. Other dairy products can be offered to your baby as a food e.g. cheese, yogurt, cream.After 1 year of age, cow’s milk can be given as a drink. Follow-on and toddler formulas are not necessary.Further ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. LLLI. London: Pinter & Martin, 2010.My Child Won’t Eat. González, C. MD.

"If your baby needs a supplement of expressed breastmilk or formula, a nursing supplementer can help you enjoy the closeness of breastfeeding while your milk production increases.You can use a supplementer to:Stimulate breastmilk production while feeding infant formula or expressed mil, without using bottles.Breastfeed an adopted baby.Breastfeed as a non-birth parent.Maintain breastfeeding if your milk production isn’t able to meet your baby’s needs eg insufficient glandular tissue.Maintain breastfeeing if your milk production is compromised eg breast surgery or reduction.Encourage a baby who is reluctant to breastfeed.Breastfeed a baby who is unable to feed effectively because of sucking or health problems. However this will only work if you baby can feed well enough to obtain milk.How it worksHow to useAvailable productsDifferent supplementsHow to use a nursing supplementerCleaningEliminating supplementsSeek SupportHow it worksA nursing supplementer lets a baby get any supplement he needs at the breast without using bottles. The supplementer container holds the milk, which travels through a tube into your baby’s mouth while he breastfeeds. As he swallows, he continues sucking, stimulating your milk production.If you are breastfeeding expressing your milk, and giving top-ups to your baby, you may find it simpler to use a supplementer, which allows all the feeding to happen at the breast.A good latch-onIt’s especially important that your baby latches on deeply at the breast when you are using a supplementer. Get help withpositioning and attachmentso your baby can get milk from the breast as well as from the supplementer.Different supplementsExpressed breastmilkYour expressed breastmilk is the first choice for a supplement. If your baby has feeding difficulties, expressing will help you maintain and increase your milk production. To find our more about increasing your supply, see our articleHow to Increase Your Milk Supply. And for more information onExpressing Your Milkour article can help.Donor milkHuman milk banks provide pasteurized, screened donor milk.Infant formulaConcentrated and ready-to-feed forms of infant formula are less likely to clog nursing supplementer tubing than powdered forms. Although expensive, ready-to-feed formula may also be more convenient when you are out and about or at home without help. Powdered infant formula is not sterile, so always follow theNHS guidelinesfor preparing it.Available productsDisposable bag systemThis uses disposable sterile plastic bags with a top opening and a single tube. Milk only flows when a baby sucks and it is discreet to use as the bags are not bulky or noisy. You can also feed lying down without fear of leaks. When your baby sucks, the flow increases as the flow of milk from your breast decreases. This reinforces proper suckling, making the most of your milk production. (As in photograph above.)Bottle systemThis system uses a bottle with a tube for each breast, making switching sides easy or for twins. Each tube can be clamped. Three tube widths are available. Sets can be cleaned and reused. (As seen in the photograph below.)Homemade systemYou can make your own supplementer using an ordinary baby bottle, bottle teat and an infant nasogastric feeding tube (size #5 french, 52-75 length). Tubing can be obtained from online suppliers. (As seen in the first and last photos in this article.)Cut a small hole in the bottle teat so the tube fits tightly. Thread the tube through the teat from the inside and attach the teat normally so the end of the tube sits in the supplement. The tube end is rounded and won’t hurt your baby’s mouth. Pierce a second hole in the teat, or use a teat with a vent to allow air in so your baby won’t need to suck harder as the bottle empties. The bottle needs to stay upright. You may find tucking it into your bra keeps it in place.Photo courtesy of Michelle GreenHow to use a nursing supplementerIntroduce the tube into your baby’s mouth along with the breast at the very beginning of a breastfeed by placing it between your baby’s upper lip and cupped tongue. If your baby doesn’t like the feel of the tube on the roof of his mouth try placing it so it lies along his tongue. Or, slip the tube into the corner of your baby’s mouth once he is well-attached at the breast.You may need to extend the tube past the end of your nipple – experiment to see what works for your baby. The tube can be secured to your breast with medical tape. Taping along the tube is generally more secure than taping across it.To hold the tube in position some mothers use fabric sticking plasters cut from a long strip. They thread the tube under the non-sticky sections.The tube can be easily removed while the plasters stay in place, reducing skin irritation from tape removal and providing a guide for positioning each time.Milk flow – too fast or too slow?Constant milk flow can cause ineffective feeding as your baby will not need to actively suck to get milk. When using a supplementer you will see the milk travel along the tube to your baby’s mouth. Adjust the tube position and container height so your baby gets milk quickly when he starts sucking. Check he isn’t overwhelmed with milk, especially if he has heart or breathing difficulties or is premature.Slow down the flow of milk by lowering the milk container, raising the tubing or using thinner tubing. Or pinch the tube to slow or stop milk flow. If using the bottle system, stop milk flowing by clamping the tube in the slots in the bottle likd. To speed up milk flow, raise the bottle, use wider tubing or use two tubes at the same breast. You may need to adjust the tube in your baby’s mouth to create more suction.CleaningTo avoid having to throw away tubing when milk had dried inside, force cold water through the tube at least three times straight after use, using the bottle of a 5-10ml syringe. Using warm water may cause fat to cling to the sides of the tube.For commercial supplementers follow the manufacturers’ cleaning instructions. For homemade systems, follow the NHS guidance when cleaning the bottles and teats. Wash the tubing with hot soapy water, rinse with clean water and force air through the tube (or spin the tube fast) to dry. Take extra care if using infant formula. Store the clean supplementer parts in a sealed container in the fridge.Nasogastic tubes should not be boiled, steamed or chemically sterilised as they are not designed for multiple uses. If your baby is at a higher risk of infection, a commercial system may be a safer option than a homemade system. Replace the nasogastric tube when it starts to stiffen, after about a week.Eliminating supplementsThe use of infant formula is sometimes essential to meet a baby’s nutritional needs. You may need to use formula as a stopgap measure, while you work to increase your milk production. Supplementing with formula without protecting your milk supply may reduce the duration of your breastfeeding experience.Over time, you may be able to reduce the amount of supplement your baby needs as your milk production increases. Expressing in between feeds will signal to your breasts to make  more milk and give you some milk for the next feed. For more onIncreasing Your Milk Supply, see our article.Begin the feed with your baby taking milk just from the breast. When he is no longer swallowing regularly start the supplementer. If your baby is reluctant to nurse at all, start the milk flowing at the beginning of a feed to get him started.  As your breasts start to make more milk you will notice your baby takes less supplement, especially at certain times of day.For more information on managing and reducing supplements seeMy Baby Needs More MilkandRelactation and Induced Lactation.Seek supportWhether using a supplementer as a temporary or a long-term solution, support from your localLLL Leader and groupcan be a great help. For individual face-to-face help or a home visit, you could also consult a board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) or specialist breastfeeding clinic.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone & mothers of LLLGB.

"Not so long ago you first held your tiny newborn and started on your breastfeeding journey together. Suddenly time has passed and you find yourself still breastfeeding an older baby or toddler – something you may never have envisaged doing! At this point you may wonder whether your child will end up ‘nursing forever’.For many mothers, it is other people’s expectations which are the problem. Almost as soon as breastfeeding is going well, people seem to start asking when you intend to stop! Coping with pressure from others to stop breastfeeding is not easy, but you will know in your heart what feels right for you and your child.Why nursing is still importantYour milk is still nutritiousAlthough you will be introducing your breastfed baby to the exciting world of solid foods from around 6 months of age, your milk will remain his most important food until at least 12 months. Beyond this, breastmilk is still a valuable contribution to your child’s diet, providing up to a third of both his daily calories and protein needs after 18 months, as well as being a good source of vitamins and minerals. Toddlers often eat varying amounts from day to day so it can be reassuring to know your child is still getting your milk.Protection from illnessBreastmilk continues to complement and boost your child’s immune system. Whilst breastfeeding is no guarantee that a toddler won’t become ill, it can help reduce the severity of any illness. When he is ill, breastmilk may be the only food or drink he can manage, especially during bouts of vomiting or diarrhoea. Nursing is also very comforting to a poorly toddler and can make it easier for you to cope with his illness. (See our articleAmazing Milk.)Comfort and securityNursing offers security at a time when your child is developing fast and the world seems a confusing place. A mother is often surprised at how important breastfeeding remains to her older baby or toddler.Breastfeeding beyond babyhood is normal‘Weaning’ is the process whereby a child learns to take nourishment other than his mother’s milk. It starts when the child is introduced to foods and drinks in addition to breastmilk, and endswhen he finally stops nursing. You may worry that if you don’t initiate an end to breastfeeding, your child will ‘nurse forever’.But children outgrow breastfeeding on their own, just as they outgrow other toddler behaviours. This process of ‘natural weaning’ can allow a child to develop at his own pace, giving up breastfeeding according to his own timetable. All children stop breastfeeding eventually, but some finish earlier than others. Rather than choosing a specific time to stop breastfeeding, many mothers just continue nursing while it’s working well for them and see how it goes.Mixed feelingsNot all mothers are comfortable or wish to breastfeed their babies beyond a certain point. Or perhaps you feel that your child is nursing too much, or more than you are comfortable with? Before rushing to wean, consider whether breastfeeding really does make your life harder. Your child will need your constant attention and care for years yet, whether he is breastfeeding or not. Sometimes needs can be met more simply and easily through nursing than in any other way.For many mothers, shortening feeds or reducing their frequency is enough to make them feel more positive about breastfeeding and confident that it will eventually end.Thinking Of Weaning?, How Breastfeeding Ends and the bookMothering Your Nursing Toddleroffer suggestions on how to reduce or end breastfeeding gently while still meeting your child’s needs. Your local LLL Leader will have suggestions, and other mothers in yourlocal LLL groupwill have found their own solutions too.Comments from othersYour biggest challenge may be coping with the opinions of others on how long you should continue to breastfeed and how weaning should happen. Explaining the importance of breastfeeding may seem threatening to people who made other choices. Instead, help them feel more comfortable by mentioning how breastfeeding makes life easier for you, your child and your family. You might say that you didn’t plan to nurse this long: “At first I planned to breastfeed him for six months. At six months I decided to wean him at a year.” Or, “Before he was born I hadn’t considered nursing a toddler!” Sometimes a smile and a witty response may do the trick: “When is he going to stop breastfeeding?”—“Oh, in about 5 minutes or so I expect!”Out and aboutCriticism can be easier to handle when you are happy and confident. Even so, you may start feeling uncomfortable about breastfeeding your older toddler in front of others. As a child develops theability to wait, some mothers set limits on where and when they nurse, or offer distractions at times when it’s inconvenient. You could nurse before you go out and take a healthy snack and drink to tide your toddler over until you reach the car, home or other suitable place. Selecting your own clothing carefully can help avoid accidental overexposure and choosing a convenient codeword for breastfeeding such as ‘num-nums’ or ‘milkie’ makes it less obvious when your child asks to nurse when out and about.Breastfeeding mannersSetting some gentle limits on how your older baby or toddler breastfeeds is the start of gentle discipline and guiding him into good behaviour. It starts when you hold his hand or give him a toy to stop twiddling while feeding. If your toddler tries to breastfeed in unusual or uncomfortable acrobatic positions, you can let him know that it hurts and that if he wants to nurse he needs to sit properly. It’s best to start to set limits on how you will breastfeed before behaviour becomes a problem. If a behaviour you aren’t happy with has become a habit, it may take a little perseverance to change things. But even young toddlers respond to consistent loving guidance, especially if rewarded with breastfeeding and a thank you when they behave appropriately.Conflicting adviceSome people, even health professionals, who are unfamiliar with breastfeeding an older baby or toddler, may claim that nursing beyond a certain age leads to spoiling, tooth decay, obesity or any number of other consequences! There is no evidence for this. A child’s secure attachment actually leads to independence.There is evidence that tooth decay is dependent on the presence of certain oral bacteria and enamel defects. Limiting sugary foods (including dried fruit), drinks and sweets, and careful cleaning are better preventions than ending breastfeeding. There is also evidence that obesity is more prevalent in children who are not breastfed.Children all develop at different rates: crawling, walking and talking at different ages. Why should weaning be any different? Children’s needs for sucking and closeness vary. If your child enjoys breastfeeding and it makes him feel good, what a great reason for snuggling up with himBenefits for youBreastfeeding helps:• Calm an overtired or fussy child.• Soothe you both if your child is hurt or in pain.• Ease frustration and recovery from toddler tantrums. While clingy, demanding behaviour is normal in young children, some families find that when breastfeeding continues, the ‘terrible twos’ turn into ‘terrific twos’.• You stay calmer and drift back to sleep more easily, thanks to those breastfeeding hormones.• Reduce your risk of developing breast cancerThinking of weaning?If you are thinking of taking active steps to end breastfeeding there are lots of suggestions inThinking of Weaning?and How Breastfeeding Ends. The ‘don’t offer, don’t refuse’ method can be a helpful approach after the first year. Simply continue meeting your toddler’s need to nurse if he is hurt, tired or upset and wait until he asks when his need is less obvious. Offer a healthy snack, drink or a story instead—and see how he reacts. Encouraging your child to help you around the house and get involved in play can provide natural distractions when he doesn’t really need to nurse. Setting appropriate limits is the start of gentle discipline and can be a way of saving your breastfeeding relationship. How long your toddler is able to wait will depend on the situation, his age and temperament. Do make sure that you follow through and offer the promised feed later, so he trusts you and is willing to wait.Wanting another babyRegular periods generally signal the return of fertility. Whilst some mothers who aren’t using contraception become pregnant while nursing a toddler, others don’t become pregnant until after breastfeeding ends. Every mother responds differently to the stimulus of breastfeeding and there are no easy answers. Some mothers try partial weaning in the hope of getting pregnant, but many simply wait knowing that, with time, the breastfeeding relationship will become less intense and fertility will return.PregnancyPregnant nursing motherssometimes receive conflicting advice about whether to wean. Some mothers find their child weans naturally during the pregnancy. Other mothers continue to breastfeed during pregnancy and may go on to feed both children. This is called tandem nursing. See Further Reading for more information.Finding supportIt is easy to feel isolated when the reality of life with a baby or toddler does not meet your expectations. Being able to meet other mothers in similar situations can be a great help. La Leche League groups welcome mothers at any stage of breastfeeding, so you will often find mothers breastfeeding older babies and toddlers at your local group meeting. Some LLL groups run toddler meetings where you can share experiences and tips.Feelings, needs and expectationsYour own feelingsHowever you feel, do take care of yourself so you can enjoy caring for your child. Avoid making quick decisions to wean. A break, a nap, a bath, or just something to eat or drink, may be all you need to recharge before deciding what you want to do. Breastfeeding is a two-way relationship, and your needs are important too. You can adjust your approach as situations change. It isn’t easy when you are ready to stop breastfeeding, and your baby isn’t. To help your child move on, try to end breastfeeding gradually and with love while giving him your time and attention in other ways. Encouragement and support are always helpful when our children are moving on in life, from toddlerhood to teenage years.An intense need for mumA baby has an intense need to be with his mother that is as important as his need for food. Breastfeeding is not just food—it helps your toddler maintain the close attachment to you that has been his security up until now. The security of a baby’s bond with his mother is the basis for all other relationships and will help him to become more independent as he grows and develops.There are many reasons why children need extra reassurance from nursing. Many little ones want to nurse only occasionally, perhaps for going to sleep and if they hurt themselves. But if your child seems to breastfeed avidly, it can help to look at what is happening in his life and yours. Perhaps he spends time away from you or particular demands on your time and attention take you away from him, such as other children, the telephone, the Internet or your job. Are you meeting his needs for attention, conversation and playmates, in addition to snacks and drinks, before he asks to nurse? You too may have got used to thinking that nursing meets every need. As they get older, children crave your focused attention as well. Sometimes nursing replaces other important contact: playing, exploring the great outdoors and taking part in household tasks.If you need to be apart at times, his need for closeness may be more intense than ever when you are together. Satisfying this need will help equip your child for times when you are away. Many older children enjoy spending time with dad and only ask to nurse when mum is around. Young children often pick up on any emotional stress in the family, or changes such as moving house. Major growth and development milestones, illness or allergies could also be factors that influence his need for you. If you are feeling uncertain or worried about limiting nursing, you may find your child becomes anxious and asks to nurse more frequently. On the other hand, if you are confident about your decision and able to give of yourself lovingly in other ways, weaning is likely to go more smoothly.Dad’s feelingsPerhaps your partner isn’t comfortable with his child continuing to breastfeed now that he is older. He may feel his toddler is too dependent on you, or that breastfeeding is only for babies. In your eyes your child is still your babywhilst others see him or her as a big boy or girl who can walk and talk. It can help to share your feelings honestly with your partner and listen carefully to how he feels. He might find talking to another dad whose child nursed longer, or meeting a confident independent child who breastfed for a long time helps ease his concerns.ExpectationsSometimes our expectations simply don’t fit with the needs of our individual children. While our society often expects babies to be weaned from the breast within a year, no one seems to question that many two and three year olds still suck on bottles, thumbs, or dummies, or need a comfort object. If you meet your child’s need for closeness and security the need will be fulfilled, allowing him to grow and move on at his own pace. Even the clingiest toddlers have grown into independent, adventurous adults.All children are different, but Ruth’s story shows how allowing a child to enjoy the nursing relationship and develop at his own pace pays dividends in the end:“I know that some people look at a small boy climbing on his mum’s knee to nurse, hiding his face shyly in mum’s shoulder, or perhaps insisting on climbing into the family bed rather than his own, and worry that this little chap will grow up to be a ‘mummy’s boy’.If anyone you know has expressed such concerns, you might like to let him know about my son Michael. He nursed until he was four, preferred to stay home and not go to playgroup until he was four and a quarter, and frequented the family bed for a quite a while. But at the age of eighteen Michael completed his RAF Regiment training, a very physically demanding course. Only eight of the original thirty-one recruits got through. Now a Corporal, Michael is a confident, mature and very caring young man.”Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of LLLGB.‘Breastfeeding on the Tube’ – photo courtesy Brendan WilliamsFurther ReadingAdventures in Gentle Discipline Flower, H.

Options may include giving birth in hospital, at home or at a birthing centre. Your choice may affect which midwifery team(s) care for you during pregnancy and labour. Think about giving birth supported by caring people you feel comfortable with. Follow your instincts to find a place where you can feel safe and private during and afterwards. If you feel stressed in labour, your body naturally produces ‘fight-or-flight’ hormones that may slow down labour and delay birth. If you feel in control, you are less likely to need unnecessary birth interventions that can affect breastfeeding.Questions to askWhich midwifery team(s) will be looking after me during my labour?Will I be able to get to know the midwives beforehand?Are options such as a low-tech birthing room or birth pool available, and how often are they used?If I give birth at home or in a birthing centre, what will happen if I need to move to hospital?Do the staff encourage labour in a variety of positions—for example, walking, standing, kneeling, kneeling while leaning forwards and holding on to something, or being on all-fours?Will I be encouraged to hold my baby in skin-to-skin contact as soon as he is born and to continue to hold him afterwards as often and as long as I want?HospitalsA hospital that is a certified UNICEF Baby Friendly Hospital, or is working towards certification, will be implementing the UNICEFTen Steps to Successful Breastfeeding programme. It’s a good idea to plan a hospital visit before making up your mind.  The websitewww.birthchoiceuk.comalso has information on options, including statistics on caesarean section rates. According to The World Health Organisation, caesarean rates of more than 15% do not make birth safer.Who will support you? In addition to a midwife, many mothers choose to have their partner, friend or other family member as a birth companion. Some mothers employ a doula too. A doula is a trained, non-medical labour-support person who can support you and your partner at home during labour, in hospital and in the days after the birth.Photo courtesy of Kimberly Seals AllersLabourIt can help to think of labour as ‘work’, with each contraction bringing you nearer the birth. After spending nine months keeping your baby nourished and nurtured in your womb, your cervix has to change tactics and open up for the birth. You’ll feel your muscles working hard with the unfamiliar exercise. Most mothers can ease into an unmedicated labour which often has a wave-like natural rhythm. Breathing and relaxation techniques can be a very effective way of coping with the ebb and flow of contractions.Ways to help labour go wellPreparation: talking to other mothers, reading and attending antenatal birth classes will help you feel more ready. Write down your birth preferences and discuss them with your midwife. But be prepared to go with the flow if your circumstances or feelings change. If you have older children make sure you have organized someone to care for them, wherever you plan to give birth.Read about LLLGB’s Antenatal Breastfeeding Classeshere.Privacy: consider who you want around you during labour, and ask those supporting you to protect you from unwelcome visitors. In hospital, create your own privacy by treating the room as your space. Keep the door closed, bring your favourite music, your own pillow and wear your own clothes if possible.Eat and drink when you feel like it, especially in the early stages of labour. This gives you more energy to manage your contractions, the birth and those amazing first hours after your baby arrives. Prepare for it to take time: labour gradually develops from the normal Braxton-Hicks ‘warm-up’ contractions of your uterus, into stronger contractions that usually become painful and harder to ignore. Some women find contractions stop and start over a period of days or even weeks.Every labour is different, even if you’ve had a baby before. As labour progresses you’ll probably become more inwardly focused, concentrating on the work you are doing and less inclined to chat to the people around you. Your body will release natural pain-relieving endorphins. Towards the end you will feel like pushing.Listen to your body: move around and change position when you are uncomfortable or if labour doesn’t seem to be progressing. Follow your body’s urges; lie on your side and rest if you feel tired; wander about or go outside for a walk if you feel like it. You’re not ill—and you don’t have to labour or give birth in bed. Lying on your back during labour generally delays birth and makes it all harder. It might also mean you need more pain relief medication which can interfere with breastfeeding.Cutting the cord only after it has stopped pulsating reduces your baby’s risk of anaemia in the first year of life.Labour interventionsKnowing beforehand about possible interventions will help you to ask questions and decide whether to accept what you are offered. You might want to discuss these possibilities with your midwife. However, in the unlikely event of an emergency, medical staff will need to take action quickly to ensure the safety of you and your baby but they will tell you what is happening.InductionWhat can happen:the drug syntocinon (artificial oxytocin) is used to induce or speed up labour. It produces stronger, and possibly more painful contractions than your own naturally produced oxytocin. This often leads to further interventions, such as pain relief medication, an assisted delivery or a caesarean section.What you can do:avoid routine induction if you and your baby are healthy. Consider whether there is a family history of ‘overdue’ babies. Review your dates, weigh up the risks and talk to your midwife about waiting a little longer to see if labour will start naturally. Some believe that having sex can help you go into labour.MedicationsWhat can happen:pethidine, epidural anaesthetics etc cross the placenta into your baby’s bloodstream.He may feel groggy and have difficulty coordinating latching on and sucking at the breast for up to two weeks after the birth.What you can do:Using non-medical pain relief such as water, massage, moving around and TENS can reduce your need for medical pain relief. If your baby is affected by medications, keep him in skin-to-skin contact as much as possible, even when he’s asleep. UseBiological Nurturing™laid back breastfeeding positions so you can watch for baby feeding reflex cues like mouthing movements, lip twitches or sucking whilst asleep and help him take the breast. Until they are feeding well, frequently express drops of your colostrum directly into their mouth.Intravenous (IV) dripsWhat can happen:IV drips are used for certain induced births and caesarean births. Fluid from IV drips may cause engorgement in the early days. This makes it difficult for your baby to latch on deeply at the breast and may lead to nipple damage. Their birth weight may also be higher from any excess fluid which they then lose in the first few days.What you can do:A few hours delay in weighing your baby may give a more realistic birth weight. Frequent feeds will help you avoid or reduce engorgement as your milk volume increases. To relieveengorgement, soften your breast by gently pressing swelling away from the nipple with your fingers (a technique known as reverse pressure softening). You can also hand express some milk.Birth interventionsEpisiotomy and assisted delivery with forceps or ventouseWhat can happen:cuts and tears that need stitches may make sitting upright uncomfortable in the days after birth. Forceps or ventouse delivery can also leave your baby feeling sore, bruised and with a headache.What you can do: move around in labour and choose your own positions for the birth: kneeling while leaning forward, being on all-fours etc. When breastfeeding, use Biological Nurturing™ positions to get comfortable and to help your baby recover. These and side-lying positions also limit pressure on your baby’s head.Caesarean sectionWhat can happen:a caesarean is major abdominal surgery. You will take at least six weeks to recover from the birth and need help looking after your baby. Your baby may be affected by the anaesthetic (epidural or general) and be less able to feed well at the breast for the first few days.What you can do:Insist on skin-to-skin contact with your baby as soon as he is born. You could write this in your birth preferences beforehand, just in case. If a general anaesthetic is required, a family member can be present and hold your baby skin to-skin until you are able to, and help you hold him if you’re feeling shaky. Avoid any routine bottles—your baby can wait a short time for you. If possible reading our pages oncaesarean birthandantenatal expression of colostrumbefore you go into labour. Biological Nurturing™ and side-lying positions can help you get comfortable whilst breastfeeding. Or try an underarm rugby hold.Syntometrine injectionWhat can happen:once your baby is born, the placenta separates from the uterine wall. A routine syntometrine injection may be offered to assist this as many believe that this injection reduces the risk of excessive bleeding. Following a normal birth, few mothers need the injection. Side effects of syntometrine can include nausea or a headache, which may affect the early hours you spend with your baby.What you can do:discuss this intervention with your midwife when writing your birth preferences. Keep warm and undisturbed. Skin-to-skin contact with your baby and breastfeeding immediately after birth encourages oxytocin production. Oxytocin contracts your uterus so your placenta is expelled naturally.SeparationSometimes and for various reasons you may be separated from your baby following birth. Plan to be in close body contact with your baby as soon as possible as this is the best way to establish breastfeeding. Separation because of health concerns may make breastfeeding harder, but it’s still possible.Hold, or at least touch, your baby immediately after the birth or as soon as you can. Once you are together again make up for lost time by spending as much time as possible snuggling together skin-to-skin or lightly dressed. If your baby is in special care you can still touch and stroke him and may be able to hold him against you in ‘kangaroo mother care’ for long periods of time. And if he can’t feed at the breast straight away thenexpressingyour milk for him is important. Many mothers say that this is the single most important thing they have done while they are waiting to start breastfeeding.The first 24 hoursYour newborn baby already knows your voice and smell—and you are their whole world. He needs to be in continuous close contact with you and to have your milk as soon as he is ready. Breastfeeding is known asthe fourth stage of birth.Lean back with your baby snuggled up against you, skin-to-skin, in full body contact.Avoid interruptions until after they have had their first breastfeed. Weighing and washing need to wait—this is much more important. Watch as he nuzzles your body and uses their legs to push himself to your breast. They may turn their mouth towards your breast—the rooting reflex. Their head may bob around as he tries to latch on or he may just lick for a while. They may take a look around at their new surroundings. But sometime soon they’ll probably take a big mouthful of breast. They may feed for quite a while or they may take a few sucks and fall asleep, waking on and off, sucking and feeding whilst asleep.Your baby’s instinctive feeding responses work when he is asleep too and will help him find the breast, latch, suck and drink. Your body will respond by releasing prolactin and oxytocin, the hormones that make and release milk. These hormones also help you bond with your baby making mothering easier and more natural.Some babies will feed on and off for an hour or two, others more continuously for a shorter time. Keep your baby on your body or close by while he sleeps so you’ll notice when he is ready to feed. A young baby’s sleep cycle lasts about 60–90 minutes. Transitioning from light to deep sleep may be hard for him and it helps to hold him as he goes into deep sleep.And so to sleepIf your baby has an enjoyable feed just after birth, they may sleep for up to six hours. This gives you time to rest and eat. Hold your baby as much as you want—ideally skin-to-skin wearing just a nappy and a blanket over their back to keep him warm.If a baby is wrapped and put down, they won’t be reminded to rouse and feed. If you think they need a feed you don’t need to wake them. With them snuggled against you it’s easy to gently encourage them to latch on while they are in a light (REM) sleep. Watch for rapid eye movements under their closed eyelids, arm and leg movements, sucking activity and changes in their facial expression and then encourage them to latch on.If your baby doesn’t feed within an hour of the birth, they may sleep deeply. Keep them skin-to-skin with you and drip expressed colostrum into their mouth every hour or two until they are ready to latch on.If your baby doesn’t feed frequently over the next few days, hand express colostrum and drip it into their mouth every couple of hours, including at least once between midnight and 5am to boost your milk producing hormones. When your baby is awake, you will probably want to gaze intently at each other and enjoy getting to know one another. Read the section onWakeful Nightsfor more on sleep.If your baby needs special careYou are still the most important person to your baby. They will recognise your voice and smell and they need your milk as soon as they can take food. Breastmilk protects a baby from NEC (gut damage) and other illnesses so ask staff to show you how to hand express. If you are well, start hand expressing within six hours of the birth; if you are unwell, as soon as you feel able.Until your baby is able to breastfeed:Express milk 8–10 times in 24 hours to build your milk supply, including once during the night. You can switch to using a pump as your milk increases. Talk to your baby and touch them as much as possible. Ask staff when you can start skin-to-skin contact with them. This helps your milk production and your milk ejection reflex (let-down). It also calms and stabilises your baby and feels wonderful.Early DaysDay 2Give your baby plenty of chances to learn to breastfeed by holding them in skin-to-skin contact most of the time. You can wear a gown or loose pyjama top and wrap it round them, or cover them with a blanket. Expect your baby to feed 8 to 12 times in 24 hours, including night feeds. Relax and enjoy these special hours together.Days 3 to 5Your colostrum will start to change from golden to bluish-white as you produce more milk. Your breasts will start to feel full, even engorged or sore, making it harder for your baby to latch on well. They need to get a deep latch so feeding won’t make your nipples sore, so: breastfeed (or express) frequently. If your breasts feel softer and more comfortable after feeding, your baby is getting milk.Avoid using bottles or dummies. If a supplement is needed try using a spoon, flexible feeding cup or syringe. Use a cold compress for 15–20 minutes between feeds to reduce swelling, or place cold cabbage leaves inside your bra. Apply moist warmth to your breasts for up to two minutes just before feeding to help your milk flow.Problems with feedingIf your baby is sleepy from a difficult birth or medications used, they may not feed well. You can drip hand expressed colostrum directly into their mouth or give it to them by cup, spoon or syringe. As you produce more milk, you can use a pump until your baby is feeding well. Ask for help to get breastfeeding established. When they latch on, it should feel comfortable for you (after the first few sucks).If your baby is finding it hard to latch onWhen your baby bobs their head and licks the nipple, it naturally makes it easier to latch on. Reverse pressure softening has a similar effect by moving fluid away from the nipple area: press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple.Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola. You can also press with the sides of fingers. Place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be.Falling hormonal levels after the birth can make you feel emotional, upset or weepy. This is absolutely normal and typically lasts just a few days.JaundiceJaundice is common and normal in newborns. Getting breastfeeding off to a good start can prevent it becoming a problem which needs treatment. If your baby has jaundice, frequent breastfeeding and/or expressed breastmilk will help clear the yellow bilirubin pigment. If further treatment is needed, our pageJaundice in Healthy Newbornshas more information.Wakeful nightsWhile your baby is small, you will find some nights are particularly wakeful, including the second night just before your milk ‘comes in’. Your baby may want to feed very frequently, doze off and then wake again, protesting if put down.Keep your baby close so they can feel your presence and hear your heartbeat, just as in the womb. Let them breastfeed frequently—it will boost your milk production.If you need to put them down to sleep, wait until they fall into a deep sleep. You could cover them with a sheet or blanket while feeding, then lay them down on the cover to avoid contact with a cool surface.Avoid using mittens—their hands are familiar and soothing, mittens feel strange. And the touch of their skin on your breast boosts oxytocin and your milk.It’s never too late to try breastfeedingIf your birth is more difficult than anticipated, you and your baby have problems or are separated for any reason after the birth it may take you both a little longer to feel closely connected and get breastfeeding going well.If this happens to you, keep your baby with you. Decline offers from others to look after him—ask them to do something practical to help you instead. Relax together with your baby snuggled up against you in Biological Nurturing™ laid-back breastfeeding positions, either lightly dressed or in skin-to-skin contact. Spend as much time as possible with their whole body against yours.Take a warm bath together and focus on just admiring him. Breathe in their special smell, nuzzle and kiss him—some mothers even get an urge to lick their babies. All these can encourage your baby’s natural instinct to feed and help you feel more motherly and that you belong together.How often will my baby need to feed?Babies have tiny tummies so they can’t wait long for food. Even adults rarely go longer than a couple of hours without a drink, snack or meal. Breastmilk is quickly digested so in the early weeks a baby needs to nurse pretty constantly— at least 8–12 times in a 24-hour period, including feeds at night. You release more of the milk-making hormone prolactin during night feeds. Late afternoon/ evening feeds are often closer together too. This ‘cluster feeding’ is normal.As your breasts adjust, they will feel softer. It doesn’t mean your milk supply has dropped. From Day 3 onwards 3–5 poos (at least the size of a 2p coin) per 24- hours are reassuring signs. Frequent feeds are a gradual transition from continuous feeding in the womb. Hunger is a new sensation for your baby so try not to make him wait until he’s too desperate to feed well.Watch for:Mouth movements, including smacking or licking their lips.Sucking on lips, tongue, hands, fingers, toes, toys, or clothing.Rooting, head bobbing or nuzzling against whoever is holding them.Fidgeting or squirming a lot.Fussing.CryingCrying is nature’s emergency siren and a late sign of hunger. It’s designed to summon help quickly. As well as being stressful for you it’s stressful for your baby. Crying raises cortisol levels (which can affect brain development) and increases your baby’s blood pressure. Life will be happier for everyone if you can respond quickly. Once you get to know your baby better you’ll be able to work out what they need most of the time as soon as they start to fuss, long before they need to cry. And thye’ll learn to relax knowing that you’ll look after them.Sucking patternsWatch your baby’s pattern of sucking. They will suck rapidly until milk starts to flow. Once the milk is flowing you’ll see a pattern of suck–swallow–suck–swallow. The frequency of sucks gradually slows as the feed progresses.Once swallowing movements start to trail away and your baby relaxes and gets sleepy, it can be useful to change sides. This can prompt them to take some more.Getting restMany mums feed lying down in bed at night (or in the day) to get more rest. Research shows that keeping your baby close while they are asleep protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) but you should never sleep on a sofa or chair with your baby. Do not share a bed with your baby if any adult in the bed smokes, has drunk alcohol or taken prescription or other drugs. Talk to anLLL Leaderand read our pageSafe Sleep & the Breastfed Babyas you decide how best to manage night-times.VisitorsIt’s OK to set limits on visiting—in fact it’s a really good idea. The first few days are a very special chance for you and your partner to get to know your baby peacefully together. If the birth was difficult it may help to write down your birth story or talk to someone about your feelings to help you come to terms with how it all happened.SupportNo matter how birth goes, with good friends and support, most mothers and babies breastfeed.Calling an LLL Leader or going to yourlocal LLL Groupwhile pregnant means you’ll make breastfeeding friends and have access to support and information right from the start. If you have problems in the first week, or if your baby isn’t feeding well, seek help as soon as possible.As well as your midwife or health visitor, you can contact anLLL Leader.You can also find lots of information on common concerns in the first weeks in our Further Reading section.Written by Rachel O’Leary, Sue Upstone, Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGB.Kimberly Seals Allers’ photos on this site are used under a creative commons license ofBlack Breastfeeding 360°http://mochamanual.com/bb/Further ReadingAdjusting to MotherhoodCaesarean Birth & BreastfeedingPositioning & attachmentComfortable BreastfeedingEngorged Breasts – Avoiding & TreatingIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?My Baby Won’t BreastfeedJaundice in Healthy NewbornsSafe Sleep & the Breastfed BabySleepy Baby – Why & What To DoSuccessfully breastfeeding your premature babyWhat’s the Big Deal With Skin-to-SkinMothering through special careOther websiteswww.birthchoiceuk.comwww.biologicalnurturing.comwww.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendlyBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, LLLI.

"‘Nipple confusion’, ‘nipple preference’ or ‘flow preference’ is often used to describe a change in a baby’s sucking pattern or their willingness to breastfeed following the introduction of a bottle or dummy. A baby may have difficulty latching or staying on the breast, be fussy or reluctant to breastfeed, or be unable to remove milk effectively.Babies are ‘hard-wired’ to breastfeed, so it’s almost always possible to get back to breastfeeding using one or more of the following strategies. Your role is to calm your baby, give them access to the breast, and follow their cues. It’s your baby’s job to feed.Helping baby nurseBreast compressionsNipple ShieldsA deeper latchReturning to workHelping baby nurseClose contact and skin to skinFull body contact with your baby, particularly skin to skin, can trigger your baby’s instinct to breastfeed and help them get a deeper latch.Laid back breastfeedingAs you recline, place your baby upon you so that their whole front is against you and they are supported by your body. Spend as much time like this as you can, skin to skin if possible. For more information, see our article onPositioning and Attachmentfor more information on laid back breastfeeding.Make the breast a “safe space”Handle your baby gently when at the breast to help them associate your breasts with pleasure. Make yourself comfortable, try to take the pressure off breastfeeding and concentrate on bonding and cuddles.Offer the breast earlyWatch for early feeding cues – head bobbing or sucking motions – so that your baby is not too hungry when you offer the breast. Pushing them onto the breast when they are upset may make things worse. Allow your baby to take the breast at their own pace to help them relax and feel in control.A faster flowSwallowing encourages sucking, which will help keep milk flowing. A baby who has become used to a continuous fast flow from a bottle may need help to persist at the breast. You could hand express so that milk starts flowing as soon as your baby latches. Use breast compression to increase milk flow then switch sides to trigger a fresh letdown and encourage them to continue feeding.Breast compressionsCup your hand around your breast, fingers on one side, thumb on the other.When your baby’s swallowing slows, or to increase milk flow, compress your breast firmly. Hold it squeezed whilst they continue to swallow.Release, rotate your hand and repeat. Once you have compressed all areas of the breast, switch sides to stimulate further letdowns. You can switch several times each feed.Nipple ShieldsIf improving attachment and increasing milk flow are not enough, a nipple shield may help provide something firmer for your baby to latch on to. A nipple shield is a thin, silicone teat that can be placed over a mother’s nipple during breastfeeding with holes in the tip to allow milk to flow into the baby’s mouth.A nipple shield can be a useful tool in some situations. It is then regarded as a temporary solution – a transition towards breastfeeding without shields.Nipple shields come in different sizes – a comfortable fit is very important. A good latch is essential with a nipple shield to make sure your baby gets plenty of milk. If your baby latches onto just the tip, they may compress your nipple causing pain.See our article onNipple Shieldsor contact an LLL Leader for more information on using nipple shields effectively.When your baby is sleepyYour baby may take the breast and start sucking when they are asleep or sleepy. It can help to sleep close to your baby so you can easily offer the breast during the night.Other ideasTaking a bath together may encourage your baby to relax, latch and feed well. You’ll need help to do this safely. Motion can help. Offer the breast while carrying your baby in a sling, standing up, walking around, or swaying.A deeper latchOften, an adjustment to the way you position your baby can help them achieve a deeper latch with a wider open mouth. This is especially important as your baby grows heavier and longer. Talk to an LLL Leader for personalised suggestions.Relax comfortably with your breast in its natural position. Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby. Reclining positions make this easier because your body supports your baby.Align your baby ‘nose to nipple’ so their mouth is in the right place to latch when they tip their head back.Pull your baby’s whole body close against yours, from their chest to their hips. It may help to tuck their bottom under your arm.Make sure their head is free to tip back so they can comfortably open their mouth wide.Skin to skin contact can also help your baby tune in to their natural feeding reflexes.For more information, see articlesComfortable BreastfeedingandPositioning & Attachment, and the Natural Breastfeeding video in Further Reading.Bottles and dummiesWait until breastfeeding is established to introduce an artificial teat. Using artificial teats (bottles and dummies) in the early days is more likely to cause your baby to have a shallow latch at the breast, so delay introducing these until breastfeeding is going well.Avoid fast flow from a bottleA baby who gets used to a rapid flow of milk from a bottle without much effort can show a preference for the bottle over time. It is perfectly possible to breastfeed without ever using bottles, but if you do use a bottle ‘pace’ the bottle feeds to slow the flow of milk. SeeBottles and other toolsfor more information on paced bottle feeding.Alternatives to bottlesIf your baby is unable to feed at the breast or needs a supplement, you don’t need to use a bottle. Depending on how much supplement is required, you can use a spoon, syringe, cup or nursing supplementer (this provides extra milk while your baby nurses). SeeBottles and other toolsand alsoNursing Supplementers.Returning to workIf you plan to give your baby a bottle when you return to work, wait until shortly before. Your baby may accept a bottle early on but refuse it later. If your baby will be older than six months a cup can be used instead.Dummies (soothers/pacifiers)Nursing provides comfort for babies which is important for their development. Frequent dummy use, especially in the early weeks, may impact your milk production and your baby’s weight gain.Dummies(unlike some bottles) usually have a short teat which means babies have a partially closed mouth when sucking. If a baby uses this mouth position often, they may not open their mouth wide enough when feeding at the breast.Nursing strike?When an older baby or toddler suddenly refuses to breastfeed it is known as a nursing strike. Sometimes overuse of bottles and teats can contribute to the problem, but often this is due to discomfort while nursing, teething, illness, or an unpleasant experience that your baby associates with nursing. SeeNursing Strikesfor more information.Time and patience may be neededA baby’s behaviour can change suddenly, especially in response to gentle repetition, even if it doesn’t seem to be working at first. With time, most babies will breastfeed again. In the meantime, express your milk to maintain supply.Maintaining milk productionExpress your milk if your baby is not breastfeeding well. Express as often as your baby would normally nurse to maintain your milk production. This will also provide milk for your baby until they return to breastfeeding. For more information seeExpressing your milkEngorged breastsIf your milk is not being removed sufficiently, you may experience engorgement, which makes it harder for your baby to latch on and breastfeed. Gently hand express a little milk before feeding to soften the breast. Reverse pressure softening works by moving fluid away from the nipple area:Press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple. Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola.You can also press with the sides of your fingers: place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be.Seek supportSupport is invaluable when you are experiencing difficulties with breastfeeding. An LLL Leader will have experience with helping mothers and be a sympathetic listener when you need to share your feelings and find a solution. You can also attend your local LLL group meetings.A stressful timeIt can be upsetting if the very activity that soothes a baby – nursing – is a source of frustration or distress. You may feel that there’s nothing you can do. However, with the right encouragement, most babies do breastfeed again. In the meantime, offer lots of carrying and close contact.Try other things to calm your baby:Singing or talking calmly.Holding them against your shoulder or in a sling if they don’t like to be held in a “nursing position”.A peaceful environment.Taking a walk or a bath together.Be kind to yourselfDeal with the challenge one feed at a time.Reduce commitments and chores to give yourself time to concentrate on your baby. If you have a support person, ask them for extra help.Express your milk. This releases oxytocin, which can be calming.Use relaxation techniques such as massages, music, warm baths, low lighting and deep breathing.Further ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

"If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, milk expression by hand is a useful technique to learn. It’s a handy way to relieve engorged breasts. You can also use it to stimulate milk production and provide milk for a baby who is not breastfeeding well or needs more milk.Why hand expression?If you use a pumpPractice helpsHow breasts workBefore you startRelax and get comfortableHow to hand expressStep by stepHow long will hand expressing take?Hand expressing shouldn’t hurtWhy hand expression?Skin-to-skin contact with hand expression encourages the milk ejection reflex (MER) or ‘let-down reflex’.Mothers usually get more milk using hand expression alone or combined with pumping than using just a pump.It requires no special equipment and is always available, even in emergencies.It’s convenient and free.Hand expression is particularly useful if you need to express colostrum during late pregnancy (seeAntenatal Expression of Colostrum) or in the first few days after birth. It makes it easy to save every drop of precious colostrum.If you use a pumpWhatever pump you may use, combiningpumpingwith hand expression can help you express more milk more effectively.Breast massage and hand expression can be used at the beginning to get your milk flowing.Breast massage while pumping increases the amount of milk you can express.Continuing to hand express can release milk remaining, evenafter the pump flow has stopped.And if your pump breaks down, or there is no electricity, youalways have your hands.Practice helpsHand expression is simple to learn and gets easier with practice. You may receive information and a demonstration of hand expression from your midwife. Developing your own routine, starting with relaxation techniques and stimulating milk flow, makes it easier too.How breasts workWhen milk is removed more often, your breasts feel soft and comfortable and produce milk faster. When milk is removed infrequently, your breasts may feel full but produce milk more slowly. Frequent milk removal is the key to maintaining milk production whether you are breastfeeding or expressing. Expressing stimulates your breasts—though not as effectively as a baby—to make and release milk.For more information onhow milk production works, click here.Before you startWash your hands. Have a suitable clean container available to collect your milk: colostrum can be expressed into a small (5ml) container or even onto a teaspoon for immediate feeding. Once milk production has increased milk may spray in several directions so a bowl, wide mouthed container or a bottle with a funnel might be more practical.Relax and get comfortableMilk tends to flow better when you are feeling comfortable, relaxed and warm. Tension or anxiety inhibits milk flow. Relaxation techniques can help increase the amount of milk you can express. The sound of running water may help, or you could practise in the bath or shower.Seek privacy; try the breathing exercises you learnt for use during labour; visualise flowing milk. Have your baby nearby, or think of him. Use photos or recordings of your baby and smell his clothing. All these will help stimulate milk flow. Take a few deep breaths, drop your shoulders and release tension with each exhalation. Bending forward with your breasts suspended means gravity can help milk flow.How to hand expressOne basic approachStart by encouraging milk flow in both breasts.Then hand express from each breast until milk flow slows right down. If you need to increase milk production, continue expressing for a couple of minutes after milk flow has stopped.Repeat these two steps at least twice more. You will find milk flow slows or stops sooner each time you repeat.Most mothers adapt the above approach to suit themselves, so experiment to find what works best for you.Step by stepEncouraging milk flowStimulating your milk ejection reflex (MER or ‘let-down’) is the key to expressing. It can take a few minutes. You may see drops of colostrum or breastmilk, or even experience a tingling sensation, but many mothers don’t see any milk until they start actually expressing. Experiment with the following suggestions to find out what works best for you.Massage your breast starting at the top, using a firm circular pressure on one spot. After a few seconds, lift up your fingers to move to the next area on the breast. Spiral around the breast towards the areola and nipple.Stroke your breast from the top of the breast to the areola and nipple. Light stroking with fingers is one option, or use a soft item with a light tickle-like stroke. Continue this stroking motion from the chest wall to the nipple around the whole breast.Shake your breast gently while leaning forward so gravity can help your milk flow.Hand positionYou can use either or both hands on one breast, or express both breasts at the same time. Hold your hand in the shape of a letter ‘C’, with your thumb and forefinger behind the base of your nipple, feeling for the change in texture of your breast. Move you fingers closer to, or away from your nipple to find the best place for you.To expressStart with the pad of your thumb at the top of your breast, and your finger pads below.Support your breast, then press the breast towards the chest wall to put pressure on the milk ducts.Now compress the breast between your fingers and thumb to move the milk forward towards your nipple.Release and repeat rhythmically: press—compress—relax (like a baby breastfeeding) until milk flow stopsThen rotate your hand around the breast a little and repeat. Do this for each section of your breast until it feels soft and comfortable. Keep your fingers and thumb opposite one another as you rotate.Remember that when a baby breastfeeds, milk doesn’t flow immediately, so it’s normal for it to take a little time for milk to start flowing when you express. Switch back and forth between breasts as the flow slows to encourage further MERs.This videohas a good demonstration of hand expression of breastmilkHow long will hand expressing take?Allow plenty of time at first: the whole process may take 20 or 30 minutes, but you can always stop and start again later if you need to. Frequent short sessions are usually more effective than infrequent, longer expressing sessions.Switching between breasts several times as milk flow slows can help trigger further milk ejection reflexes. The more MERs you stimulate, the more milk you will be able to express and make.Hand expression shouldn’t hurtSqueezing, pulling and sliding fingers along the skin can cause discomfort, bruising and skin burns. Pain or discomfort inhibit the MER and are signs that something needs adjusting. If your breast feels engorged or tender try warm moist heat immediately before expressing. Start expressing from the most comfortable areas.Removing milk from areas around a blocked duct can reduce the discomfort, making it easier to express from the tender area later.Written by Sue Upstone, Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGB.Further ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. LLLI.

"Breastfeeding is intended to be comfortable and enjoyable—so experiencing painful or sore nipples is a clear sign that something isn’t quite right. The information should help you identify the most likely cause of your discomfort and take steps to resolve it.Whilst there are a number of causes of nipple pain, by far the most common is poor attachment at the breast. Almost always thefirst step is to try to improve your baby’s latch-on. Experiment with different ways of holding your baby and also try letting your baby take the lead: sitting in a semi-reclined position and placing your baby on your front triggers his instinctive feeding reflexes (laid-back breastfeeding).If improving attachment brings no relief then you may need to consider other causes.An LLL Leader can tell you more about specific causes and treatments, and further information can be found in our other pages linked below.You can getskilled help from an LLL Leaderonline, by calling your local Leader or our national helpline, or through one of our breastfeeding support groups. Getting support and encouragement from other breastfeeding mothers in yourlocal LLL Groupmay be a real help. The sooner you seek help, the easier it usually is to resolve the problem.Pain on latch-on that improves as milk starts flowing, caused by:Poor latch-on– Try adjusting how you hold your baby at the breast.  SeeComfortable Breastfeedingand seek support from anLLL Leader.Holding your breast between your index and middle fingers while latching on, too close to the nipple– Try supporting your breast between your thumb and fingers, keeping your fingers well back from the areola. Sometimes shaping your breast slightly to match the oval of your baby’s mouth can help. Or try laid-back breastfeeding, which reduces the need to hold your baby, leaving you with both hands free to shape your breast and help him latch.Slow let-down of milk– At the start of a feed use gentle massage, relaxation, hand expression and breast compression to get milk flowing before or as your baby latches on.Pain throughout feed, stops when baby comes off, caused by:Baby not attaching deeply enough so nipple rubs on baby’s tongue or roof of baby’s mouth– Adjust how you hold your baby at the breast and seek further help fromComfortable Breastfeedingand/or from anLLL Leader.Baby is using tongue incorrectly having become used to bottle teat or dummy –Avoid using teats or dummies. SeeNipple Confusion?andDummies and BreastfeedingBaby is using his tongue incorrectly possibly due to a tongue-tie (ankyloglossia)– Seek skilled breastfeeding help to assess your baby for tongue-tie. Ask for a referral for assessment and treatment if necessary.Pain as baby comes off, caused by:Suction not broken when taking baby off– put a clean finger between your baby’s gums to break the suction if you need to remove him from the breast.OK at first, painful as feed progresses.Attachment has slipped during feed perhaps because either your breast or your baby has dropped into a lower position– Sit or lie comfortably with your body and arms supported. Keep your baby’s whole body against yours. If you recline, some or all of his weight can be supported by your body so your arms aren’t holding his entire weight throughout the feed. Let your breast rest at its natural level and bring your baby to breast, not breast to baby.  Experiment with different breastfeeding positions and seek further help from an LLL Leader.Stabbing pains in the breast throughout feed and afterwards.Vasospasm caused by baby not attaching deeply enough leading to constriction of blood vessels. Or referred pain due to poor positioning and attachment –Adjust how you hold your baby at the breast and seek further help fromComfortable Breastfeedingand from anLLL Leader. If you continue to have vasospasms even after latch-on is improved, see Raynaud’s phenomenon below.Raynaud’s phenomenon. This is where blood vessels narrow, associated with cold– Eliminate other causes first, especially if breastfeeding has always been painful or your nipples are flattened or wedge-shaped after feeds. Seek medical assessment. Keep warm and avoid nicotine and caffeine, which can be triggers.ThrushWhen baby is around 3 months or older.Shallow latch because baby has grown and positioning has not been adjusted– Adjust how you hold your baby so he can latch more deeply onto the breast. Seek further help if needed.Teething– Offer your baby something cold to chew on before breastfeeds.Baby bites to get your full attention or clamps down as he releases the breast at the end of a feed– Give your baby your full attention while nursing and have a finger ready to break suction at end of feed if needed.Skin of nipple reacting to food particles present in baby’s mouth– Rinse baby’s mouth with water before nursing; avoid offering that particular food for a while.Hormonal changes associated withpregnancyor your period can increase nipple sensitivity– Hand express to get milk flowing and vary nursing positions. A toddler may be willing to nurse for shorter times until the discomfort decreases.Nipple shaped normally but pain experienced, commonly at the tip of the nipple.Baby not attaching deeply enough– Adjust how you hold your baby at the breast. Seek further help fromComfortable Breastfeedingand/or from anLLL Leader.Breastpump suction too high or pump flange poor fit– Reduce suction or vacuum to a comfortable level.  Moisten the flange of the breastpump. Centre your nipple in the flange and/or try a different sized flange. Use breast massage andhand expressionto encourage milk to flow. Lubricate your nipples and areolae with purified lanolin suitable for breastfeeding mothers.Nipple not so prominent—baby having difficulty latching on.Engorgement– Breastfeed frequently—watch for early breastfeeding cues. Take steps to relieveengorgementand soften the breast. Try reverse pressure softening—gently pushing swelling backwards away from the areola using fingertips. Gentle massage orhand expressioncan also help.Flat/inverted nipple– see page onInverted NipplesNipple looks white and misshapen or wedge shaped when baby comes off; pain during and after feeds.Vasospasm caused by baby not attaching deeply enough causing constriction of blood vessels– Adjust how you hold your baby at the breast and seek further help fromComfortable Breastfeedingand/or from anLLL Leader.

"Engorged breasts are painful. They feel heavy, hard, warm and sensitive —as if they are ready to burst!  As well as being painful, engorgement can lead to other breastfeeding problems if not treated. Being able to recognise engorgement will help you to treat it promptly, avoiding complications.Most mothers experience some engorgement in the first weeks after birth. With changing hormone levels, your breasts swell and enlarge as milk production increases. It may seem as though they are filling up with milk, but engorgement is more than milk storage. Your body directs extra blood and fluids to your breasts to boost milk production. This causes congestion and swelling which will decrease as your body adjusts.Minimizing early engorgementTreat engorgement to…When to treat engorgementAfter the first few weeksCauses of engorgementTreating engorgmentBe sure your baby is sucking effectivelyReverse pressure softeningKeep comfortableWatch out for signs of mastitisMinimizing early engorgementNew mothers vary in how engorged their breasts become in the weeks after birth; some experience little engorgement, others describe their breasts as feeling like watermelons!Try these suggestionsBreastfeed your baby frequently from birth: at least 8–12 times in 24 hours. Keeping your baby close makes it easier to nurse every hour or two.Ifyour baby is sleepy, perhaps from a medicated birth, you may need to wake him and encourage him to nurse.Aim to be comfortable while  breastfeeding, and learn how to get your baby latched on well.If your newborn is unable to breastfeed,hand expressfrequentlyuntil your milk‘comes in’, thencombine with usinga hospital-gradeelectricbreastpumptohelp establish your milkproduction and relieveengorgement. Your milkcan be given to yourbaby until he is ableto nurse.Treat engorgement to…Make breastfeeding easierEven if you feel as though you have lots of milk, engorgement can make it harder for your baby to latch on to your breast and feed well. A poor latch-on can give you sore nipples. Your baby may also have trouble coping with the flow of milk from engorged breasts.Protect milk productionWhen milk isn’t removed from your breasts, you will produce less milk. Treating engorgement gives your baby more milk now and helps protect milk production for when your baby is older.Avoidblocked ducts or mastitisEngorgement can result in blocked ducts leading to mastitis.When to treatTake action to relieve engorgement if your breasts feel firm, hard, shiny or lumpy. When milk is removed, blood circulation improves and swelling reduces. Use the suggestions below to reduce swelling and keep your milk flowing. Many mothers have a slight temperature when their breasts are engorged. Temperatures under 38.4ºC are not usually associated with infection. Keep your baby close and continue breastfeeding.Engorgement after the first weeksTreat as outlined below while working out the cause so you can prevent it happening again.Common causes of engorgement are:A missed feed or expressing session.This can easily happen during holidays and festivities or when visitors arrive. Encourage your baby to feed more often, or express more frequently if you’re apart from your baby.Feeding a baby on a scheduleRecent research has revealed that mothers vary in how much milk their breasts can store without becoming uncomfortable. Mothers following routines often suffer from engorgement, mastitis and low milk production because their breasts are not drained often enough.Expressing milk.Some books advise expressing to keep milk production one step ahead of a baby’s needs. However, making more milk than your baby needs can increase your risk of engorgement and mastitis, especially if you go for several hours without feeding or expressing.A baby who is unable or unwilling to nurse well for any reasonExpressing milk frequently until your baby can nurse well will help you maintain milk production and avoid blocked ducts or mastitis.Weaning from the breast too quicklyIf you experience engorgement duringweaning, you may need to slow down the process. This will give your breasts time to adjust to the reduced demand for milk. If breastfeeding more often is not an option, try expressing just enough milk to relieve the fullness by hand or pump.Treating engorgementReduce swelling and keep milk flowing:Aim to breastfeed every 1½ to 2 hours during the day, and at night every 2–3 hours from the start of one feed to the start of the next. Let your baby finish on the first breast before switching to the secondAvoid using bottles or dummies. If a supplement is needed try using a spoon, flexible feeding cup or syringe.Between feeds, apply ice for 15–20 minutes at a time between feeds to reduce swelling. Use an ice pack, crushed ice in plastic bags or bags of frozen vegetables (that can be refrozen several times before being thrown away). Wrap them in a lightweight towel to protect your skin.Just before feeding, apply moist warmth to your breasts for up to two minutes to help milk flow. Try a warm wet towel, warm shower or immersing breasts in a bowl of warm water.  Then, express to comfort if your baby isn’t ready to feed.Use gentle massage from the chest wall toward thenipple area in a circular motion.Be sure your baby is sucking effectively:Position your baby with his chest and tummy in full contact with your body. With his cheek in close contact with your breast, your baby can easily tip back his head to latch on. This way he’ll take a large mouthful of breast. Listen for swallowing as he feeds.If your baby is finding it hard to latch on – when your baby bobs his head and licks the nipple, he naturally makes it easier to latch on.For more information ongetting your baby positioned and attached comfortably see here.Reverse pressure softeningworks by moving fluid away from the nipple area.Press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple. Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola.You can also press with the sides of fingers. Place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be.If this isn’t enough, gently hand express a little milk before feeding to soften the areola. If you choose to use a breastpump, set it to minimum suction.Keep comfortable:Ask your midwife or GP to recommend an over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medication suitable for breastfeeding mothers to relieve pain and swelling.A well-fitting, supportive bra may help. Avoid bras (and underwires) that are tight or put pressure on specific areas of the breast.Cold, raw cabbage leaves worn inside a bra can be soothing.  Change when they become wilted or after about 2 hours. Use only until swelling goes down as long-term use may reduce milk supply. Stop use if a skin rash or other signs of allergy appear.Watch out for symptoms of mastitis:Inflamed, hot, red or darkened localised areas of your breast, depending on your skin tone. Changes in breast appearance may be harder to spot in darker skin. You may still have engorged breasts without a noticeable red or darkened area.Temperature over 38.4ºC or flu-like symptoms.Weaning can make a breast infection worse so continue to breastfeed frequently especially on the affected side and treat as for engorgement. Rest and drink fluids. If fever persists, continue breastfeeding and check with your GP as you may need antibiotics. More information onmastitis.Engorgement should improve within a day or two. If not, contact an LLL Leader for further suggestions. You may need to improve your baby’s breastfeeding technique or find ways to reduce your milk supply. These are not difficult problems to solve, especially if treated promptly.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone & mothers of La Leche League Great BritainFurther ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

"“In most parts of the world… babies sleep close to their mothers, as they have through most of history.” –The Womanly Art of  BreastfeedingA baby is born expecting to stay in close contact with his mother night and day, in order to keep safe, warm and well-fed.It is perfectly normal for babies—especially breastfed babies—to wake and feed at night throughout at least the first year. Bedsharing when breastfeeding is a traditional way of caring for a baby at night—breastfeeding at night can be a whole lot easier when you take your baby into bed with you and feed lying down.Breastfeeding mothers who bedshare get more sleep than bottlefeeding mothers1and breastfeed for longer.2Alternatively, co-sleeping may give your baby the closeness he craves and make breastfeeding easier without sharing the same sleep surface as you.It is possible to bedshare with twins, but co-sleeping rather than bedsharing is recommended if they were premature or low birth-weight.Infant sleep–what are the risks?The Safe Sleep SevenMeeting Everyone’s NeedsSleep SafelyEasy NightsInfant sleep–what are the risks?AccidentsBabies sleep in a variety of places at different times. Wherever a baby sleeps an accidental injury is possible. A baby could become wedged between furniture or against a parent’s body, fall off the sleep surface or risk suffocation or strangulation by pillows, cords or blankets.Anything that reduces your alertness or ability to respond to your baby, such as alcohol, drugs or certain medications, can pose a risk and may impair your judgement.Breastfed babies orient themselves near their mother’s breast in bed. Research3shows that mothers who bedshare with their breastfed babies adopt a naturally protective position, making smothering unlikely. This has been referred to as the ‘cuddle curl’ position.SIDSSudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or cot death, is a sudden unexpected infant death (usually occurring during sleep) that can’t be explained by a medical condition, infection, intentional harm, or accidental causes.What makes a baby vulnerableSIDS can happen in any sleep situation, but research has shown that SIDS only happens to baby who are vulnerable. We don’t know exactly which factors cause vulnerability, but they include4:baby being less than four months oldprenatal exposure to harmful chemicals including smoke and alcoholpreterm or low brith weight baby (under 2.5kg).SIDs risk factorsThe following factors increase the risk of SIDS for a vulnerable baby, wherever they sleep5.Exposure to smokecan affect a baby’s ability to rouse from sleep. The risk is related to how much exposure a baby has. It is always a good idea to reduce your baby’s exposure to smoke wherever they sleep, butif you are a smoker you should not share a sleep surface with your baby. Smoking is the biggest SIDS risk.Placing a baby on his frontto sleep may affect his ability to arouse and to breathe. ‘Back to Sleep’ campaigns have reduced SIDS in many Western countries. Bedsharing breastfeeding mothers often nurse in a side-lying position—when a baby comes off the breast they naturally rolls onto their back. A baby who can roll back and forth can choose his own sleep position.Being unattended.During all sleep (daytime and nightime), a baby’s risk of SIDS is lower if they are in the same room as you.Formula-feeding(including combi-feeding) imposes a statistically significant higher risk of SIDS.The Safe Sleep Seven6Breastfeeding mothers who meet the criteria below are statistically low risk and can bedshare with confidence.You need to be:A non-smokerSober (no drugs, alcohol, or medications that could make you drowsy)BreastfeedingYour baby needs to be:Healthy and full term (with a birth weight above 2.5kg)Sleeping on their back when they are not breastfeedingUnswaddled and lightly dressedYou both need to be:On a safe surface.Neversleep with your baby on a sofa or armchair.Make an informed decisionUse the information above along with our checklist below to evaluate your baby’s different sleeping places and your own family circumstances, to reduce the risk of an accident or SIDS wherever you and your baby sleep.Meeting Everyone’s NeedsIf you are struggling to reconcile your own sleep needs with those of your baby, then talking with an LLL Leader may be helpful. At anLLL meetingyou can find out how other families meet the sleep needs of their sleep needs in different ways and at different stages.Find local supporthere.  Call our helpline:0345 120 2918Photo courtesy: Rosie RoweCo-sleeping or bedsharing?7Bedsharing:adults and infants sharing the same surface for sleep.Co-sleeping:parents and infants sleeping in close proximity, but not necessarily on the same surface eg in a bedside cot or a sidecar cot attached to the bed.Some studies combine sofa sleeping with bedsharing, making it more difficult to separate the risk factors for each scenario. SeeFurther Readingfor more details, or for more information on these definitions, seehere.Sleep safelySleep tipsDo✔ Place your baby to sleep on their back.✔ Keep your sleeping baby close day and night, not in a room alone.✔ Avoid exposing your baby to cigarette smoke at any time as this increases the risk of SIDS.✔ Place your baby with his feet to the foot of any cot, crib or pram.✔ Sleep facing your baby in bed (your thigh should prevent him slipping under the covers).✔ Check your baby’s sleeping place for hazards:Choose a firm, flat, clean, well-fitting mattress and cover with a close-fitting sheet.Check for gaps that they might get trapped in..Ensure they can’t fall out.Choose clothes without strings or ties that could cause strangulation.✔ Check your baby does not get too hot or too cold whilst sleeping. In hot weather, open a window or use a fan.✔ Keep pets out of your baby’s bed.NEVER leave your sleeping baby:✘ Near a fire or radiator, or in full sun.✘ Wearing warm outdoor clothing when indoors.NEVER sleep with your baby:✘ On a sofa or armchair.✘ If he is swaddled.Bedsharing tipsWhen bedsharing do✔ Sleep facing your baby in bed (your thigh should prevent them slipping under the covers).✔ Keep pillows and your covers away from your baby.✔ Ensure anyone in the bed knows your baby is there.✔ Keep an adult between any older children and your baby in bed.Don’t bedshare✘ If any person in the bed is a smoker (even if they never smoke in bed).✘ On a soft mattress. It isn’t known whether memory foam mattresses are a problem.✘ If any person in the bed has drunk alcohol, taken drugs (legal or illegal) that could make them extra sleepy, or is too exhausted to be aware of your baby.✘ If any person in the bed has an illness or condition that affects their awareness of your baby.Once you can safely and comfortably feed your baby while lying down, you’ve elimated much of the work of mothering for eight of the 24 hours in a day.Easy NightsYou may find that different sleeping arrangements work at different times. Being inventive and focusing on how you and your family can get the most sleeptonightcan help. Some of these ideas may work for you, but because only you know your own circumstances, always keep safety in mind.Extra space can help. Try:• Using a cot designed for co-sleeping.• Pushing your baby’s cot right up to your bed. Lower the side and raise the base for easy access at night; secure the cot to your bed.• Using a larger bed.• Putting a single bed at the side for your partner, if you have one, to sleep on—keep your baby away from the gap in the mattresses.Avoid tumbles by:• Using a mesh guard rail – but make sure there is no gap between the rail and the bed.• Taking the legs off the bed or putting the mattress on the floor.Keep comfortable by:• Wearing a cardigan to keep your arms warm.• Dressing your baby in light clothes to avoid overheating.• Putting an extra thick nappy on your baby to avoid unnecessary changes in the night.• Keeping a towel handy in case of damp nappies or leaking milk.Learn to feed lying down by:• Practising in the daytime!• Keeping a low light on.• Going to aLa Leche League meetingand learning from other mothers.• Watching our video on breastfeeding while lying on your side:These safety tips apply to healthy full-term breastfed infants. Preterm and low birth weight babies are more vulnerable. If your baby seems unwell, seek medical advice promptly. Remember that safety tips can help reduce the risk of SIDS and accidents wherever your baby sleeps, but cannot eliminate the risk altogether.Written by Sue Cardus, Karen Butler, Sue Upstone, Bronwyn Davies & mothers of La Leche League GB.Further ReadingSweet Sleep: Nighttime & Naptime Strategies for the Breastfeeding FamilyWiessinger, West, Smith, Pitman, LLLI.

Swimming pool water is chlorinated for the purpose of killing bacteria and breastmilk is probably one of the things swimmers need to least worry about.Fears that a baby will vomit in the poolA baby who has just been breastfed is no more likely to vomit or bring up milk than a baby who had a formula feed.  If a mother knows her baby is prone to copious posseting then she will be aware of the possible problems.  It seems unlikely thatanyonewould want their child to vomit in a pool!It is unhygienic for the babyIt is possible a baby will ingest a small amount of pool water, but probably a lot less than they will when they are actually swimming.  A baby’s mouth forms a seal around the breast – if a tiny amount of water is swallowed it will be no more harmful than that swallowed at other times.No eating rule should apply to allThis rule was intended to apply to things such as solid food, tea, coffee, fizzy drinks and such like.  Breastmilk is not really comparable to these, and will not contaminate the pool in the way other foodstuffs would.  Breastmilk is not just a food for a baby but also a way of comforting them.  Babies can’t plan when they need to nurse so it is impossible to expect them to eat beforehand or wait until afterwards in the same way that adults and older children can.Why can’t the mother get out of the pool?A mother will often be at the pool with an older child.  It is impractical to take the child out and certainly not acceptable to leave another child in the pool on their own.  A few minutes at the breast may well be enough to comfort the baby and for everyone to carry on without disruption.The Indecency ArgumentA mother nursing her child is not necessarily showing anymore flesh, and most likely a lot less, than many other people in the pool and this includes men as well as women!Equality Act 2010It is entirely legal to breastfeed in public places anywhere in the UK. According to the Equality Act of 2010, treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding a child of any age is considered sex discrimination. This applies to any business or premise providing services to the public, including public institutions, associations and higher education bodies. Service providers dealing directly with the public must not discriminate, harass or victimise a woman because she is breastfeeding. Discrimination includes refusing to provide a service, providing a lower standard of service or providing a service on different terms.It is possible that individual business employees, owners or managers may not be aware of these regulations and may tell a woman that she cannot breastfeed on the business premises. If this happens, the mother can challenge their request. If still asked to stop breastfeeding or leave the premises, a woman can contact the Government Equalities Office. A solicitor can advise on whether a claim can be brought for discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act. In previous cases where women have been asked to stop breastfeeding in the pool, the authorities concerned have eventually reversed their decision and stated that women are entitled to breastfeed if they wish to.Report into Breastfeeding at Municipal PoolsIn August 2002 a report was prepared on behalf of the Breastfeeding Action Committee of Edmonton (Canada).  This looked at complaints made about women who breastfed at public pools and addressed all the issues raised.  You can read ithere.Written by Anna Burbidge.

These include:when a baby can’t breastfeedto make more milka return to paid workseparationchoiceWhen a baby can’t breastfeedBabies and parents have many instincts for breastfeeding, but it is still a learned skill that can take time and practice. When babies won’t breastfeed, it is usually because they can’t. This could be for many reasons, for example:they are pretermthey are unwellthey have a tongue tiethey are sleepy as a result of birth medicationsthey had a difficult birthit is taking time to learn how to breastfeedExpressing milk when your baby cannot nurse – or nurse effectively – protects your milk supply and provides milk to feed them. Breastmilk is especially important for babies who are unwell and/orpretermas it helps protect against illness and infections, and is ideal for a baby’s sensitive and immature digestive system.Expressing milk is often a short-term solution. However, some mothers may find themselves exclusively expressing breast milk (‘exclusively pumping‘) long-term when their baby is ill or has medical difficulties.Making more milkOnce your baby is born,milk productionworks on a supply and demand basis: the more milk you remove, the more milk you are likely to make. The first two weeks are very important. If not enough milk is removed early on, it may affect your long-term supply, and your baby may not gain weight as expected.Some parents have underlying conditions that are risk factors for low milk supply. However, it is usually possible tomake more milk. The main way to do this is by removing milk frequently, and for some parents this will include expressing.A return to paid workThere are many ways to combineworking and breastfeeding. It is not always necessary to express milk when returning to work. It may depend on:the age of your babythe length of time you are apartyour willingness – and ability – to express; pumping is not effective for everyone, although there are ways to improve this.your baby’s willingness to take your milk when you aren’t thereMany mothers express initially for reassurance and comfort, and to avoidblocked ducts and mastitis. However, you may find that your body quickly adjusts to a new breastfeeding pattern and you no longer need or want to express.SeparationYou and your baby may need to be apart. This may be for illness or health reasons, an appointment or event, or a night away.Your baby has an intense need for your presence as well as your milk, and separation can be hard for both of you. It may be possible to take your baby with you – young babies are very portable and often enjoy being out and about.ChoiceSome mothers choose to express milk some or all of the time. You might want – or feel pressured – to let a partner or other family member feed your baby. Some parents choose to exclusively pump because they don’t enjoy breastfeeding, but want their baby to have the benefits of their milk.There are many wayspartners and familycan bond and be involved with a baby. Expressing milk takes time and energy.Any breastmilk is good; however there are differences between a baby feeding at the breast anddrinking breastmilk by a different method, for example from a cup or bottle.Expressing MilkWhat kind of pump do I need?Pumps are available to hire and to buy. The pump you use depends on your reason(s) for expressing and your personal preference. We all respond differently to pumps and have different needs.Single electric pumpsandmanualpumps are best suited tooccasional expressing, for example, short term separation or a return to work. They can also be used toexpress ‘to comfort’any time your breast feels very full and your baby doesn’t want to feed.Double electric pumpsexpress milk from both breasts at once, which often saves time. It is also said that they tend to stimulate more milk production. They are available aspersonal usepumps and‘hospital grade’pumps.Hospital grade pumpsare very powerful and are intended to be used by more than one person multiple times a day. They are usually hired. Hospital grade pumps are recommended when you areexclusivelyexpressing, expressingvery frequently, or trying to increase your supply. Parents might start with a hospital grade and then switch to a personal use pump once their supply is established and if they need to keep expressing.Silicone pumpstend to be best suited tooccasionaluse. Some mothers have found them helpful to relieve blocked ducts. (Note: When attached to the breast, a silicone pump is not just a device for collecting dripping milk – it creates a vacuum stimulating a ‘letdown’. If this is not your planned use, it can createsupply issues.)Hands-free pumpscome as single or double electric pumps. They can be handy for mums who want to pump on the go, or pump and multitask. Hands-free pumps have small motors and are possibly best suited to occasional pumping. You can buy or make a hands-free bra for a pump to fit in to.Image Copyright ©Types of Pump (image above)A. Manual breast pumpB. Single electric pumpC. Double electric pumpIt is also possible to express without any equipment.Hand expressingis a great skill to learn for all ages and stages! It can take a little practice, but it can quickly become second nature:It is free and can be done any time, anywhere!It is theperfect choice for the early dayswhen you are producing colostrum (you cancollect–or ‘harvest’–colostrumbefore your baby is born).You can practiseantenatallyand become familiar with your breasts before your baby arrives.Getting ‘hands-on’ during a pumping session can increase milk output. SeeExpressing Tips.What else do I need to know about pumps?Pump fitPumps are often sold in a standard size, however pumppartscome in different sizes. The funnel-shaped piece that touches your breast is usually called aflange. The tubed-shaped bit that the nipple goes into is sometimes called thenipple tunnel.If pumping is comfortable with good milk flow, you probably have a good fit. However, if pumping ispainfulor causing swelling and/or rubbing, you may need abigger or smaller flange. Sometimes a different flange size is needed for each breast. A poor fit can also reduce milk flow.1The nipple should have enough room to slide in and out during pumping, without rubbing. The areola (darker area around the nipples) may move slightly with it, but it shouldn’t be drawn into the nipple tunnel. After pumping, the nipple will almost certainly be bigger, but shouldn’t seem darker or swollen.2Image Copyright ©Pump Flange Sizes (image above)A. Milk expressionB. Flange is too bigC. Flange fitsD. Flange is too smallSuction strength and cycle speedElectric pumps often come with a range of settings. There will be settings forsuction strengthand settings forcycle speed.A pump is trying to mimic a breastfeeding baby. When a baby nurses, they do a fast, light suck to trigger a letdown. Once the milk lets down, the sucking slows and they swallow more.You mightbegin by using a low suction, high speed settingand once your milk starts flowing,switching to a higher suction, lower speed setting.Exactly how high or low depends on how it feels and if it is removing milk well.Expressing should be comfortable,and a pump provides most milk when it is set at the upper end of fully comfortable.3Painful pumping may impact milk flow, damage your nipples, and is unlikely to make you feel like doing it!How often and when should I express?If your baby can’t breastfeed yet, aim to express8–10 times in a 24-hour period, including at least once at night. These do not need to be at regular time intervals, but avoid stretches longer than 5 or 6 hours. Once your supply is well established, you may find that you can get by with fewer sessions.4If you are trying tomake more milk, express after or between feeds. How often depends on how much more milk your baby needs and how feeding at the breast is going.If you arereturning to paid work,how often you express will depend on a number of things. Some parents look at how often they feed on average in a 24-hour period and work out how many feeds they will typically have when they are with their child, so express the same number of times when separated to maintain this daily average.If you are stockpiling milk for short-termseparationor in the run up to a return to work, express once or twice a day after or between feeds. If your baby typically feeds from one breast, you could express from the other side while they feed. The amounts may seem small, but they quickly build up!Some mothers try ‘power pumping’ as a short-term strategy toincrease their milk supply, or when they are struggling to fit pumping into their daytime routine. This approach involves expressing very frequently for short periods, stopping and starting as many times as possible – it is said to mimic cluster feeding.How long should I express for?Just like breastfeeding, expressing milk is not a ‘one-size-fits-all’. Observe your milk flow, notice how your breasts feel and find what works for you.If you are using a single pump, this usually takes about 20–30 minutes for both breasts. You might try switching sides when the milk flow slows, usually every 5–7 minutes.5Double pumps save time. A double-pumping session that replaces what would have been nursing will probably last no more than 15 minutes. However, it is more important to pay attention to your breasts than the clock.6How much milk will I express?How much we can express at any one time depends on lots of different things. If you’ve never used a pump before, it might be helpful to think of the first pumping sessions as practice.7Expect small amounts in the early days. This will be drops for some and as much as a teaspoon for others. Many parents think of it as ‘putting in their order’ for more milk later.8If you are breastfeeding full-time, expect to express around 15–60ml (0.5–2 fl oz) in total from both breasts per pumping session.9If you are exclusively pumping, consider the overall volume in 24 hours. Full milk production is about 750–900 ml (25–30 fl oz) per baby. Milk production reaches its peak at about five weeks and stays relatively stable until around six months.10Once milk production peaks, a typical feed is about 60–120ml (2–4 fl oz).11We all respond differently to pumps. How much you can express is not always a reliable or accurate sign of how much milk is there. It’s important to remember that a baby who is nursing effectively will get more milk than a pump.Expressing tipsBeforeexpressing:Wash your hands and get comfortablePut something warm on your breasts, such as a warm flannelGentlymassage your breastsUse any objects or techniques that help you to feel calm and relaxed. This might be a photo of your baby, an item of their clothing, a favourite warm drink or snack, music or visualisations.Whileexpressing:Try ‘hands-on pumping’. This is said to produce better results than relying on a pump alone12Usebreast compressionto increase milk flowTake a break midway and gently massage the breasts to help increase the amount of milk.13Hand express from both breasts after you have finished pumping.Try nursing your baby on one side and expressing on the other, or expressing from both sides at the same time, to encourage more letdownsAfterexpressing:Hand-express for a minute or two to help increase output and supply.Cleaning pump partsThere is not complete agreement about cleaning pumping equipment. Some public/advisory bodies (including NHS England) recommend sterilising equipment after every feed.Others recommend washing pump parts thoroughly after every feed and sterilising once a day.Some advisory bodies and breastfeeding organisations state that pump parts do not need to be sterilised, and that washing in hot soapy water is enough if your baby is healthy and full term.Day-to-day milk handlingThere is very little research on the day-to-day problems of milk handling, so guidelines often err on the side of caution.Fresh human milk kills almost all bacteria, viruses and fungi that it comes in contact with.14Mothers who are exclusively expressing, or expressing frequently, sometimes put the whole pumping kit (flanges attached) in a clean container in the fridge until the next expressing session and clean everything at the end of the day.Breastmilk can be safely stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours (see below). Some parents apply the same timeframe to their pump and pump parts, and express multiple times within a 4 hour period before cleaning everything.One quick method of sterilising is to use a sterilising fluid that you change every 24 hours. Submerge pump parts in the solution after washing them each time.15Washing and dryingEnsure hands and pump area are clean.You may like to use a separate basin and separate utensils for cleaning pump parts and equipment rather than the sink.Clean with hot soapy water and rinse separately with clean water.Some pump equipment is also dishwasher-safe.Air dry or dry with paper towels.Clean pump dials and switches with a disinfectant spray or wipe.Store dry pump equipment in a clean container.If you are expressing milk for asick or premature baby, good hygiene is vital andsterilising is essential.Storing MilkHow long can I store milk for?There isn’t complete agreement about milk storage.Wherever you are storing milk, the fresher it is, the better.Good hygiene is important — clean hands, clean pump parts, clean storage.For healthy, full term babies16:Room temperatureIdeally, use within4 hours.Depending on room temperature and how clean storage conditions are, up to6–8 hoursmay be safe.Frozen milk that has thawed and kept at room temperature should be used within4 hours.FridgeIdeally, use within4 days.When conditions are very clean,5–8 daysmay be acceptable.Store milk in the back of the fridge rather than in the door.Frozen milk that has thawed in the fridge should be used within24 hours.FreezerIdeally, use within6 months.Can be stored for up to12 months.Store at the back of the freezer, away from the door where temperatures may fluctuate.Insulated bagUse within24 hours.Milkleft overafter a feed should be used within1–2 hoursas it mixes with a baby’s saliva, although it may be safe to put it in a fridge for up to 4 hours.17Forpremature or sick babies, consult with hospital staff and follow hospital guidelines.Combining expressed milkWhen combining milk expressed at different times, mix cold with cold:Chill newly expressed milk before adding it to an existing container.You can add refrigerated milk to frozen as long as there is less refrigerated milk than frozen.Use within the time limit of the oldest expressed milk.What can I store milk in?You can store milk in any clean container, such as a hard (BPA-free) plastic or glass container with a tight-fitting lid, or a disposable milk storage bag.Milk expands in the freezer, so leave space in the bag or bottle if you plan to freeze it.Put the date on the container.How much milk should I store?Store milk in small quantities to avoid waste. Small amounts also defrost more quickly.For babies older than one month, a feed is approximately 60–120ml. You could also store some smaller amounts in case you need to offer more.How do I prepare stored milk?You don’t have to warm milk – some babies like it cold!If you do warm milk, run the container under a warm tap or place it in a pan of warm water.Never use a microwave or heat milk directly.Swirl milk to combine rather than shaking it.If defrosting milk, thaw it overnight in a fridge or hold it under warm running water.Thawed milk should not be kept at room temperature. It should either be fed immediately or put in the fridge.Smelly milkSometimes milk smells or tastes soapy after a short time in the fridge or freezer. This is because of an enzyme (lipase) that breaks down fats in milk. The milk is completely safe and most babies will drink it. However, if they refuse to, heat freshly-expressed milk to scalding (bubbling around the edges, but not boiling) and then quickly cool and freeze it. Scalding reduces some of the immune factors, but may be the only option for some families. You can also experiment with the length of storage time needed for the milk to acquire the smell.Feeding your baby your milkSeeFurther Readingand resources below for information on ways to feed your baby your expressed milk.Writtenby Charlotte Allam, March 2023.

"New parents need time to adjust to their new roles. Life may change dramatically, especially for a ﬁrst time mother—many women say they didn’t feel prepared for the emotional upheaval they experienced on becoming a mother. Even experienced mothers can have difﬁculties juggling the needs of the new baby with those of older children.At this time a pair of practical helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding. In the early days, a baby will probably want to breastfeed a lot of the time they are awake. At this stage, a mother may only be managing to eat, sleep and nurse the baby.This is normal. At ﬁrst their mother and nursing will be at the centre of a baby’s world. The security of a baby’s bond with their mother is the basis for all other relationships. A breastfeeding mother generally feels an intense connection with her baby, both emotionally and physically, due to breastfeeding hormones and the practical need to stay close to nurse her baby.This way, babies get what they need to thrive. A baby’s wants are a baby’s needs—they can’t wait like an adult can. By meeting your baby’s needs a mother gives them a secure attachment so they can develop into a conﬁdent child.Why breastfeed?When can a baby start eating solid food?When will a baby sleep through the night?When does breastfeeding stop?Support for mothers is importantWays to support a breastfeeding motherWhat breastfeeding mothers say when asked what would helpWhat about partners?What about dads?Two women having a babyWhat about other family members?What about visitors?Other ways to helpWhen a mum has no supportWhy breastfeed?Breastmilk has everything a growing baby needs in exactly the right amounts and is easy to digest. Research shows that a baby who is not breastfed is more likely to suffer from health problems, both as a child and throughout adulthood. Infant formula increases a child’s risk of (amongst many other health problems): SIDS, Cancer, Obesity, Diabetes, and Allergies.SeeAmazing milkfor more information.What about breastfeeding in public places?Babies often want to breastfeed when people around them are eating and drinking—and why not? Mothers breastfeed in many public places and tend to be so discreet you may not even have noticed.Breastfeeding is also convenient when a mother is out and about. She can spot early feeding cues and offer a feed before her baby gets frantic—well before those around her are even aware. After all, no one notices a baby nestled in mum’s arms but a crying baby guarantees an audience!When can a baby start eating solid food?Breastmilk is a complete food so a healthy baby needs only breastmilk until about the middle of the ﬁrst year. There’s no beneﬁt to be found in introducing solid foods before this time. If a baby seems hungry, more breastmilk usually does the trick—mothers could breastfeed more often, offering both sides. Many babies who start on solid foods from around six months quickly learn to feed themselves and enjoy sitting up with the family at mealtimes.SeeStarting Solid Food.When will a baby sleep through the night?A baby will need to breastfeed during the night for a number of months to ensure they take in enough milk and to maintain their mother’s milk production. Just as there’s no ﬁxed age for when a baby is ready to walk or talk, there’s no real way of knowing when they will be ready to sleep through the night.  Consider whether you sleep through the night now? Many adults wake, turn over and go back to sleep as a matter of course.  As a baby grows their sleep cycles will naturally get longer. In the meantime, they will wake and be likely to need the comfort of mother, her co-parent or other family member’s presence to help them relax and fall back to sleep.What about bottles and dummies?Bottlesordummiescan confuse a baby’s sucking technique, so if a supplement is needed, a spoon, ﬂexible feeding cup or syringe can be used.  Giving formula affects a mother’s milk production since a baby will take less breastmilk. Some mothersexpressmilk for their partner, or another support person, to give but expressing takes more effort than simply breastfeeding.  If a mother is ﬁnding night feeding exhausting you could encourage her to rest during the day, to try feeding lying down and to keep baby close at night so she doesn’t have to get up. See our page onSafer Sleepfor more information.When does breastfeeding stop?When does a baby’s need to use nappies or a highchair stop? It’s all very individual. It doesn’t usually help to push children on to the next stage until they are ready.  Breastmilk is just as nutritious as it was when they were tiny and it still protects them from infection.  There is no evidence that continuing to breastfeed makes a toddler clingy—in fact the opposite may be the case. A toddler may seem big but emotionally they are still a baby. It’s easier on mother and baby to let breastfeeding end gradually.Breastfeeding bonusesNothing compares with breastmilk for growing healthy, clever babies.No getting up to prepare bottles during the night.Your baby’s nappies won’t smell bad.No feeding equipment and expensive formula to buy for your baby.Less to take with you when you go out with your baby.Support for mothers is importantOne very real problem is that many mothers don’t receive enough support in the early days and months, and simply try to do too much. Most mothers who stop breastfeeding before they want to cite lack of support as the reason. They need time to recover and adjust, especially after a difﬁcult birth. Caring for a newborn really is a full time job, and that’s before you add in essential jobs around the house and caring for any older children. All mothers need practical help andsupport.The biggest challenges for all mothers are:Getting enough sleep.Keeping up with basic housework.Lack of emotional support.IsolationThe help you give can make a lot of difference to a new mother, especially when her baby seems to be nursing all the time and is waking at night. Be sensitive to her needs. What you can offer and do will partly depend on whether you are a friend or family member, and the closeness of your relationship. Some mothers will want more practical help, others more emotional help—and a mother may have strong views on what help she will accept and from whom.Ways to support a breastfeeding motherYou may be her partner, the baby’s dad or mum, a family member or friend. All mothers need support, and whatever your relationship to her there are things you can do to help.With baby:Walks in the fresh air. Consider wearing baby in a sling or other carrier.Go out and about; babies are social people.Read and sing to baby—they’ll love hearing your voice.Take a bath together, or bathe them in the baby bath. Many babies love bathtime!Sleep with them. Visit our page onSafer Sleep and the Breastfed Baby.Hold them on your chest while they nap to help your baby feel safe and relaxed.Nappy changes are perfect for games and chat.Talk to your baby about things around the house.Take your baby to their mother whenever they need her.Use the Magic Baby Hold: with your baby’s back against your front, bring your left arm over their left shoulder (one arm on either side of yours), and hold their right thigh.Try othercomfort techniques.Jiggle and sway. Babies tend to like side- to- side motion.For the breastfeeding mother:Make sure she has food and drinks.Cut her food up for her if she’s holding the baby!Hold the baby so she can take a shower.Help her get goodhelpif she needs it.Guard against too many visitors. Let others know when you need to be alone. Protect mum and baby from over-enthusiastic visitors and callers, and try to ensure you all have some peaceful uninterrupted time together. Turn off the phone and put a ‘do not disturb’ sign on the front door.Look after older children. Provide fun activities and opportunity for exercise. Try to meet their needs for attention, sleep and healthy food.Fight off any pressure to separate mum and baby. Help mum and baby spend lots of time snuggling together in the hours and days after birth.What breastfeeding mothers say when asked what would help“The best presents for a new mum are home cooked meals frozen in take away tubs- ready meals but real food!”“Order a box set & takeaway!”“I need friends supporting me, sharing laughter and tears, coffee and cake”“Make sure I have water, muslin, remote control, phone, book & cake”“Bring me snacks that are tasty, healthy and one-handed!”“When it’s really hot and my baby is going through a growth spurt, bring me long, cool glasses of water!”“The best way anyone can help is by taking care of the pile of washing up!”“Call me during the day to say ‘Hi!’ and ask how I’m doing”“Please don’t try and give my baby formula, the moment you do you undermine my confidence in my body’s ability to sustain my baby”“Give me support & encouragement  and tell people who criticise or question me that I’m doing ok”“Don’t tell me it is ‘normal’ and that I should persevere if I am in pain”“Pass me the phone with abreastfeeding counselloron the other end if I’m in pain”“Never say ‘well you are breastfeeding’ when I say I’m tired”“Tell me it’s ok to take one feed at a time”“Give me a thumbs up!”“Tell me my baby is beautiful”“Take my older children to the park”Below is lots of information about supporting a breastfeeding mother, divided into different sections. You may find useful information in all of the sections regardless of your own role and relationship to mum and baby.What about partners?Your baby doesn’t need you to feed them.* So what can you do? Anything else! You are The Safe Person Who Is Not Mum.Whether or not you are your baby’s biological parent, and whatever your family looks like, your partner needs your support.  In the early days, your baby will probably want to breastfeed a lot of the time they are awake. At this stage, your partner may only be managing to eat, sleep and nurse the baby. This is normal.At first their mother and nursing will be the centre of your baby’s world. Don’t worry if you find you don’t get to hold your baby for long before their mum is needed again. A baby’s bond with their mother is the basis for all other relationships. Encouraging the closeness with mum will strengthen their love for you later. Soon that tiny baby will be reaching out to the rest of the world. They will want all the fun and excitement you can give!You are different. Your shape, voice, hands, and smell are different. You hold baby differently. You teach them that different can be good, and when they are frazzled you may be just the difference that your baby needs needs.As life settles down you and your partner will probably both need time to adjust to your new roles as parents. Many women say they didn’t feel prepared for the emotional upheaval they experienced on becoming a mother. You’ll also find lots of changes in your life.Breastfeeding mothers often feel an intense connection with their baby, both emotionally and physically, due to breastfeeding hormones and the practical need to stay close to feed the baby. It can be easy to feel a bit left out of this. Try to get involved in practical ways. It will help you bond with your baby—your partner will love you for it and so will your baby.You may both find that your baby becomes central to your life—their needs being met before either of yours. This is nature’s way of ensuring babies get what they need to thrive.Your first job is to support breastfeeding, not compete with it. A “relief bottle” may seem helpful, but it’s more likely to cause breastfeeding problems and health risks for baby. Protect your partner from criticism and tell her she’s doing a good job. Protect your partner from well meaning but unhelpful advice that undermines breastfeeding—even if it comes from your own mum!Admire and praise your baby’s mother. Your love and encouragement will work wonders. Firmly resist pressures to feed baby anything other than mum’s own milk before he is six months old. Your baby doesn’t need other foods until they can sit up and begin to feed themselves. Even then, breastmilk carries on being an important food for older babies and toddlers.*Some non-gestational mothers do breastfeed their babies. See the sectionTwo women having a babyWhat about dads?Dads feel different, they often have deep voices and a different smell. They move and hold a baby differently. At the end of a long day, dad, with all his special differences, can be just what baby and mother need. Dads are fun and have a special gift for playing with babies. They play the sort of exciting games babies enjoy. Your baby will adore your singing and funny noises (even if mum doesn’t). And you’ll probably enjoy your baby’s toys as much as he does! Dads are just as good at cuddles as mums. A great way to comfort your baby is to use a carrier—babies usually love them and it’s a handy way to settle your baby. At times when your baby is fussy or uncomfortable and nothing else works, thecolic holdis a dad’s speciality.Caring for your baby teaches them that love comes from interacting with people as well as from food.Try some of suggestions in the section aboveWays to support a breastfeeding mother.You can support your baby’s mother by making the most of yourpaternity leave. Take as long as you can manage. Take it when the mother and baby would otherwise be at home alone. Concentrate just on the needs of mum, baby and any other children. Let everything else wait.Meet your baby’s need for you. Your baby needs you to be a dad, not a substitute mother. Spend time with your baby and enjoy your unique father-baby relationship.Two women having a babyFor lesbian couples, if you’re the non-gestational parent you may feel left out – especially if  you have to explain you are the baby’s mother too. Finding support for yourself and your breastfeeding partner is important. Your partner and your baby need you now, and your baby will need you more and more as they grow. You could be entitled topaid leavealthough your employer may not be aware of this, there are resources inFurther Readingthat might help.In some couples two mothers do share breastfeeding; others find different ways to connect, you’ll find lots of ideas in the section aboveWays to support a breastfeeding mother.Deciding to share breastfeeding, and how you do that, are personal decisions. You can read about how one couple shared breastfeedinghere:You will find resources inFurther Reading,or contact your local LLL Leader who can help you talk about your options.What about other family members?Is the new baby in your family breastfed? New research has shown that breastfeeding is important for the baby’s health and development and for the mother’s health, both now and in the future. It’s even good for the environment.Research has found that breastfeeding works best when the baby is fed in response to hunger cues, not on a schedule. That’s usually quite frequently, especially in the beginning. Fortunately, you can’t feed too often.Sore nipples aren’t an expected part of breastfeeding; they are a sign that something isn’t quite right. With some expert help, the mother should soon be breastfeeding comfortably.Most medical experts, including the NHS and theWorld Health Organization, recommend that babies be breastfed exclusively— no formula or solid foods— for six months or so, and continue breastfeeding with solid foods added to their diet into these toddler years—even two years or more.Much of this may be different from what you learned when you had your own babies. But guess what hasn’t changed? New mothers still need lots of help, lots of support, and lots of loving family members around to prepare meals or throw in a load of laundry. They need people to be patient with them as they figure out both breastfeeding and motherhood. And babies still need their grandparents, aunties, uncles, cousins, siblings and other family members to love them. Your practical help and support are a golden investment in your family’s future, and in your lives together.What about visitors?Prioritise tasks: the needs of people are best dealt with before housework. Avoid trying to take over baby care or expecting to be entertained when you visit. Concentrate on ‘mothering the mother’ and helping with household jobs.Offer practical help with housework and essential tasks:grocery shopping, laundry, preparing meals or providing a meal that can simply be reheated, leaving her a sandwich lunch, washing up and cleaning the kitchen, tidying and vacuuming.Bring her the things she needs while nursing: eg drinks, snacks, pillows, books, the TV remote, her mobile.Make her a drink and offer your company for a while.Tell her how well she’s doing.Listen if she is feeling worried, tired, or overwhelmed. She might find it easier to talk to you about her worries than to close family.Help her ﬁnd another mother to talk to.Help with the baby and any older children: changing nappies; care for the baby while mum sleeps, goes to the loo, takes a short walk or a bath.Entertain and care for older children. Perhaps take them out for a walk, to the park or invite them round to play with your children. Help with the school run or taking older children to after school activities.Other ways to helpWelcome breastfeeding so the mum feels comfortable nursing in your presence, be a breastfeeding advocate. Avoid undermining her conﬁdence by asking negative questions like,“Are you sure the baby is getting enough to eat?”or,“Why aren’t they sleeping through the night yet?”.Offer a sympathetic ear rather than advice when she complains or seems tired—try to support and encourage.Find out about what is normal for nursing babies of different ages. Remember that breastfeeding problems have breastfeeding solutions. Bottles or weaning are rarely the answer.Encourage or help the mum to ﬁnd the support she needs.

"Learning you are pregnant with twins, triplets or more changes your expectations and plans. But you can still plan to breastfeed.Breastmilk is a complete and perfect food for your baby. It is especially important for multiples, who are often small at birth. Breastfeeding also helps you create a special bond with each of your babies. Many mothers have nursed their multiples; you can enjoy nurturing your babies this way, too.Planning aheadLimit visitorsMaking enough milkCo-ordinating feedsSeparationNight feedsLooking after yourselfOther sources of practical helpMixed feelingsPracticalities of getting outFinding supportPlanning aheadPhoto courtesy: Roisin KeenanIf possible, attendLa Leche League meetingsor ourAntenatal Breastfeeding classesin pregnancy to learn about breastfeeding and meet breastfeeding mothers. Do readThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, Mothering Multiples by Karen Gromada and our page onBirth and Breastfeeding.Even with good care, you might experience complications during pregnancy so it helps to be prepared. Ask your midwife for information on warning signs for premature labour. Seek medical attention quickly if any occur, or you have any of these symptoms: a severe headache or stomach ache, see spots in front of your eyes, or feel extremely irritable or tense.Limit visitorsLimit visitors in the early days while you are gaining confidence breastfeeding.  Tell friends and family you need time to recover and suggest they visit later, or drop round a meal! You may want to practice feeding two babies together before doing it in front of other people.Making enough milkThe more milk your babies take, the more your breasts will make. This is especially important in the first few weeks. Since mothers of multiples usually experience more breast development during pregnancy, mothers of mulitples can usually produce enough milk for two or even three babies.SeeIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Encourage each baby to feed at least 8–10 times in 24 hours. If one of your babies is too sleepy to rouse himself every few hours, you will need to wake them to feed to ensure they get enough milk. See our pageSleepy Baby—why and what to do.At first you may feel you are doing nothing but feeding, but things will settle down as your babies grow and your milk production adjusts. Practical help with everything else will allow you to sit or lie down and concentrate on the important job of establishing breastfeeding.Co-ordinating feedsOnce breastfeeding is established, you may find nursing two at once is easiest and saves time. But remember each baby is different and one baby may need more feeding than the other.Laid back breastfeeding positionscan leave your hands free to help each baby latch on well. Nursing pillows designed for twins are also available. Feeding two babies at the same time may help if one of your babies is less efficient at nursing, as let-down will occur more easily.SeparationYou can still breastfeed, even if you can’t be with your babies straight away. Hold, or at least touch, your babies immediately after the birth or as soon as you can. You can still touch and stroke a baby in special care and may be able to hold him against you in ‘kangaroo mother care’. If he can’t breastfeed,expressyour milk for him. This is the most important thing you can do whilst you are waiting to start breastfeeding. When you are back together, spend as much time as possible snuggling together skin-to-skin to establish breastfeeding.If you need to express your milk because one or both babies can’t nurse,hand expressionis useful in the first few days. Plan to express from both breasts at least eight times in 24 hours, about every two to three hours during the day and at least once during the night. As your milk increases, you can switch to a hospital grade automatic electric pump. For more expressing, see our articlehere.After separation, many mothers experience shock, sadness, mourning for missed bonding opportunities, worry for babies who are ill, fear and a lack of control. It can be difficult to put into works what you are feeling, but it can have a bit impact on you.Blissoffers free counselling services for parents of premature or sick babies, or you GP can refer you.Night feedsBreastfeeding at night lying down gives you more rest. It gets easier as your babies grow. In the meantime, use enough pillows to recline in bed and feed two babies at once. Keep a drink and snack handy plus books or music to pass the time. SeeSafer Sleep and the Breastfed Baby.Looking after yourselfYou’ll be busy looking after your babies but don’t forget to look after yourself too. Try to eat a balanced diet and drink enough. Get as much rest as possible, and sleep whenever your babies sleep.Looking after your babies will be a full-time job for quite a while so expect to do only the absolute minimum of other tasks.Accept offers of help with housework or olders children if it feels right. Sometimes helpers wait to be asked so having a list of specific tasks ready can make it easier. You could also share our leaflet or link toSupporting a Breastfeeding Mother.Your partner or support person will have a crucial role both practically and emotionally. Other family members and your support network may also enjoy the chance to be practically involved and make quickly develop close relationships with your babies.Take moments to appreciate this special time and be proud that you can nourish and nurture two or more little human beings at once!Other sources of practical helpMidwives, health visitors, clinics and surgeries.Homestart– a charity which offers support and friendship to families who are struggling to cope for a variety of reasons.Mixed feelingsMothers of twins or more often have mixed emotions about being a mother to multiples. It’s normal to feel ‘touched out’, overwhelmed and exhausted when caring for two or more babies at once. It can really help to talk to another mother in the same situation. Yourlocal LLL Leadercan put you in touch with other mothers who have breastfed multiples. Consider joining the ‘Breastfeeding Twins and Triplets’Facebook group. There may also be a local twins support group near you (seeFurther Informationsection).Adjusting to Motherhoodhas practical tips on dealing with feelings too.Practicalities of getting outIt’s daunting leaving the house with more than one baby. Start by going out briefly with someone else to help.Keep a changing bag packed and ready. A backpack leaves your hands free.Keep valuables and keys safe to hand in a waist pack or small bag across your chest.Slings designed for twins are available. Consider using a sling or carrier for one baby even when out with a pushchair. A double pushchair can be useful for carrying shopping too.Alternate which baby gets carried: it’s easy to overlook a quieter baby’s need for closeness if one fusses more when out and about.Think about suitable places for feeding ahead of time. Look out for your babies’ early feeding cues so you can offer a feed before they start to fuss and attract attention from others. You may prefer to feed one baby at a time while out and feed two together at home. Or you may quickly get to grips with feeding two babies together while out. It’s a great way to quieten two hungry babies and quickly meet their needs.Get to know your babiesWith time, you will come to know your babies as individuals. Take opportunities to give them a little undivided attention: feeding, nappy changes etc. A few minutes here and there all add up. Their different personalities will soon show through.Finding supportIt can take a while for breastfeeding to become easy, or for your babies to learn to breastfeed effectively. If you need to seek out breastfeeding support as soon as you encounter a problem – don’t wait. You can get skilled help from an LLL Leader and support and encouragement from yourlocal LLL group.Further ReadingAdjusting to MotherhoodAntenatal Expression of ColostrumBirth and BreastfeedingCaesarean Birth and BreastfeedingHand Expression of BreastmilkMy Baby Needs More MilkSleepy Baby – Why and What to DoSupporting A Breastfeeding MotherMothering through special careLLLI ResourcesBreastfeeding Premature BabiesWhen there are two – breastfeeding twinsOther websitesInformation on nursing multiplesby the author of Mothering Multiples.Breastfeeding Twins and Tripletsby Kathryn Stagg, IBCLCBooksThe Womanly Art Of Breastfeeding.

"Mastitis (breast inflammation), includes a wide range of symptoms, from a small, tender area (often called a blocked duct), through to severe infection.If your breasts are inflamed or swollen, it’s important to act quickly to relieve discomfort and stop it getting worse. You may also need to deal with any underlying causes.LLL Leadersare here to help.What do all these words mean? A quick guideWhat are the signs of mastitis?Why does it happen?What can I do?Do I need medical help?How can I prevent mastitis in the future?What do all these words mean? A quick guideMastitisjust means ‘breast inflammation’. Recent research is changing how mastitis is viewed and treated. It’s now understood as a wide spectrum, from a small, tender area – often called ablocked duct– to a severe infection.Milk blisters/blebslook like tiny white or yellow dots on the tip of the nipple. They can cause no trouble, or they might be very painful (often described as ‘stinging’ pain). Sometimes they form in one or more ‘milk pores’, blocking milk from coming out of part of the breast. They are part of the mastitis spectrum of related conditions and the self-treatment measures suggested for mastitis may help. Milk blisters thatdon’t block milk coming out, and don’t hurt, can be safely left alone. They eventually disappear.Engorgementis when the whole breast becomes swollen with extra fluid. It’s common 2-5 days after birth, when milk production is increasing very fast. The mastitis self-treatment measures described below are helpful for engorged breasts, too. Treat engorgement promptly to avoid developing mastitis.A breast abscessis a collection of pus (infection) within the breast. It is usually a complication of mastitis that was not adequately treated. An abscess needs urgent medical treatment: drainage and antibiotics.What are the signs of mastitis?One or more areas that are tender (sometimes called a blocked duct).Your breast might feel warmer, harder, or lumpier than usual.There may be a patch of skin on your breast that has changed colour (dark skin might look darker than usual, on light skin you might see a red patch).You might have a fever and feel like you have the flu. Your body may respond to inflammation with an increase in temperature — it doesn’t necessarily mean you have an infection. See below, “Do I need medical help?”Could it be a breast abscess?Most (though not all) people with an abscess feel very ill. If you have one or more lumps in your breast that don’t get smaller as milk is removed, and don’t respond to the treatments for mastitis suggested in this article, contact your GP or NHS 111. An abscess needs urgent medical treatment. It’s usually possible — and may be preferable — to continue breastfeeding while an abscess is treated, if you want to. LLL Leaders can support you through it.Why does it happen?When breasts are too full of milk, or the breast is injured, your body may react with inflammation – a response to a threat. Blood flow to the area increases, and fluids and immune cells rush in to repair damage and fight off bacteria. As pressure within the breast increases, it feels tender or painful, and it may become difficult for the milk to flow easily.Common causes of mastitisIssues withpositioning and attachment:Your baby is not removing milk efficiently.Scheduling or limiting feeds:If breasts aren’t relieved as often as they need to be, this can result in mastitis (and decreased milk production). The amount of milk breasts can hold – and how long they can comfortably hold it for – varies hugely between individuals, and changes over time.Oversupply:Having a lot more milk than you need. Sometimes it’s caused by ‘overpumping’. Sometimes it just happens – this is more likely with second or subsequent babies. Your baby may get upset, gag, and splutter when your milk releases. They are probably growing very fast. Your breast/s may feel uncomfortably full a lot of the time. If you’re struggling with oversupply, LLL Leaders can help.Suddenly removing less milk than usual:For example, because your baby is ill, sleeping longer, or you are away from your baby.Weaning:If you reduce the amount you breastfeed faster than your breasts can manage.Less common causes of mastitisBreast injury, e.g. from a too-tight bra, bag or sling strap, breast pump, or seatbelt. Or even sleeping on your stomach.Bacterial infection in the breast,possibly through an open nipple wound.Factors that may make mastitis more likely:SmokingPrevious breast surgery, such as implantsBeing under a lot more stress than usual, or extremely exhaustedBeing anaemic or having other health conditions that make your immune system work less wellGut health. Some experts think that imbalances in the ‘microbiome’ (the bacteria that live in your body) may make some people more likely to get mastitis. The breast has its own microbiome which is affected by many factors, including your diet, antibiotic use, and whether your baby feeds direct at the breast. It’s a developing field of research.Causes of engorgementIn the first few days after birth, you may have more engorgement if you were given extra fluids during labour and birth. But engorgement can happen at any stage of breastfeeding if there’s more milk than your breast/s can comfortably hold. For example, if:your baby is unwell and feeding less than usual, or less than your breasts needyour baby starts sleeping for a longer stretch at nightyou are away from your baby and don’t express as often as your breasts need.My breasts are engorged, or I think I’ve got mastitis – what do I need to do?Start treatment at the first signs of breast swelling or inflammation. It’s often possible to deal with it at home without medical help.Take standard doses of an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicationsuch as ibuprofen, if you can usually take it. Paracetamol may also be helpful if you’re in pain, but ibuprofen is more useful for mastitis, because it also reduces inflammation. Both are safe to take while breastfeeding.Experiment with cold or cool compresseson the affected area/s between feeds, to see what helps you feel most comfortable.  Some cultures and communities advise new mothers to avoid cold in the early week after birth, and to use heat instead — if this is the case for you, see “things to avoid”, below.Remove milk as often as you need to, to keep the breast as comfortable as you can.Feed your baby whenever they want to be fed or continue expressing whenever you would usually express. Offer a feed or express some milk if your breast feels very full and uncomfortable.Rest as much as you can.Inflammation is tiring for your whole body. Those who have had mastitis often say that they got it when they were under extra stress, or busier than usual – it may be a sign that you need to slow down. Rest is an important part of healing. Taking time off work, or having a partner or support person help you care for your baby can be useful for a few days.Experiment with different feeding positions.This may help you be more comfortable and help to drain different areas of the breast.Some experts recommend takingprobiotics,or the food supplementlecithin.Check with your healthcare provider, a breastfeeding supporter, or LLL websites for current information.Contact an LLL Leaderoryour local LLL groupfor more information and support.Things to avoidSome of the treatments that used to be recommended for mastitis don’t help, and may even make things worse:Rough massage of your breasts.This can increase inflammation – and really hurts! If you want to massage while feeding or expressing, use gentle touch, as if you were stroking a cat.Applying a lot of heat, e.g. hot showers or compresses.Heat can increase inflammation.  If a little warmth helps the milk to flow when you’re feeding or expressing, or helps you feel more comfortable between feeds, use it for as short a time as possible. Don’t direct a hot shower straight at your breast.Electric toothbrushes, combs or other devices.Trying to force milk out of the breast won’t fix the inflammation and may make it worse.Trying to remove a lot more milk than usual.This can increase the amount of milk you’re producing, increasing pressure in the breast. If you need to express more milk than your baby wants, aim to express just enough to be comfortable – not every available drop.My breasts feel full but I can’t get milk out – help!Babies sometimes refuse to feed on a breast that has mastitis.The milk is safe for your baby but may taste different from usual. Your baby may also be objecting to a slower flow of milk – some people notice a temporary supply dipduring mastitis. It usually goes back to normal when the breast has recovered. You will need to express milk from the affected breast until your baby is willing to feed on it again.SeeNursing Strikesfor ideas to encourage your baby to feed.What if your baby will feed, or you’re trying to express, but little or no milk is coming out?Don’t panic!Engorgement or mastitis can act like a traffic jam in the breast.These tips can help you get the milk moving again:Treat the inflammationby taking ibuprofen and perhaps applying a cold compress about 20-30 minutes before you feed or express.If your baby is struggling to attach because the whole breast is engorged (full and tight), tryexpressing a little milkbefore offering the breast to your baby. Or try‘reverse pressure softening’: press firmly around the nipple with fingertips or finger lengths for about one minute before feeding. This moves swelling away from the nipple.Try gentle ‘lymphatic drainage’ massage (towards your armpit). See Further Reading.Do I need medical help?If you’re feeling okay in yourself (you don’t have a fever or feel ill), you can try treating yourself at home for 24 hours. If by that time your symptoms are improving, you can continue for another 24 hours.Contact NHS 111 or your GP straight away if:Your symptoms are the same after 24 hours, or getting worseYou start to feel ill – shivery, shaky, like you have fluYou have a feverA patch on your breast has changed colour and is getting larger, or you see streaks on your breastYou see signs of infection, such as a wound that looks crusty or oozes yellow, or your nipple is a different shape, size, or colour from normal.You may need antibiotics. TheNHS guideline on mastitissays that you should usually be given a 10-14 day course (if you have a shorter course, the mastitis is more likely to come back). If you need antibiotics, it’s important to keep up with the self-help treatments above, as well as taking the medication. Let your doctor know if you’re still not feeling any better by the third day after starting antibiotics.How can I prevent mastitis in the future?Get breastfeeding help if you need it.A breastfeeding supporter can help you get your baby deeply and comfortably attached at the breast.Keep your milk flowing.Avoid too much milk building up in your breasts: feed or express as much as your baby wants, and offer extra feeds or express some milk if your breasts become uncomfortable at other times. If you have a lot more milk than you need, a breastfeeding supporter can help.Check your breast comfort.Make sure nothing is pressing on the breast (see above, “Why does it happen?”)Watch out for early signs of mastitisand start self-help measures right away.Mastitis can be horrible, and make you question whether you can carry on breastfeeding. It’s important not to suddenly stop removing milk while you’ve got mastitis, as this can lead to complications. You need plenty of practical and emotional support, and good medical care if necessary, until you’re feeling better.Written by Jayne Joyce and Justice ReillyLast updated June 2024Further ReadingA Sudden End to BreastfeedingComfortable BreastfeedingDummies & BreastfeedingEngorged Breasts – Avoiding & TreatingExpressing Your MilkHand Expression of BreastmilkHow Milk Production WorksMy Baby Won’t BreastfeedPositioning & AttachmentRhythms & RoutinesSleep Baby – Why and What To DoTongue-tie & BreastfeedingToo Much Milk & OversupplyWhen a Mother is UnwellLa Leche League International article on mastitis:https://llli.org/breastfeeding-info/mastitis/ReferencesMastitisBaeza, C. et al. 2022.

"Does your baby need more milk?How to know your baby is getting enough breastmilkIncreasing your milk productionIf supplements are neededFeeding methodsExpressing your milkDoes your baby need more milk?Although most mothers are able to produce enough milk for their babies’ needs, you may have concerns about your own milk production. Perhaps you and your baby had a difficult start, or were not given the support you needed to establish breastfeeding. Or maybe things were going well until your baby’s weight gain faltered.If others question your milk production and your baby is fussy, wants to feed much of the time, seems small, or gains weight slowly, you may be wondering whether you have enough milk.Follow your baby not the bookYoung babies need to nurse frequently to get enough milk and establish their mother’s milk production. Following feeding schedules, using regular supplements, nipple shields, or a dummy can really reduce your milk production.Breastmilk is also a drink and frequent nursing is normal. Adults rarely go longer than two hours without a drink, snack or meal. Your baby’s tummy is tiny and breastmilk is quickly digested, so they need frequent feeds to help them grow. It is recommended that your baby is weighed no more than once a month for the first six months, unless there are concerns.Sleepy BabyA baby who sleeps a lot rather than waking to feed every 2–3 hours may need to be woken up to  nurse, particularly if they have jaundice or aren’t gaining enough weight. If this is difficult or your baby is lethargic, ask your midwife, health visitor or GP to check that all is well.See our articleSleepy Baby – why and what to dofor more information.How to know your baby is getting enough breastmilkWeight gainIt is normal for newborns to lose up to 7% of their birth weight in the first few days. Once your milk production increases, usually on day 3–4, expect your baby to begin gaining weight. Most babies regain their birth weight by the age of 10–14 days. You may also find it helpful to seeIs my baby getting enough milk?Plot your baby’s weight gain on a UK–WHO growth chart based on the growth rates of breastfed babies (see examples below and Further Reading). Although they will be growing at their own individual rate, it will give you an indication of how they are doing.Monitor your baby’s weight over a period of time rather than week by week. Your baby’s weight may generally follow the chart, or climb up, crossing the percentile lines. A gradual drop from one percentile line to the next (or the equivalent distance) is unlikely to be a problem unless their weight is low for their age. Heavier newborns often show ‘catch-down’ growth – they gain weight steadily but drop gradually against the chart lines.Dropping against the chart is more of a worry for lower weight babiesIf your baby’s growth curve drops across two lines of the chart (or the equivalent distance), or if their weight is below the lowest line of the chart:Follow the suggestions here to ensure they get more milk.Seek help from your GP to rule out an underlying medical reason for your baby’s slow weight gain.If you have doubts about your baby’s growth, you may find it reassuring to talk to an LLL Leader.Wet and dirty nappiesIf your baby receives enough milk, the thick and sticky black meconium poos will be passed within three days of birth, followed by at least 6–8 wet and 3–5 dirty nappies in each 24 hours. Expect yellow, loose, unformed poos at least the size of a 2p coin. From about six weeks, some babies have abundant poos once every few days. This isn’t a problem when a baby has plenty of wet nappies.Look at your babyYou may instinctively know how your baby is doing. Are they nursing vigorously? Is their skin firm? Do they look healthy and seem active and alert? Are they meeting developmental milestones?RememberEven if your breasts feel empty, there’s always some milk there.Full breasts and engorgement slow milk production – you may need to nurse more often. Removing even small amounts of milk from soft breasts increases milk production.Babies nurse for comfort as well as for food. Those little ‘snack’ comfort feeds can really increase your milk production and their calorie intake.Expect your baby to want to breastfeed very often from time to time.Your breasts will quickly adjust to making more milk if you follow your baby’s cues.Every baby has a unique feeding pattern.If your baby is gaining weight adequately, following their own feeding pattern is the best way of ensuring you are meeting their needs. It’s rare that a mother cannot produce enough milk for her baby, and there are lots of ways to increase the amount of breastmilk your baby gets.Increasing your milk productionAfter the first few weeks, supply and demand drives milk production. To increase your milk supply,  focus on feeding more often and getting more milk out at each feed. For more information about how breasts make milk, see our articleHow milk production worksand alsoHow to increase your milk supply.Breastfeeding basicsBreastfeed as often as possible – at least 10 times in 24 hours. Wake your baby if necessary.Switch sides when your baby’s suck-swallow pattern starts to slow. Continue to switch sides (four times or more) until they reject the breast.Use breast compression (see below).Instead of breastfeeding at set intervals, encourage ‘cluster feeding’ – breastfeeding very often at times when your baby is willing to.Encourage breastfeeding for comfort as well as for food. It can really help your milk production. Stop using dummies – breastfeed instead.Ensure you are meeting your baby’s needs for milk during the night, feeding at least once every four hours.Cut back a little on your baby’s solid foods if your milk production is dropping (see below).An effective latchA baby may spend a long time at the breast but not get very much milk if they are not latched on effectively. Check your baby is well attached – watch and listen for swallowing which is frequent at the start and then slows down.Contact an LLL Leader for one-to-one support and see Further Reading for more information. It’s important to seek skilled help early on if you are finding breastfeeding difficult, uncomfortable or painful.Take a ‘baby moon’Get some help with the housework and eat simple, easily-prepared meals for a week or two so you can concentrate on breastfeeding your baby. A couple of days’ bed rest together, feeding your baby on demand can really boost your milk production. Or at least take some time each day to rest with them and concentrate on breastfeeding.Try laid-back breastfeedingMany babies instinctively seek the breast and feed frequently if they can snuggle up close to their mother’s chest.Try letting your baby lie on your body, skin to skin (with a blanket if needed) as you recline, so both their chest and tummy are against you.This close body contact gives your baby lots of opportunity to breastfeed, even in a light sleep, and boosts levels of the hormones that increase your milk. A soft carrier or sling helps to keep your baby close and encourages breastfeeding. (seePositioning and Attachmentfor more on laid back breastfeeding)Breast compressionThis technique puts pressure on the milk ducts and can help to make feeding more efficient:Support your breast with one hand – thumb on one side, fingers on the other.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, their jaw moving all the way to their ear. When their swallowing slows, compress your breast firmly to increase milk flow and encourage swallowing. Hold it squeezed while they continue nursing actively, then release your hand.Rotate your hand around the breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast.Go gently – this should not hurt.Other foodsBabies need only human milk for the first six months (human milk is higher in calories than many weaning foods). Too much solid food replacing human milk can affect weight gain in older babies.  Breastfeed before offering solid foods if your baby is under 12 months old. Even at 12 months, both human milk and solids are equally important. Breastfeed frequently and, rather than spoon-feeding, offer your baby a variety of foods, letting them feed themselves to ensure they take only what they need.Continued low milk productionIf you’ve tried all these suggestions and your milk production has not increased enough, there may be a medical reason. Some medical conditions can lead to low milk production, though appropriate treatment can reduce the impact. These situations are rare, but you can discuss possibilities with an LLL Leader. For more information see our articleHow to increase your milk supplyand Further Reading.Signs your milk is increasingWatch for weight gain and an increase in your baby’s wet and dirty nappies. Your breasts may feel fuller before feeds and begin to leak.Looking after yourselfDon’t forget to be kind to yourself, especially if you’re feeling under pressure. Now is the time to call in favours from friends and relatives so you can concentrate on your baby. If your baby needs more milk, talking to your local LLL Leader will help. You can share your concerns with other mothers at an LLL meeting, who will be able to give you encouragement and support.If supplements are neededIt can be a challenge fitting in breastfeeding, supplementing and expressing. You could try the following approach, aiming for at least 8 feeds in 24 hours. At each feed:Start with breastfeeding, observing your baby’s swallowing pattern. Use breast compressions to maximise the flow. When swallowing slows, switch sides and repeat. If your baby has enough energy, you can repeat this process (known as ‘switch nursing’). This part of the feed might take 10–30 minutes, but use swallowing as your guide. A baby who is not swallowing isn’t taking in any milk so move to step 2.Give your supplementwith a spoon, syringe,nursing supplementer, finger feeding tube, orbottle. Give stored breastmilk first, then supplement with other milk. Follow your baby’s lead until they are satisfied. A baby who is underweight may become extra hungry for a while. By giving them extra milk, you will help them gain weight and get the energy they need to breastfeed better. To save time, this step could be done by your support person while you express. For more on ways to give your baby more milk, see our article onBottles and other tools.Express both breastsusing a combination of pumping and hand expression, switching back and forth as milk flow slows. Store this milk in the fridge ready for the next feed. By removing the milk your baby couldn’t, you build your future milk production and have milk to supplement the next feed. This is an important step, especially if you are working to eliminate formula supplements.Finish at the breast.The whole feed may take 60–90 minutes. If it works for you, you might offer the breast at the end of the feed so your baby associates the breast with being calm, happy and satisfied. Suckling can help them settle to sleep, too.Keep a record of the amounts of each supplement your baby takes at each feed and also what you express. This can help you see your progress and maybe useful for anyone supporting you with breastfeeding.Feeding methodsCup, spoon and syringe feedingcan work when small amounts are needed.Anursing supplementercan be used to give larger amounts while your baby is at the breast. Another option isfinger feeding, using an infant feeding tube. One end of the tube is taped to your finger. As your baby sucks on your finger, milk flows along the tube from a container which can be raised or lowered to change flow. An LLL Leader can help you find out more and choose an option that works best for you.If using a bottle,paced bottle feedingcan help ensure your baby doesn’t take more milk than they need.A smaller teat hole prevents a baby taking milk too quickly.Hold them in an upright position, using your hand to support their neck and head.To encourage your baby to open wide, place the teat across their lips with the tip between the upper lip and nose.Allow your baby some control. Let them take the bottle teat into their mouth themself. Avoid pushing the teat into their mouth.Tilt the bottle just enough to fill the tip of the teat and give a gentle flow so your baby isn’t overwhelmed with milk. As the bottle empties, gradually tilt the bottle more and lean your baby back.Encourage frequent pauses to mimic breastfeeding, and allow your baby to decide when they have had enough.For more information seeBottles and other tools.Expressing your milkA baby nursing well at the breast is more effective than any pump. But while your baby isn’t breastfeeding well or you’re giving supplements, expressing your milk will stimulate milk production. Give any expressed milk before you give infant formula, so none of your precious breastmilk is wasted.Nurse your baby frequently so they get the extra milk you make. An increase in the amount you can express is a sign that you can reduce supplements if your baby is nursing well and often.Hospital-grade pumps are the most effective for mothers needing to increase their milk, but any pump that works well for you is fine.Try hands-on pumping: use breast massage and breast compressions while pumping, then hand express afterwards to get the last few drops of milk. For more on hand expressing see our article:Hand expressionPumping on both sides at the same time boosts milk-producing hormones. When pumping one side at a time, switch back and forth several times as milk flow slows.Consider power pumping: experiment with pumping very frequently for short periods to mimic cluster feeding.Wash your pump with hot soapy water, or sterilise it once a day. Pump equipment can be left at room temperature for short periods, or stored in the fridge for longer periods. For more information, see our articleExpressing Your Milk.Good times to express milkAfter feeds while your baby sleeps – ‘putting in an order’ for more milk later. Milk expressed after a feed may be small in quantity, but is high in calories.Between feeds if your baby is too sleepy to nurse frequently.While holding your baby, or with them nearby. Expressing little and often can be better than long sessions. Try some ‘power pumping’ during the evening, or fit in some extra pumping sessions one day. You should notice an increase in milk production a couple of days later.Using donor milk and formula to support breastfeedingThe use of donor milk or infant formula is sometimes essential to meet a baby’s nutritional needs. You may need to use donor milk or formula as a short-term measure while you work to increase your milk production. See our articleUsing donor milk & formula to support breastfeedingfor more information.Supplementing with donor milk or formula without protecting your milk supply may reduce the duration of your breastfeeding journey.Powdered infant formula is not a sterile product. To reduce health risks associated with using infant formula, carefully follow the NHS guidelines for preparing it. La Leche League does not recommend the use of homemade formula. The NHS guide to bottle feeding is available online (see Further Reading).Written by Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGBFurther ReadingHow to increase your milk supplyHow milk production worksUsing donor milk and formula to support breastfeedingDummies and BreastfeedingHand expressing of breastmilkComfortable BreastfeedingIs my baby getting enough milk?Nursing SupplementersPositioning & AttachmentRhythms and RoutinesSafe sleep and the Breastfed BabySleep baby – why and what to doStoring your milkAfter a difficult startBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, LLLI.

"While it’s good to have plenty of milk, some mothers produce more milk than their babies need. This is usually called oversupply.Some babies cope very well with a generous milk supply; however, others will be unhappy and uncomfortable even though they are gaining weight and appearing to thrive. Oversupply can also make feeding uncomfortable and increase the risk of mastitis.Symptoms of oversupplyHow does oversupply happen?How is your milk supply established?A note about foremilk and hindmilkWhat can I do about the symptoms of oversupply?Reducing your milk supplyIf you still have problemsBreast compressionAdjusting to the new normalSymptoms of oversupplyThe main symptoms of oversupply for a baby are:Very fast weight gain, moving upwards through centile linesExplosive green frothy poosStruggling to control milk flowPain and excessive wind or ‘gas’You may also notice the following:Choking, coughing, and pulling on and off the breastClamping down and biting to slow the flow of milkFrequent spitting upAlways appearing hungry and unsatisfied despite large weight gainUnwillingness to nurse to sleepBreast refusalFaltering weight gain due to breast refusalLots of wet and dirty nappiesGeneral ‘colicky’ behaviourA mother with oversupply may have the following symptoms:Breasts that are rarely soft or comfortableA forceful or ‘over-active’ letdown (milk ejection reflex)A painful letdownA lot of leakingPainful nipplesas a result of clamping down and bitingRecurring blocked ducts and/or mastitisSome of these symptoms may have other causes; allergies and reflux, for example, can have similar symptoms to oversupply. They may also fall within the normal range. Therefore, it is important to rule out other possibilities before taking steps to reduce your milk supply, as this can have longer term consequences.How does oversupply happen?Some mothers naturally produce large quantities of milk, and we tend to produce more milk with each baby. Occasionally, there are medical reasons for having much more milk than your baby needs. Oversupply can also occur as a result of breastfeeding management, for example, when a baby’s feeds are scheduled, or if a mother is told to feed from each breast for a certain amount of time. It can happen if a pump is used too often, or used in a way that overstimulates the breast.Milk production is best regulated by your baby’s appetite. When you breastfeed responsively, rather than by following a schedule, your milk production adapts to their needs. Occasionally, a poor latch can contribute to oversupply as a baby might feed very frequently to get the volume they need. However, this tends to reduce milk supply over time.How is your milk supply established?After your baby is born, milk production is regulated on a supply and demand basis. Put simply, the more milk you remove, the more milk you are likely to make. How quickly or slowly milk is made depends on the fullness of the breast – an ‘empty’ breast makes milk more quickly, a full breast makes milk more slowly.It takes a few weeks for your supply to settle down to what your baby actually needs. It is not unusual in the early weeks to feel as if you have too much milk, and to have times when the breasts feel full or even engorged. This is not the same as oversupply.Feeding frequently and removing milk from the breasts is essential to resolvingengorgement– it won’t make the engorgement worse or result in too much milk.Babies usually nurse more during developmental leaps and growth spurts, and many mothers find there are changes to their baby’s nursing pattern during holidays and family get-togethers, or during periods of stress. Milk supply is very adaptable – if you follow your baby and your body, your supply will most likely regulate itself.Read more abouthow milk production works.A note about foremilk and hindmilkOne of the symptoms of oversupply in a baby is green frothy poos, gas, and pain. This is sometimes calledlactose overloador aforemilk-hindmilk imbalance.You may be given confusing information about foremilk and hindmilk, and how long a feed ‘should’ last. Or think that there are two different kinds of milk – lower-fat and fat-rich – and that one is better than the other.Typically, thefat contentdoesincrease during a feed, as the fat globules tend to be drawn down towards the end of a feed. However, it is not the length of a feed that is important, but the length of timebetweenfeeds. Fat content is determined mostly by the fullness of the breast. If there is a long gap between feeds and the breast is full, the baby may get a large quantity of lower-fat milk before much of the fat starts getting pulled down. The same may be true if a mother naturally produces very large quantities of milk. In the absence of fat-rich milk, the lower-fat milk moves through the gut faster than it can be digested, causing green poos, gas, and pain.All breastmilk is good!What matters most to weight gain is overall milk volume.What can I do about the symptoms of oversupply?To start with, you might like to:adjust your position and your baby’s attachment to help them manage a fast letdownfeed responsively (as often as your baby wants) and/or offer more frequent feedsuse breast massageavoid overpumpingManaging a Fast letdownA fast letdown can beonesymptom of oversupply. It is possible to have a fast letdown with an ‘average’ milk production. When your baby nurses, a hormonal reflex causes milk to release, (what is known as ‘letdown’). When this happens, it is not unusual for milk to spray out quickly. Some babies like this fast flow, but others are upset by it and struggle to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. You may find it helpful to:Ensure that your baby isdeeply attached at the breast. This will make it easier for them to manage a fast flow.Try different positions. Some parents use gravity to help them by feeding in a ‘laid-back’ (reclined) position. Others find it helps to feed in a more upright position such as a ‘koala hold’, or to feed while using a sling or baby carrier. Side-lying may also be helpful as excess milk can easily leak out.Allow your baby to come off the breast when they need to catch their breath, and use a muslin to catch the spray.Some mothershand expressa little to slow the flow before bringing the baby to the breast (however, if this is done frequently, it may make oversupply worse).If your breast is very full and engorged, you might try ‘reverse pressure softening’ to move fluids away from the nipple area as this can help your baby to latch more deeply.Feed frequently so that the milk spray doesn’t have quite so much volume and force behind it.Try breastfeeding before your baby is really hungry, or while they are slightly sleepy.Responsive feedingHow do you know how often or how long to feed your baby for? Let your baby tell you! We all have different milk storage capacities and this may determine how frequently your baby feeds, and whether they feed from one side or two. Allow your baby to feed from the first breast for as long as they want to before offering the second breast – they may or may not take it.Sometimes babies will only take one breast, and sometimes two (or three or four!). Most babies will take both breasts, at least some of the time. Babies are very good at letting us know how often they want to feed, and if in doubt, it is always fine to offer.Breast massageYou could do what is sometimes called the ‘breast milkshake’. This involves massaging each breast very gently for half a minute or so before feeding, then using a combination of massage and breast compression (see below) during a feed to help dislodge some of the fat. Any massage should use a light fingertip pressure such as you would use to apply body lotion.ExpressingOveruse of pumps – or using a pump in a way that unintentionally stimulates milk production (such as a silicone pump to collect dripping milk) – can make oversupply worse. If you’ve beenexpressingregularly, reduce this gradually to avoid further problems.Reducing your milk supplyIf your baby is gaining more weight than average and you and your baby are happy, then you don’t need to change anything. It is not possible to overfeed a breastfed baby.If you or your baby are struggling with some of the above symptoms, you have ruled out other causes and changes to breastfeeding management do not help, then you may want to consider taking steps to gradually slow milk production.Consult an LLL Leaderbefore using these approaches. This is especially important if your baby is under one month old, or you are experiencing other problems such as sore nipples or mastitis.Monitor your baby’s weight gain to ensure it doesn’t drop below expected levels, and keep a close eye on nappy output.One side per feedLimit your baby to one breast per feed. If your baby wants to have a short rest during a feed, then offer the same breast again. When a mother has a generous milk storage capacity, their baby may only need to feed on one side. This approach may help milk production to reduce in line with their baby’s demand.Block feedingBlock feeding involves feeding on the same side for a set period of time (block), e.g. for two or three hours. If your baby wants to feed again within that time block, offer the same side. As a starting point, you might like to:Limit your baby to one breast for about two hours, allowing them to nurse as often and for as long as they like, but only on that one side.Continue in this way, switching breasts every two hours. If your baby is asleep, switch breasts when they wake.It is important not to have a rigid approach to block feeding: read your breasts and your baby, not just the clock. By doing this, you will find the time block that works best for both of you. If the unused breast feels uncomfortably full before the next feed then ‘express to comfort’only.It is possible to experience oversupply in just one breast, in which case you could nurse for longer periods on the unaffected side.Full drainage and block feeding methodFor more severe oversupply – for example, if you are suffering from recurrent blocked ducts or mastitis and your breasts never feel soft and comfortable even after a breastfeed – you will need to keep your breasts well drained while you take steps to reduce milk production.You could try the following, in consultation with an infant feeding specialist, in addition to block feeding:Express from both sides thoroughly to ‘empty’ your breasts as fully as possible.After expressing, immediately offer both ‘empty’ breasts to your baby.Next, limit your baby to one breast changing sides every two or three hours (see block feeding above).Some mothers will need to use this approach only once. However, if your breasts feel uncomfortably full, you may need to repeat it, increasing the interval between each pump for your breasts to readjust.Medications and herbs to reduce milk productionThere are herbs and medications that can help dry up your milk production. Talk with your health care provider or a lactation consultant.If you still have problemsAfter 4–7 days, your breasts may be more comfortable. If you and your baby still have trouble coping with the supply of milk, you can gradually increase the time block you keep your baby to one breast. Some women with extreme oversupply have gone as long as six or more hours before switching breasts to adjust milk production. A hormonal imbalance may cause overproduction of milk, but this is rare. A visit to your doctor may be helpful if the suggestions offered here aren’t enough.Block feeding should be a temporary measure. In practice, it is suggested that it is done for no more than one week, and only when babies are gaining double (or more) the average weight for their age. Once supply has settled, you can return to a more normal feeding pattern, following and trusting your baby and your body.Breast compressionBabies used to a generous milk flow can become fussy at the breast when milk flow slows. They may have to work harder at the breast and deepen their latch to remove milk effectively. Breast compression will increase milk flow and encourage your baby to keep feeding actively:Support your breast with one hand – thumb on one side, fingers on the other.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively (slow, rhythmic sucking, lots of swallowing). When their swallowing slows, compress your breast gently to increase milk flow and encourage swallowing. Hold it squeezed while they continue nursing actively, then release your hand.Rotate your hand around your breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast as needed. Be gentle – this shouldn’t hurt.Adjusting to the new normalAlways monitor your baby’s weight gain, wet and dirty nappies, and overall well-being while following these strategies. Monitor their weight over a period of several weeks to see a trend. If your baby had been gaining weight very quickly, you may see ‘catch-down’ growth. Your baby will gain weight steadily, but may gradually drop against the percentile lines as your milk production adjusts. Their weight should then settle into following a new percentile line on the chart.As your supply reduces, your breasts will feel softer and more comfortable, and leaking will be reduced. Soft comfortable breasts between feeds during the early weeks are normal and a sign that your milk production is in tune with your baby’s needs.Written by Charlotte AllamLast updated May 2023Kimberly Seals Allers’ photos on this site are used under a creative commons license of Black Breastfeeding 360°http://mochamanual.com/bb/Further ReadingMastitisEngorged Breasts – Avoiding & TreatingHand Expression of BreastmilkIs My Baby Getting Enough MilkComfortable BreastfeedingRhythms & RoutinesThe Unhappy Breastfed BabyRefluxAllergies and IntolerancesFat Content of Breastmilk – FAQsPositioning and AttachmentOther websitesUK–WHO Growth Charts:www.rcpch.ac.uk/growthchartsBlock Feeding Dos and Don’ts:http://www.nancymohrbacher.com/articles/2013/10/9/block-feeding-dos-donts.html?rq=oversupplyBooksThe Womanly Art Of Breastfeeding.

"Newborn baby latched soon after birthComfortable positioning and attachment are important for all mothers. You will have time to practice with your baby while your breasts are still soft before your milk increases. The earlier you start, the easier it is. Hold your baby in skin-to-skin contact right after birth -continue this for as much time as you can during the following days and weeks.Use your baby’s natural reflexes to encourage them to latch on: skin-to-skin contact helps give your baby easy access to your breast.Find a comfortable position where you feel well supported: sitting, lying back or lying down.Avoid using pillows and cushions under your baby—use them just for your own comfort to support your head, shoulders, body, arms and legs.Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby. Relax comfortably with your breast in its natural position. Your body can support your baby so your arms don’t take all their weight.Baby is in full body contact with their mother’s bodyWhen your baby’s whole front is in close contact with your body their movements will be more coordinated. They can search for your breast with a little help and encouragement from you. It helps your baby if their feet are resting against something firm like your thigh or hand.It’s normal for a baby to bob at the breast and lick the nipple. These are signs that he is preparing to latch on.Help your baby approach your breast ‘nose to nipple’ with their chin on or close to the breast and their head tipped back a little.  It’s surprising how far away from your nipple your baby’s mouth seems to be to achieve a good latch. As they latch on they will take a big mouthful of breast.Baby is nose to nipple, leading with the chinTheir lower jaw will be tucked into your breast well away from the base of your nipple and their nose will be free.  Keep their body tucked in close as they attach and feed but don’t push the back of their head— they needs to be able to move their head freely.Baby is supported at the shoulders. The back of their neck is freeTo help them swallow comfortably check their head is inline with their body, not turned to one side.  Once your baby is attached, settle back for comfort and pull your baby’s whole body in close.The natural or laid-back breastfeeding positions shown in the following video can be a great help in encouraging your baby to latch on well, as well as being comfortable for you. You can lean back comfortably with your baby on top of you with their whole front against you and their body completely supported by yours:This video demonstrates how to enable your baby to latch deeply on to your breast. This will help breastfeeding be comfortable for you and means your baby get enough milk:First breastfeedsBreastfeed early and often after your baby’s birth to minimise engorgement (uncomfortably swollen breasts). If he latches on well and you are comfortable he will get plenty of practice and will probably continue to feed well after your milk ‘comes in’ and your breasts feel fuller. If feeding is uncomfortable, seek help immediately.Later onMothers often say it takes a few weeks for breastfeeding to feel totally comfortable and natural, even if they have breastfed before. And as your baby grows in length and weight you’ll need to adjust how you support them. However you sit or lie, try to keep their whole front firmly against yours in a position that encourages them to extend their neck and sink their chin and lower lip firmly into your breast as they latch. Relax back a little and let your body support more of their weight. You baby’s bottom can rest on your hip or be pulled in against you with your elbow.CHINSMany people now use the nmemonic CHINS to help with comfortable breastfeedingC = close:Baby is ascloseto you as possible so that it does not need to reach for the breast.H = head:Baby’sheadis tilted so that the baby has its head at the right angle so the breast enters the mouth at the right angle to reach the comfortable place where your nipple will not be damaged.I = In Line:Your baby’s body isin a linefrom, head to shoulders and hips (you would not drink a cup of tea with it sitting on your shoulder!)N= Nose to nipple: This means baby is lifting up to the breast and the nipple is in the right place to enter the mouth comfortably This means you can then bring your baby in to the breast quickly to latch.

You can also find support and encouragement from breastfeeding mothers in yourlocal LLL group.If your baby won’t breastfeedDon’t panic! Some babies take a while to get around to nursing and by keeping your baby in skin-to-skin contact you are encouraging them to start feeding. A baby usually starts to suck spontaneously if they can snuggle up close to your bare chest for periods of time. Laid-back or natural breastfeeding positions usually stimulate a baby’s instinct to attach and suckle well at the breast. In such positions, babies can also latch on when sleepy or in light sleep. Watch for signs that your baby is stirring and gently encourage feeding.  See alsoMy Baby Won’t Breastfeed.And you may also find this article helpful:Getting breastfeeding back on track after a difficult birth.Supporting your breast?Your breast needs to rest at its natural level. If supporting it with your hand, keep your fingers well back from the areola and don’t be tempted to lift your breast and push it into your baby’s mouth. Sometimes shaping your breast slightly to match the oval of their mouth can help. Or experiment with the reclining positions shown here as these reduce the need to hold your baby leaving you with both hands free to help them latch.Written by Sue Upstone, Amanda Dunbar and mothers of LLLGB.Photos courtesy of Lois Rowlands, Suzanne Tobin and others who have kindly allowed us to use their photos.Further readingPositioning and attachmentBeginning Breastfeeding – easy readInverted Nipples?My baby won’t breastfeedNipple painGetting breastfeeding back on track after a difficult start – the three keepsBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Do I need to stop breastfeeding?There is no need to stop breastfeeding when you return to work. Returning to paid work doesn’t prevent you from breastfeeding your baby. Depending on the nature of your job and the age of your baby, you’ll probably need to adjust your nursing relationship. You’ll also need to talk to your employer, but time away from your little one doesn’t mean breastfeeding has to end. Continuing to nurse may be even more important to you both as you adjust to big changes in your lives.  Mothers choose to continue breastfeeding for their babies’ health and because breastfeeding is good for the whole family. It provides easy feeding on days at home and a warm way to reconnect at the end of a long day for mother and child. It’s well worth planning how to balance breastfeeding with your work routine.Why is breastfeeding so important?Your milk alone is vital to your baby during the first six months of life, and continues to be an important part of his diet until 12 months and beyond. Formula just doesn’t compare. As well as meeting nutritional needs, breastmilk is packed with antibodies—particularly important if your little one will be spending time in nursery or with a childminder. And when you are together, making time to reconnect through snuggling up and nursing will be even more meaningful. You’ll miss each other when you’re apart.But won’t it be a hassle?Being a working mother will be challenging, but breastfeeding can make life easier. Ending the breastfeeding relationship may appear at first to be the simplest solution, but with the increased risk of illness, plus the effort involved in buying, preparing and storing formula, weaning may ultimately be the real hassle. Also consider that your baby will eventually outgrow the need to nurse. Most mothers reduce and stop pumping before their babies stop breastfeeding.What are my options?Your options depend on the age of your baby and the nature of your job. You can start planning before your baby is born. Gather ideas from any co-workers who breastfed their babies. Studies show that the longer you wait before returning to work, the easier the transition will be for both you and your baby.Consider your employment flexibility andworkday practicalities:Can you extend your maternity leave, request part-time or flexible working hours, or an extended lunch hour?Are you able to work from home for all or some of the time, or even bring your baby to work?Can you break up your working week, perhaps working alternate days, so your baby is not away from you several days in a row?Shorter workdays may be easier to manage, with less pumping for you and fewer missed breastfeeds for your baby.Or you may prefer fewer but longer workdays, with more full days at home with your baby.Choose childcare carefullyHaving your baby nearby may allow you to go and nurse him during your lunch hour. Or maybe someone could bring him to you? Look for carers who are supportive of and knowledgeable about breastfeeding. It’s important they respect your decision to provide only your milk for your baby.Consider expressing your milkYou can use a good quality electric pump or learn to hand express. This is especially important if your baby is less than a year old.Expressing milkwill enable you to maintain milk production as well as ensuring your baby can still receive your milk whilst you’re apart. If you decide not to express your milk at work you can still continue breastfeeding when you’re at home. You may need to express at first to avoid the discomfort of engorgement and the risk ofmastitis.Solid foodsOnce your baby is eating more solid foods, he will need less expressed milk while you are away. But your baby will enjoy your yummy milk once you get home again!Making it workI don’t want to wean, but I’m sure my employer will want me to!This is one time when your employer can’t tell you what to do! Daunting as it may seem, it’s important to tell your employer about your need to express milk for your baby. Depending on what is available in your workplace, you may find it helpful to speak to someone from the human resources department, a health and safety representative and/or your trade union representative before speaking to your line manager. Employers are legally required to do a health and safety risk assessment for breastfeeding mothers, so you’ll need to notify them in writing a few weeks before you return to work. Explain that being able to pump regularly will reduce any risk of you becoming engorged and developing mastitis.Research shows it’s a win-win situation if breastfeeding is supported and therefore continues: you’ll feel positive about your company and your job satisfaction will increase—along with your willingness to work hard! Your employer will gain from your hard work and, because your baby will have breastmilk’s infection protection, you’re likely to take less time off.For more information on your rights, and what employers are required to do to support you, see:Maternity Action and their guidance on Breastfeeding at WorkACAS: accommodating breastfeeding in the workplaceThe Health & Safety Executive: Protecting pregnant workers and new mothersSomewhere to expressYou’ll want to request somewhere private to express your milk, preferably with a door that can be locked. It helps to have access to electricity for your pump, a fridge and running water. A comfortable place to sit and a table for your pump and other supplies are also important. Bathrooms and toilets are not suitable. Employers are legally required to provide suitable facilities for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to “rest”. Although, they are not required by law to provide a private and safe place to express andstore milk, the Health and Safety Executive recommend that they do. All employers must carry out a risk assessment so it would be very difficult for them to refuse.  Be very clear about what you want to do and what you need. And do point out that expressing is something that, depending on the age of your baby, you may only need to do for a few months.Before you return to workAttendLLL meetingsto meet other breastfeeding mothers in your area. You can offer each other vital support when breastfeeding, pumping, mothering or working becomes challenging.Practise pumping or hand expressing to learn what works for you. You can freeze the small amounts of milk you collect to use for your first few days back at work and to give you a small back-up supply. Once you’re missing feeds, the amount of milk you can pump will incre se and your baby can have fresh milk from the previous workday. Fresh milk retains more nutrients and immune factors.Wait to introduce a bottle until just before you start back to work. Making breastfeeding a priority while you are at home will help you avoid feeding problems. An older baby may never need a bottle. Milk can be given in a cup or mixed with solid food.Make your return to work easier by starting back on a Thursday or Friday. At the weekend, rest and prepare for any challenges you didn’t anticipate. Make changes if your first strategy doesn’t suit you or your baby.ExpressingIt’s usually best toexpress milkat least every three hours while you are away from your baby. You may need to pump or express your milk more frequently at first so you don’t feel uncomfortably full or start to leak. Be sure to include commuting time when deciding how often to pump. If you feel the tingling of your milk beginning to flow, pressing hard on your nipples for several seconds can prevent leaking. This can be done discreetly by crossing your arms tightly across your chest and pressing firmly on your nipples with the palms of your hands. Hold for a few seconds before releasing and all should be well. If it doesn’t work first time, try again for a little longer. But bear in mind that if your breasts feel full, this is a sign you need to express some milk. With time you’ll have fewer problems with leaking.Working and breastfeedingIt can be so rewarding to continue to nurse your baby after returning to work. It’s a wonderful way of reconnecting after a day apart. LLL meetings can continue to be a good source of support after you return to work. If you’re unable to attend everymeeting, yourlocal LLL Leadercan still listen to any concerns you have and offer support.Written by Sue Upstone & Mothers of LLLGB.Further readingWorking and BreastfeedingWorkday practicalitiesIf you leave your babyWhen mum can’t be thereExpressing your breastmilkHand expression of breastmilkMy Journey Returning To Work, a mother’s storyMothers on … breastfeeding & workBooksThe Womanly Art of BreastfeedingLLLI. London: Pinter & Martin, 2010.Exclusively Pumping BreastmilkStephanie Casemore.

"Combining motherhood with paid employment is a challenge—but continuing to breastfeed can make it easier. Stopping breastfeeding increases your baby’s risk of illness, and the effort involved in buying, preparing and storing formula can be a major hassle.

This is good if you’re paid by the hour and will keep your employer happy too!Your breastmilk is FREE so that saves you money.You will miss your baby. How good to connect with him during the working day, whether you express milk for him or get the chance to breastfeed.Your baby will miss you. How lovely to have precious nursing time together at home. If you feel guilt or conflict about returning to work, continuing to breastfeed will help you feel you’re stilldoing the very best you can for your little one.Returning to work will be hard work whichever way you feed your baby. Sitting down to breastfeed lets you rest and recharge.The evening beforePrepare the day before to help mornings go smoothly—pack your baby’s nappy bag, make a packed lunch, prepare your pump and check that everyone’s clothes are ready.Getting outSet your alarm for a feed just before you get up, so your baby is content while you dress and get ready. Then nurse him again just before you leave. You’ll start the day with comfortable breasts and your baby well-fed.Coming homeIf possible, breastfeed as soon as you collect your baby. When you get home, plan to have a drink and a snack and nurse or play with your baby for a while.  Lying down to nurse and even having a nap may help you cope with the evening rush. Cuddles and a chat over a snack can also help you reconnect with older children. Everyone will be happier if you and your baby are more relaxed, even if dinner ends up a little later.TearsBabies and children often save up their frustrations until the person they trust most is available. It’s normal for a baby to fuss and cry more than usual when his mother collects him. Accepting your baby’s emotions is usually more helpful than trying to force independenceCommon concernsLeakingPump at work and breastfeed frequently at home to keep up your milk production.  After any non-working days when you’ve been nursing your baby, you will probably experience more leaking and be able to pump more milk. If you feel the tingling of your milk letting down, fold your arms tightly across your chest and press firmly on your nipples for several seconds to stop milk flow. Some breast pads also work this way to prevent leaking. But full breasts are a sign to express some milk.  You’ll probably have fewer problems with leaking after a few days at work, but be able to pump less milk. It’s also common to be able to express more milk in the morning than in the afternoon.Blocked ductsListen to your body. To avoid problems with blocked ducts and mastitis, express frequently enough to keep your breasts soft and comfortable while you are away from your baby. Full breasts reduce milk production.Nurse often when togetherThe more often your baby gets to nurse when you are together, the less milk you’ll need to pump when away. Be prepared for more evening, night-time and early morning feeds—this reverse-cycle nursing is common. If you keep your baby with you in the evening they can nurse frequently before bed and you may get fewer night-time awakenings.Co-sleepingFor part or all of the night can make it easier to sleep whilst meeting your baby’s need for closeness.Boosting milk productionKeep an emergency supply of frozen expressed breastmilk. Take prompt steps to increase your milk production if you need to dip into your supply. A ‘babymoon’ day, afternoon or evening with your baby, resting and breastfeeding frequently, can really boost your milk supply. Be aware that medications such as decongestants and the contraceptive pill can lower milk production. You may also notice a temporary drop in milk during your menstrual periods.  If your baby is over six months it can help if the caregiver gives them any solid foods and other drinks whilst you are away, as this may reduce the amount of milk you need to pump. You can then concentrate on nursing when you’re at home.FatigueYour biggest problem will probably be tiredness.Getting enough rest and early nights can help you cope. Use days at home to recharge—take things slowly and have an afternoon nap if needed.Use breastfeeding and pumping sessions as rest times—a chance to sit or lie down and relax.Find ways to take short breaks during your day, using any unexpected opportunities.Establish priorities for what needs doing at home and share responsibilities with your partner, older children and others.Pace yourself, and reserve your time and energy for the most important tasks.Try to fit in a little fresh air and exercise such as a regular walk. Some errands may be nearly as quick on foot as by car.Regular mealsEating regular and nutritious meals will help sustain you. Drink according to your thirst. Avoid using caffeine drinks (coffee, tea, cola) to keep you going.Reducing stressRunning late is a common cause of stress. If you leave home in plenty of time to get to your caregiver’s, you can spend a few minutes settling and nursing your baby before leaving for work. Consider having a flexible arrangement with your caregiver in case you run late at the end of the day. Paying for 15 minutes extra childcare may reduce your stress levels, even if you rarely use it.  Plan backup childcare options in case your baby is ill. You or your partner may have to take a day’s leave, one of you may have to work from home, or your baby could go to family or a friend whom he knows well.When you feel overwhelmedRemember that what you are going through is because you are a working mother. It’s work that’s tiring—  breastfeeding makes being a mother easier. Developing a support network of like-minded mothers gives you people to turn to when needed.  The hardest part of returning to work is missing your baby. Be kind to yourself, especially when you start back. Nursing, carrying your baby in a sling or backpack and sleeping with him nearby can all help you compensate for the time apart.Many of the challenges you’ll experience are shared with all mothers, including getting necessary jobs done with a crawling baby or active toddler. Being flexible will help you cope with what each day brings when your baby is into everything.  Avoid doing everything at home in addition to your paid job. Discuss with your partner  and older children how the jobs at home can be more equally shared. Use this as chance for everyone to learn new skills and become more independent.“Breastfeeding simplifies many things for me, plus it helps to ensure that when I am at home, I am spending time with my baby.”Make time for yourselfMake time to relax and enjoy your favourite hobbies. Use your baby’s nursing or nap times to give you a chance to read, play music or do a craft. A sling or backpack can also help for gardening or other activities you enjoy. Babies and toddlers can play close by too and may enjoy watching or joining in with your interesting activities.Keep breastfeeding options openOnce back at work, you can always make changes if you find things aren’t working out as planned. However, if you decide to stop breastfeeding before you return to work, it can be difficult to reverse this decision later on.Breastfeeding doesn’t last foreverAt some point your baby will outgrow the need to nurse. And well before then you will be able to reduce and stop expressing milk whilst away. You will both benefit physically and emotionally from ending breastfeeding gradually.LLL meetingscan continue to be a good source of support after you return to work. If you’re unable to attend every meeting, yourlocal LLL Leadercan still listen to any concerns you have and offer support.Written by Sue Upstone and mothers of LLLGB.Further ReadingExpressing your milkIf you leave your babyStoring your milkWhen mum can’t be thereWorking and breastfeedingYou can buy this information in printed form from our shophereYou may also wish to look at the following guidance:Maternity Action and their guidance on Breastfeeding at WorkACAS: accommodating breastfeeding in the workplaceThe Health & Safety Executive: Protecting pregnant workers and new mothers",https://laleche.org.uk/workday-practicalities/,Workday Practicalities
"“Mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural and effective way of understanding and satisfying the needs of the baby.” – La Leche League InternationalNature intended mothers and babies to stay together as much as possible because breastfeeding is the normal way to care for a baby – providing him with the comfort and security of his mother’s presence as well as with milk. It also helps protect him from any infections he may come into contact with. Babies and separation“In the early years the baby has an intense need to be with his mother, which is as basic as his need for food.”–La Leche League InternationalA breastfed baby’s ‘primary attachment figure’ is likely to be his mother. Separation from her will be distressing for him unless he is in the care of another person with whom he has already formed an attachment, such as a family member or friend. Being left with a stranger, however kind and caring that person may be, is frightening for a young child. Many babies and toddlers show distress at separation by becoming upset or misbehaving. Others become quiet, withdrawn or may sleep a lot.It’s important to know that a quiet baby is suppressing his emotions and is in need of intensive care and attention just as much as a baby who cries or protests his distress. These behaviours are less likely when a baby knows and trusts his carer. Before a baby you will be caring for is left with you, allow as much time as possible for him to form an attachment to you whilst still in the presence of his mother. Once the baby has got to know you, the next step could be you caring for him for a short time and, when he is comfortable with this, long enough for him to be offered a single feed. A breastfed baby is more likely to allow someone else to feed him if his mum isn’t present.Breastfeeding ConsiderationsFood and DrinkSleepCaring for the Breastfed BabyExpressed BreastmilkFeeding OptionsHow much milk?How often?ReassuranceInfant formulaIf bottles are usedAlso tryBreastfeeding ConsiderationTry to keep separation as short as possible at first, especially for a very young baby. It helps if the baby’s mother can nurse just before she leaves and immediately she returns. A full baby and comfortable breasts make for a good start. Avoid offering a large amount of milk or other foods shortly before a baby’s mother is due to return – a mum will probably need to feed her baby as soon as she arrives if her breasts are feeling full. Breastfeeding is the perfect way for mother and baby to reconnect after time apart. There are huge benefits if a mother can see and nurse her baby part-way through longer separations. For the mother, it reduces her need to express milk while she’s away and she may not leak as much. Her baby will benefit from contact with his mum and need fewer feeds while he’s with you, making looking after him easier.Food and DrinkBreastfed babies are often very good at moderating their intake of food and drink and not taking more than they need. A happy baby is more likely to take any food and drink that is available than go hungry or thirsty. If a baby is eating solid foods, this will help if he is reluctant to take much expressed breastmilk. Many foods contain water, especially fruits. It’s also possible to offer expressed milk mixed with solid foods. Some babies are happier to take a drink if it is given with solids, so a drink with a small snack may be an option in between mealtimes. Bear in mind that current guidelines recommend that healthy full term babies are not offered solid foods until around six months of age. Nowadays mothers often allow their babies to feed themselves instead of spoon-feeding them.SleepBreastfed babies often fall asleep at the breast, and may find it difficult to go to sleep alone. Mothers may encourage their babies to sleep when they need to rather than having set times for naps. Being cuddled and rocked, carried in a sling or perhaps taken for a walk in a pushchair can help a baby ease into sleep when he’s showing signs of tiredness.Caring for the Breastfed BabyA baby can be offered breastmilk in several ways depending on his age, what he finds comfortable and his mother’s preferences. Many breastfed babies never have a bottle – even when separated from their mothers.Expressed BreastmilkA mother’s own milk is the best possible food to help her baby grow and develop and is full of antibodies, live cells, and other substances to protect him from infection.Expressed breastmilkis remarkably resilient and stores well due to its antibacterial properties. Comprehensive information on how to store breastmilk is available on our pagehere.Feeding OptionsUsing either an open cup or a baby beaker with a simple spout (no valves) is an option for a baby from three months old. A younger baby can be fed his mother’s milk using a small flexible plastic cup, medicine cup or spoon filled half-full. Swaddle the baby in a blanket if needed and hold him upright in your lap. Rest the cup gently on his lower lip and tip it so a small amount of milk touches his lips. This will encourage him to extend his tongue to lap the milk. Don’t pour milk into his mouth. Leave the cup in position as he swallows, then offer again. Let the baby set the pace, lapping the milk. An oral/medicine syringe (ask for one in your local pharmacy) can also be used to drip milk slowly into his mouth just inside his lower lip or gum, so he has chance to taste then swallow without choking.How much milk?It’s difficult to determine how much milk to expect a breastfed baby to take when separated from his mother. Much will depend on his age, how well-fed he is beforehand and for how long he is left. If you care for a baby regularly you will soon get a good idea of how much he usually takes. There’s evidence that fully breastfed babies require less milk than formula fed babies—as much as 25% fewer calories at four months. Most breastfed babies take between 60–120ml (2–4oz) about 8 to 10 times per day. It’s unlikely that a breastfed baby would take 240ml (8oz) of breastmilk at one feed.  It can be useful to tell the mother how much milk the baby takes so she can leave enough milk next time. Don’t be surprised if the baby doesn’t drink much milk whilst in your care. A baby may adapt to his mother’s working hours, taking very little milk from his caregiver and then nursing very frequently when his mum is around and this is perfectly normal.How Often?If you’re used to feeding babies to a routine, learning about feeding cues may help. Fussing, rooting and fist sucking are all early signs of hunger. A nursing baby is used to feeding frequently so offer his mother’s milk quickly, before he gets frantic with hunger—little and often works well for most breastfed babies.ReassuranceA nursing mum and baby will find it hard to be apart from one another. The separation will be so much easier on both if the baby has formed an attachment to you and his mother knows she can trust that you’ll do your best to meet his needs whilst she’s away.Infant formulaIf the baby’s mother leaves powdered infant formula, you need to follow NHS guidelines for its preparation carefully, as it is not a sterile product. The NHS leaflet, Bottle feeding, provides information on making up each formula feed fresh using water at 70°C. Cool the bottle of formula to body temperature before giving it to the baby. Anything used to give infant formula needs to be washed in hot, soapy water and sterilised so artificial feeding is as safe as possible. Never give infant formula to a baby without his mother’s permission. Infant formula, given when not essential to meet a baby’s nutritional needs can encourage an unnecessary end to breastfeeding. It can also put a baby’s health at risk and may have social and financial implications. Whilst a decision to stop breastfeeding is reversible, the practicalities of re-lactation aren’t always easy. NHS leaflet: Bottle feeding is available from health visitors and online at:Unicef – Resources for Parents – DoH Bottle Feeding LeafletIf bottles are usedBottles can confuse breastfed babies, as nursing at the breast is different from sucking a bottle. Once breastfeeding is well established this is less likely to be a problem, though some breastfed babies will not take a bottle. The following tips can help a breastfed baby take a bottle with the least effect on breastfeeding.Choose a teat with a small hole to help prevent the baby being overwhelmed with milk.Offer a bottle before he is too hungry. Watch for early feeding cues.Cuddle him in a fairly upright position, supporting his neck and head if needed.Encourage the baby to open wide by placing the teat across his upper and lower lips and with its tip at the ridge between the upper lip and nose.Give him some control by allowing him to take the bottle teat into his mouth himself.Avoid just pushing the teat in.Tip the bottle just enough to give a gentle flow so the baby is not overwhelmed with milk. As the bottle empties, gradually tip the bottle more.Encourage frequent pauses to mimic breastfeeding by tilting the bottle just enough to stop the flow. Allow the baby to decide when he has had enough. Different feeding positions can help:Holding the baby in his usual nursing position.Supporting him against your raised legs.Holding him with his back to your chest.Also tryWrapping him in something that smells of mum.Moving rhythmically – rocking, walking, or swaying from side-to-side while feeding him.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of LLLGB.

"When a mother is ill, it affects the whole family. For a breastfeeding mother, there are additional concerns about how her illness may affect her baby, whether directly because of any medication she needs to take, or indirectly if the illness makes it more difficult for her to feed and care for her baby.Balancing risksMedications and breastmilkCommon illnessesLess common conditionsHospitalisationHaving surgery?AnaestheticsRecoveryIf weaning is advisedBalancing risksWhilst there may be a risk if you continue to breastfeed while taking a medication, it’s important to be well informed about the medication and to balance these with the risks of stopping breastfeeding — even temporarily. Substituting infant formula can be risky for a baby as it will deprive him of the antibodies and immune factors that help protect him from illness. Where there is a family history of allergy a baby may have an increased risk of developing asthma or eczema when exposed to infant formula.For a breastfed baby nursing is more than just food — it’s love and comfort too. So caring for your baby and keeping him happy without being able to breastfeed is likely to be difficult for everyone concerned. And if abrupt weaning causes overfull breasts, blocked ducts or mastitis, this will compound your problems.Medications and breastmilkGenerally, a medication that is safe for babies is the best choice for a breastfeeding mother. In any case, watching for any side effects in a baby is always a sensible precaution.Usually, when a mother takes a medication, her baby receives a much smaller amount through breastfeeding than he would during pregnancy. However, medications that are considered safe during pregnancy may not necessarily be compatible with breastfeeding. A pregnant mother’s liver and kidneys may detoxify and excrete a medication before it reaches her baby through the placenta. After birth a breastfed baby must process the medication on his own once it has reached his bloodstream.Many medications can safely be taken by breastfeeding mothers. Some medications don’t pass into a mother’s milk, some are not absorbed from a baby’s digestive tract, and for some there is a long history of safe use by nursing mothers. However, it’s wise to check with your doctor or pharmacist as certain medications can cause problems.Consider the following points when making decisions:Premature and newborn babies are the most likely to be affected by medications. After one month of age most babies are better able to handle certain medications.A heavier baby will be less affected by a medication he receives through his mother’s milk than a lighter baby of the same age.A baby who is receiving solid foods or formula as well as breastmilk will probably receive less of the medication than one who is exclusively breastfeeding. A breastfeeding toddler who nurses infrequently will receive less of the medication than a toddler who nurses more often.A medication taken for weeks or months may have a greater potential impact on a breastfed baby than one that is taken for only a few days.The level of a medication in a mother’s milk can vary according to the time between taking the medication and the next breastfeed.It is always wise to check over-the counter medications. Although paracetamol and ibuprofen are considered compatible with breastfeeding some medications, like aspirin, are not safe for babies. Others, such as cold and flu remedies, can cause sleepiness and reduce your milk production. Medications with only one active ingredient may be a better choice than compound medications.For up-to-date information on medications when breastfeeding, see theDrug FactSheets from the Breastfeeding Network.Health concerns and illnessesAn LLL Leader can help you find more information on breastfeeding with particular illnesses and health conditions, and support you as you consider options.Common illnessesCommon colds, flu and stomach bugs can be hard to cope with while breastfeeding— particularly if you don’t feel like eating. Even if you can’t eat, try to keep up your fluid intake to prevent dehydration. You will continue to make milk for your baby, though if you feel very ill it may seem as though you are producing less milk. Continuing to breastfeed whenever your baby is interested will help maintain milk production while you are ill and increase it afterwards if needed.There is no need to stay apart from your baby—he will already have been exposed to the illness before you realised you were ill. Continuing to breastfeed gives him valuable protection against the effects of your illness. Sensible hygiene precautions such as using tissues and binning them immediately, and washing hands with soap and water or using hand cleansers can help reduce transmission of illness.Less common conditionsIf you have contracted a less common illness, such as chickenpox, impetigo or Herpes simplex you will want to know how it will affect you and your baby. Your midwife, health visitor, GP or hospital consultant can give you detailed medical information about your illness and how to minimize risks of transmission.Mental health concernsSince mothers often experience depression, a lot of information is available on medications and breastfeeding. It is usually possible to find appropriate treatment that can be taken while breastfeeding. With prompt treatment mothers recover quite quickly and are then able to fully enjoy parenting their new baby. And breastfeeding helps maintain the important bond between mother and baby even if a mother is depressed.Chronic health concernsIf you have a chronic health condition or illness, such as asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy or thyroid disease, you may have concerns about how – or if – this will affect your feeding preferences. In most cases, with the right support and information, breastfeeding is possible. You may even find that nursing is the simplest way to feed your baby.If you choose to breastfeed your baby – including exclusively expressing or combi feeding – LLL Leaders are available to support you by listening to your needs and your baby’s needs. We can help you to find breastfeeding solutions which work for you and make decisions that are right for you and your family.Contact your local Leader (breastfeeding counsellor) or LLL grouphere.HospitalisationIf you need to spend time in hospital you will naturally have concerns about separation from your baby. First consider whether the treatment could be delayed until your baby is older, or takeplace with you as an outpatient. Explain to your health care professionals that not being able to breastfeed or express milk will put you at risk of painfully overfull breasts, blocked ducts, mastitis and a reduction in your milk production and ask for access to your baby or to a pump to be written into your careplan.Having surgery?Make clear to your partner and health care team on the day that if you are not alert enough to breastfeed after the operation they will need to help you express your milk. If you can’t keep your baby with you whilst in hospital, ask that your partner or whoever is looking after your baby be able to bring your baby in before and after the procedure so you can breastfeed. This is likely to be much easier and more restful for you than expressing.Hope for the best—plan for the worstEven if you can breastfeed in hospital, planning for the possibility that you might not will help you cope. If you are going to be apart from your baby, you’ll need to make arrangements to express your milk. It may not be easy to gain regular access to hospital pumps so it’s a good idea to learn to hand express and/or take in your own or a rented pump. If the pump requires electricity, the hospital electricians may be required to test it for safety before you can plug it in. For a planned hospital stay ask to have it tested in advance. You might also practice expressing beforehand.Your baby’s needsYour baby will miss you so if you know you will be apart, try to find a carer whom your baby already knows and loves eg his daddy or a grandparent. If possible, express and freeze milk in the weeks beforehand so you have an emergency supply for your baby.AnaestheticsMedications used for local and general anaesthesia do not remain in a mother’s system or affect her milk. It is safe to breastfeed as soon as you are alert enough to handle your baby. For planned treatment ask in advance for detailed information on which drugs you will need to take and on pre-op procedures such as fasting. Request post-op pain relief medication that is compatible with breastfeeding. To help you cope with fasting prior to a medical procedure avoid tea, coffee and salty foods and eat well and drink plenty of water the day before. Don’t be surprised if you find it difficult to express much milk during the hours leading up to your operation. Afterwards, milk production will pick up very quickly with frequent breastfeeding.After any operation, try to organise as much help as possible with meals, household tasks etc. Depending on how you are feeling, you may even appreciate someone helping you care for your baby. Plan complete rest for the first 24 hours and then take things easy for at least a week.RecoveryThe important thing for any mother after any illness is taking time to recuperate. Be wary of trying to do too much too soon. Eating and drinking, rest and relaxation will help both your recovery and, combined with frequent nursing, your milk production.If your baby is fussy at the breast you may be concerned about whether you are making enough milk. Encourage your baby to breastfeed frequently and offer both sides to give your breasts the message to boost milk production—you’ll probably notice a difference within just a day or two. You may find breastfeeding while lying down lets you rest and nurse your baby. If you are groggy from medications, ask whoever is looking after you to help keep your baby safe. If you still don’t feel like eating much, try frequent small meals or snacks and sips of juice. Try a night-time snack and drink until your normal appetite returns.If weaning is advisedEnforced weaning is not easy on either mother or child so if you are told to stop  breastfeeding your baby because of a medical condition or medication, it’s normal to feel overwhelmed and upset. Do contact an LLL Leader to discuss the options—she can access information on individual medications if needed. Whilst each medication needs to be checked individually, many are compatible with breastfeeding. For a short course of treatment, temporary weaning may be an option. To minimize discomfort and maintain milk production you will need to express or pump your milk frequently instead of nursing, discarding it until your treatment is completed. You can then re-establish breastfeeding.Nursing is more than just a method of feeding. It’s also a familiar source of closeness and comfort. So if weaning really is necessary try to end breastfeeding as gradually as time allows, giving your baby lots of love and extra attention. You can hand express or use a pump to reduce your milk production gradually. This will help keep your breasts comfortable and slow down hormonal changes.

"“The newborn baby has only three demands. They are warmth in the arms of its mother, food from her breasts and security in the knowledge of her presence. Breastfeeding satisfies all three.”~ Dr Grantly Dick-Read fromBirthing Without FearThis simple recipe for keeping a baby happy works for the majority of breastfeeding families. But a few babies remain unhappy despite their parents’ efforts to meet their needs.It can be worrying if your baby is unsettled, uncomfortable, distressed or in pain. If he is being sick, experiencing diarrhoea or has other symptoms, this may add to your concerns. Babies can be unsettled for many reasons and it can sometimes take time and effort to work out the cause.You may worry that your baby’s symptoms are caused by something either of you has eaten. While it’s true that food allergy or intolerance could be the cause it is wise to consider other possibilities first. When your baby’s behaviour shows that something is not right it’s important to keep searching until you find a solution that makes both of you feel better.Hunger – or some other source?Comfort techniquesNot enough breastmilkOversupply or forceful flowThrush in a baby’s mouthReflux diseasePyloric stenosisDiarrhoea due to a stomach upsetLactose intoleranceCongenital disordersAllergy and food intoleranceHunger – or some other cause?Delaying or scheduling feeds will make most babies unhappy— responding to your baby’s fussiness by breastfeeding (offering both breasts if needed) and/or carrying him will ensure that he is comforted and not hungry. It is normal for a baby to want to nurse around 8–12 times each 24 hours.Comfort techniques for unhappy babiesIf your baby isn’t comforted by breastfeeding you may find carrying him in a sling or soft carrier helps. Research shows that babies who are carried more tend to cry much less. And even if your baby doesn’t settle, he will at least know that someone cares enough to be with him while he’s unhappy. Sometimes the colic hold can relieve abdominal discomfort.Care for an unhappy baby isn’t easy—try to minimize outside demands so you can concentrate on your baby’s needs. Enlist your partner’s support in taking care of you both—sometimes the difference can be just what is needed.SeeI think my baby’s got colicfor more information..The colic hold:The ‘colic hold’ can be useful for comforting an unhappy babyNot enough breastmilkYour baby could be fussy because he is not getting enough milk. In this case he may not show steady weight gain. As weekly weight gain can vary, average your baby’s weight gain over several weeks.Check he is well attached at the breast, and offer both breasts at least 8–12 times every 24 hours. Keep an eye on nappies too. After the first four days, expect at least 6–8 wet and 3–5 dirty nappies in 24 hours.  These should be yellow, loose unformed poos at least the size of a 2p coin. From about six weeks, some babies have less frequent but abundant poos.SeeIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?for more information.Oversupply or forceful flowWhen a mother is producing too much milk, her baby may often bring up milk, be very windy and want to nurse a lot. He may suffer with colic, and be fussy at the breast, arching away when the milk starts flowing. Rather than the typical yellow poos of a breastfed baby, his may be green and frothy—occasionally or all the time.With oversupply, a baby is likely to be gaining weight very fast, as much as 400g in a week. A baby coping with an oversupply of milk may mistakenly be diagnosed with lactose intolerance or reflux—but the problem can be overcome by attention to positioning and attachment, and by ensuring that he takes a full feed from one breast before switching to the other.SeeToo much milk and oversupplyfor more information.Thrush in baby’s mouthA baby may have thrush in his mouth. Mothers can also have painful nipple thrush. The main symptoms are fussy nursing because of a sore mouth and sore, itchy, burning nipples. A baby may  also have nappy rash.Thrush can cause windiness and slow weight gain because a baby doesn’t nurse as well as usual. When a mother or baby takes antibiotics, their risk of thrush increases.SeeThrushfor more information.Reflux diseaseA baby with gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has a weakness in the tissue around the opening between the oesophagus and the stomach, allowing the stomach contents to move back up into his throat. Symptoms include vomiting, colicky crying and sudden waking at night.Because babies with reflux often associate food with pain, refusal to nurse and slow weight gain are common. Reflux is more common and severe in babies who are not breastfed.SeeRefluxfor more information.Pyloric stenosisThis is a narrowing of the muscular wall of the tube between the stomach and small intestine. The symptoms of pyloric stenosis generally appear between 2 and 6 weeks with increasing frequency of possetting, or projectile vomiting, along with poor weight gain.If projectile vomiting occurs every day consult your doctor, as your baby may need medication or even surgery to resolve the problem.Diarrhoea due to a stomach upsetA baby or toddler with diarrhoea due to illness has 12–16 watery, smelly poos per day, which have no substance. A baby may also have other signs of illness, including fever or vomiting. Even after the illness is over, a baby or toddler who is otherwise well can have continuing diarrhoea, with loose poos, while his gut heals.If your baby has diarrhoea it is important to continue breastfeeding, offering frequent, small feeds.Lactose intoleranceLactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose (milk sugar), not an allergy to milk, though it can have similar symptoms. Lactose intolerance occurs when an individual doesn’t make enough lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose in the intestine.Although it can occur in adults, lactose intolerance is very rare in young children. This makes sense as breastmilk, the food on which they depend, is extremely rich in lactose. In populations in which lactose intolerance is common, the ability to produce lactase generally declines gradually and symptoms increase gradually over many years. This sort of lactose intolerance does not occur before weaning age, which is considered to be between 2 and 4 years.Allergy and food intoleranceIf you have ruled out most of the obvious causes and your baby is still colicky, unhappy or experiencing dry and itchy skin, you may start to wonder whether your breastfed baby could be reacting to something in his diet or environment or, if he is exclusively breastfed, something in your diet.Starting solids and adding nutritional supplements, fruit juice or other baby drinks to your baby’s diet may trigger allergy symptoms. Once you start offering solids keep an eye out for any food he might be reacting to and avoid it for a while. Sometimes, a baby will react to a food his mother eats or a supplement she takes. Cow’s milk protein is one of the most common allergens.SeeAllergies and Food Intolerancesfor more information.Congenital disordersIn extremely rare cases, a baby is born with a congenital metabolic disorder such as ‘galactosaemia’ which affects the ability to digest and use lactose.Symptoms in a baby are obvious in the first few days as lactose in the mother’s milk increases. These may include dehydration, severe jaundice, illness, persistent vomiting and very poor weight gain. Medical tests may be needed to identify the cause of the problem so appropriate treatment can be given.Seek supportWhen you find yourself coping with a baby who is unhappy, your localLa Leche League groupcan be a great place to get practical and moral support. You may well find others there who have had similar experiences. An LLL Leader will be able to access more detailed information on specific conditions, if needed.Written by Sue Cardus and mothers of LLLGB.

"Nobody likes to disturb a sleeping baby, but sometimes a baby can be too sleepy for their own good. At times like this they may need you to take action.Your newborn baby needs to nurse actively for one or both breast at each feed. Offer the second breast after they seem to have finished at the first, although they may not want both sides at every feed.What makes a baby sleepy?Recovering from birth:In the first few days, some babies are sleepy or uninterested in feeding. It’s especially true for small babies, after a difficult labour or birth, or if you received drugs for pain relief during labour.Jaundiceor an infection may make a baby sleepy. Newborn jaundice is normal but frequent breastfeeding helps prevent it becoming a problem.Not enough milk: Your baby may sleep to conserve energy if they are not getting enough food. They may also sleep longer that is good for them if they are apart from you.Is my baby too sleepy?To gain weight and stimulate your milk production, expect your newborn to:Breastfeed effectively at least 8–12 times in 24 hoursFeed actively from one or both breasts at each feed, swallowing regularly.Nurse at least every 2–3 hours from the start of one feed to the next, with one longer sleep of 4–5 hours.Have periods where they breastfeed on and off for several hours, usually in the evening.Gain weight from day 4 and regain birth weight by about two weeks.Look at our pageBeginning Breastfeedingfor more information. If your baby is too sleepy to do all these things they may need your active help to ensure they are nursing effectively and getting enough milk.Is my baby getting enough milk?A baby may lose up to 7% of their birth weight during the first few days. From around day 3-4, expect them to start gaining, and to regain their birth weight by 10-14 days. Many breastfed babies gain around 200-235g (7-8oz) as week for the first 2-3 months. If you baby consistently gains less, or they haven’t regained their birthweight by 14 days, seek skilled help to assess whether they are getting enough milk. What comes out is a sign of what has gone in, so counting dirty nappies can be a useful guide between weighing sessions. For more information to help you know if your baby is getting enough milk in the first few days, you could read our article here aboutsigns of effective feeding in the early days.And then after the first few days, this article will help you decideif your baby is getting enough milk.AgeDirty nappies per 24 hours1-2 Day1 or 2 greenish-black tarry meconium poos3-5 daysAt least 3 green transitional poos5+ daysAt least 3-5 yellow, loose unformed poos the size of a 2p coin or largerRemind your baby to nurseIf your baby is too sleepy or groggy to rouse themselves every few hours, you will need to wake them to feed to ensure they get enough milk.This will be easier if your baby is in a light sleep cycle: watch for rapid eye movements under their closed eyelids, arm and leg movements, sucking activity and changes in their facial expression.Aim for your baby to feed at least 10 times in 24 hours, including at least once at nightEncourage active nursing on the first breast, watching and listening for signs of swallowing.Use breast compression (see below) to keep your baby nursing actively.Offer the other side in the same way. You can switch back and forth several times if it helps your baby stay awake and feed.Encourage cluster nursing whenever your baby is more alert.Give expressed milk if they aren’t feeding well.Keep them close by—day and night—so they don’t sleep too long and you don’t miss their feeding cues.Also tryDimming the lights and keeping your surroundings quiet and peaceful.Keeping the room temperature at around 18°C or undressing your baby a little if the room is warm. Being too hot can make a baby sleepy.Unwrapping any blankets.Newborn feeding cuesSigns of interest in feeding include:Mouth movements; smacking or licking his lipsSucking on lips, tongue, hands, fingers, toes, toys or clothingRooting, head bobbing or nuzzling against whoever is holding themFidgting and squirming a lotFussingCrying – a late sign of hunger.Do offer feed generously.  A newborn won’t find it easy to feed well, if they have to wait and reached late hunger signs.Helping your sleepy babyPositioning and attachmentGetting a deep, comfortable latch is crucial. If your baby is not latched on well at the breast, they will have to work harder to get your milk. They may tire easily and fall asleep. Sometimes just a small adjustment to the way your baby comes to the breast can make a huge difference. An LLL Leader can provide individual suggestions tailored to your circumstances. If your breasts are engorged, gently hand express a little milk and/or ease swelling back with your fingertips to make it easier for your baby to latch on deeply and prevent you getting sore. See our longer article aboutPositioning and Attachmentfor more help on how to help your baby latch well, feed effectively and be comfortable for you.Copyright Suzanne TobinSeek skilled help early on if you are finding breastfeeding difficult or uncomfortable.Laid back breastfeedingTry letting your baby lie on your body with their chest and tummy against you as you recline at about 45 degrees. If they can snuggle up close to your chest for periods of time, even when sleepy or during light sleep, they will often instinctively seek the breast and attach deeply and comfotably even during light sleep. This can be done skin-to-skin or with you and your baby lightly clothed. Watch for signs your baby is stirring and gently encourage feeding. Spending time relaxing like this can make a real difference to how well your baby feeds and how much milk you make.  Our page onComfortable Breastfeedinghas more ideas.Breast compressionIf your baby starts to doze at the breast, this technique will help him breastfeed actively and take more milk.Cup your breast with your hand, near your chest wall, thumb opposite fingers in a C shape. Keep your hand well back from the nipple area.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, with their jaw moving all the way to his ear. When they stop swallowing, compress your breast firmly.  They probably start swallowing again. Hold it squeezed until they stop nursing actively, then release your hand.Rotate your hand around your breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast as needed. Go gently—this should not hurt.Switch nursingTry switching breasts at least two or three times during each feed—when your baby comes off the first breast on their own or when breast compression no longer keeps them breastfeeding actively.Express milk for your babyUntil your baby gets the hang of feeding you may need to do some work for your baby. If they aren’t latching at all, or is not feeding well and gaining weight, then expressing your milk will help establish milk production. The earlier you start, the sooner you’ll produce plenty of milk. Hand expression is often easiest at first but when your milk comes in combining hand expression with pumping can be most effective.Giving expressed milkFirst,encourage your baby to nurse at both breasts. Watch for swallowing and use breast compression an switch nursing until they stop drinking and start to doze.Next, give your baby expressed milk until they have had enough. (For more on how to give additional milk, our articlehere). Giving your  baby your expressed milk after breastfeeding can help them overcome sleepiness and feed more effectively next time.Then, once your baby has settled, express from both breasts switching back and forth and using compressions and hand expression to get the available milk. Store this milk in the fridge ready for the next feed.Aimto complete this process within about an hour.Avoid bottles and dummiesYou can give small amounts of expressed milk using a spoon, flexible feeding cup or syringe. If you decid to use bottles for larger amounts, you can give the bottle in a way that helps protect breastfeeding. For more information on ways to give your baby milk and bottles see our article onBottles and other tools. An alternative is to use a nursing supplement: this acts like a straw to deliver extra milk through a tube along your breast as your baby nurses, avoiding the need for bottles. Our articleNursing Supplementersexplains more.Don’t give up too soonIf your baby doesn’t respond quickly to your efforts to get him to breastfeed more often and more effectively, don’t give up. Keep your baby fed, Keep your supply protected and Keep your baby close. You may find our article onGetting breastfeeding back on trackafter a tricky start helpful.

"Mothering is about building relationships and nurturing the love and trust that enables babies and children to thrive. And mothering through breastfeeding is a normal, natural and effective way of doing this. Breastfeeding helps you nurture your relationship with your baby and meet their individual needs. It’s nature’s way of satisfying a baby’s need for food, love, comfort and connection.It can take time to learn what a baby needs. Some childcare experts promote strict routines for babies and young children. They claim that if a mother follows their rulebook, her baby will be perfectly content. But every baby is different. While we may feel reassured if our day follows a predictable pattern, strict routines for feeding and sleeping often fail to meet the needs of individual babies.Difficulties with routinesFull breasts slow down their rate of milk production, which may lead to:Problems caused by expressingBreastmilk: a balanced meal, a drink, a snackBreastfeeding: comfort and connection tooFrequent breastfeeds: day and nightOne breast or twoBreastfeeding patterns adjustFinding your own rhythms: a sense of freedomThink of breastfeeds as minor eventsExpect the unexpectedEstablishing helpful patternsBabies are little for such a short timeDifficulties with routinesSome babies will object strongly to an imposed routine that doesn’t meet their needs. Others are easy going, and give only subtle signals that a particular routine isn’t right for them. Early feeding cues include hand sucking, lip smacking, turning their head towards you, or fussing. Don’t wait until they are desperate—crying is a late sign of hunger. Trying to ‘stretch’ the gaps between feeds is hard work and stressful for you both and can reduce your baby’s overall intake of milk.A well-drained breast makes milk faster than a full one. Encourage your baby to nurse frequently enough to keep your breasts soft and comfortable.Full breasts slow down their rate of milk production, which may lead to:A baby gaining weight slowly or needing supplements to maintain adequate weight gain.A sleepy baby who needs to be roused and encouraged to breastfeed actively to get the food they need.Lengthy feeds.A fussy baby.Engorgement, blocked ducts or mastitis.Expressing milk (pumping) can cause problemsSome childcare experts advise pumping to keep milk supply one step ahead of a baby’s needs. However, expressing can interfere with the delicate balance that happens when your baby and body are in tune with each other. Making more milk than your baby needs increases your risk of mastitis. You may experience fast flow and/or oversupply causing your baby to gag, splutter or come on and off the breast. Your baby might also havecolicor be fussy.Breastmilk: a balanced meal, a drink, a snackJust like adults, babies feed irregularly—none of us eats the same amount at every meal, nor do we always follow a set timetable for eating and drinking. With easy access to the breast, babies will balance their intake of fluids, calories, proteins, fats and other nutrients so they receive exactly what they need. All that is usually needed is the confidence to let your baby take the lead.Breastfeeding: comfort and connection tooBreastfeeding isn’t just food and drink. It also helps you and your baby maintain that connection and closeness with each other. So when your baby is tired or unhappy or upset, theyinstinctively ask to nurse because it helps them regain a sense of rightness with the world. Many breastfeeding mothers say that the ability to calm and comfort a baby just by nursing is one of the main reasons for carrying on. It makes life easier and more peaceful for everyone.Frequent breastfeeds: day and nightYour baby needs to nurse frequently to establish and maintain your milk production, especially in the early weeks. While breastfeeds may be further apart in the morning, it’s very common for babies to nurse frequently (or ‘cluster feed’) in the evening.  Babies receive fattier milk when they nurse more often. Your baby is stocking up for the night and putting in their order for tomorrow! (See here for more on coping withFussy evenings with a newborn.)One breast or twoSometimes your baby will want one breast, at other times both. Your baby knows what they need—let them nurse actively from the first breast until they come off looking satisfied or sleepy. Then offer the second breast. After the first few months babies often become really efficient feeders—so don’t be surprised if they’ve finished in 10 minutes or so! Their nappy output and continuing weight gain will reassure you they are getting enough. (Is my baby getting enough milk?)Breastfeeding patterns adjustA baby’s growth rate and mother’s breast storage capacity will affect their nursing pattern. Even the weather can make a difference—a thirsty baby will probably nurse more in hot weather. When babies have growth spurts and seem extra hungry, most mothers find there’s no need to pump to keep up milk production—more frequent feeds will do the trick. Milk production quickly adapts to meet your baby’s needs and feeding patterns settle down within a few days.Finding your own rhythms: a sense of freedomCombining some predictability with flexibility can give you a sense of freedom and stop you feeling tied down. At first, life with a new baby can seem quite chaotic, but if you relax and observe your baby you will find gentle patterns emerging. You can build on these patterns, creating a daily rhythm to suit you both.Strict routines don’t necessarily make life easier for you.  Being tied to particular routines, nap-times and sleep places can  make getting out and about, visiting friends or taking holidays more complicated.Your needs and those of your baby will change with time and from day to day. Following your baby’s rhythms will help you meet their needs when they have has growth spurts or are ill. It will also give you confidence to adapt when necessary, for example for a doctor’s appointment or holiday travel arrangements. When your baby is attached toyou, rather than their routine, problems are less likely and you may feel more relaxed about managing the day.Think of breastfeeds as minor eventsJust as with your own tea-breaks, try thinking of feeds as minor and flexible events that fit in with everyday life rather than major events which have to be planned for.Expect the unexpectedWhatever your baby’s usual pattern is, there will always be times when they surprise you. They might sleep at a different time, sleep longer, or not at all. They might go longer between feeds, or suddenly want to feed more frequently. But there’s no need to panic—this is how babies are! We may never know the reason for such changes. Life will either settle back into the original pattern or a new one will establish itself. Your baby will continue to grow and surprise you over the coming years.Establishing helpful patternsMorning– Having a reasonably regular time and pattern for getting up and dressed can be a springboard for your day.Going out– Going out can help structure your day, entertain your baby and give you a sense of purpose. You can develop a routine for getting everyone fed, ready, and out of the house. Prepare what you’ll need the evening before if you need to get out early.Afternoon– Babies are often ready to have a sleep somewhere around the middle of the day. Babies are all different and patterns change as they grow and develop. Try to tune in to your own baby’s natural rhythms of feeding, alertness and sleep and adjust your activities to match them. A nap or a rest for yourself, too, can help boost your energy for the rest of the day.Night-time– A gentle evening routine, eg bath, rocking, singing and nursing can help a tired baby wind down to sleep. Watch for fussing, yawning and rubbing of eyes and start your wind down pattern promptly. Some babies are natural ‘night owls’, taking a late afternoon nap and being alert during the evening.Household tasks– Developing the ability to be ‘interruptible’ is a real help. Completing housework in small ‘bites’ while being prepared to pause and attend to children can be a successful way to meet everyone’s needs. Seeing the world through your baby’s eyes can help you slow down and enjoy the present rather than rushing to get things done. Mothering babies and young children is a full-time job—it’s ambitious to expect to be a cleaner, cook and gardener at the same time. Concentrate on essentials. Do those things you can do with a baby around and save really tricky jobs for times when you have help. It’s unlikely you’ll look back in years to come and wish you had done more housework!Babies are little for such a short timeYou can’t spoil a baby with love and attention. The easiest way to care for a baby is to accept and meet their need for closeness. Remember, you know your baby best; take the information, advice and the ideas that are helpful to you and ignore those suggestions that don’t feel right. You can develop rhythms and routines that are in tune with your needs, and those of your baby and family.For support in meeting your baby’s needs contact an LLL Leader by calling ourHelplineor visiting our website.

"A nipple shield is a thin, silicone teat that can be placed over a mother’s nipple and may help a baby who is having difficulty learning to breastfeed. Holes in the tip allow milk to flow into the baby’s mouth. A nipple shield can be used temporarily to help establish breastfeeding or in some cases to help ensure that breastfeeding continues. A shield provides a firm stimulus at the roof of a baby’s mouth where the soft and hard palate meet. This can help him suckle more effectively.If your baby is not nursing at all, or is nursing ineffectively despite improving attachment and  increasing milk flow, a nipple shield may help by providing a firmer stimulus in your baby’s mouth. A nipple shield may be a useful tool in some situations. When nothing else works, it can be a temporary way to establish and maintain breastfeeding.A nipple shield may be helpful ifYour baby is struggling to learn how to breastfeedYou have flat or inverted nipples, or very soft breasts as it can help maintain nipple shapeYour baby thrusts his tongue, has a retracted tongue or has neurological problemsYour baby was born prematurelyYour baby needs extra stimulus to prompt suckingIn these situations, a nipple shield canGive a baby the opportunity to learn to breastfeedAllow a baby who breastfeeds ineffectively to take more milk directly at the breast. This can be particularly helpful for premature babiesAvoid or reduce the need to express milk and use cups or bottlesHelp keep breastfeeding goingNot a magic solutionIt is very important to seek skilled help with positioning, attachment and any other problems if you are planning to use nipple shields or are already using them. Helping your baby get a deep latch at the breast is the key to effective and comfortable nursing with or without a nipple shield. A shield cannot correct underlying problems, especially those of sore and damaged nipples or low milk production. And if your baby is not attached well he may compress your nipple, causing damage and intense pain. When your baby latches on deeply at the breast he gets plenty of milk. Also, as you wean from the shield he will be able to adapt to breastfeeding effectively and comfortably without it.Source: United States Breastfeeding CommitteeEven with a nipple shield, your baby may still need help to learn to breastfeed well. Sometimes just a small adjustment to the way you hold your baby makes a big difference. You may find the suggestions and pictures inComfortable Breastfeedinghelpful. If you cannot get comfortable or breastfeeds are taking an hour or more,seek help from an LLL Leaderwho can give you personalised suggestions.Holding your baby in skin-to-skin contact can make a big difference too. With or without a shield, laid back or ‘natural’ breastfeeding positions (see above) can be a great help in encouraging your baby to latch on effectively, as well as being comfortable for you. You can either lie down or recline with your baby on top of you and with his whole front against you and his body completely supported by yours. Such positions also leave both your hands free to shape your breast and help him latch.If your baby won’t breastfeedDon’t panic! Some babies take time to learn. However, babies will often latch on and suckle spontaneously if they can snuggle up close to their mother’s bare chest for periods of time. Try letting your baby lie on your body as you recline so that both his chest and tummy are against you. This kind of contact, known asBiological Nurturing™, or laid back breastfeeding usually stimulates a baby’s instinct to attach and suckle well at the breast. In such positions, babies can also latch on when sleepy or even asleep. Watch for signs your baby is stirring and gently encourage feeding. If he is not breastfeeding  effectively or at all you will need to express your milk for him. This will help maintain your milk production while he learns to breastfeed. An LLL Leader can give you tips for effective milk expression.Is he getting enough milk?Offer frequent feeds and monitor wet and dirty nappies for evidence your baby is getting plenty of milk. His weight will need checking regularly—as often as every three days for premature babies. For more information seeIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Check your breastsAreas that aren’t being drained well may appear swollen, sore or red. Treat early signs of localised engorgement to avoid a blocked duct or mastitis.PracticalitiesType and fitModern nipple shields are made of clear ultra thin silicone. Different makes vary in flexibility. Some shields have a cut out section, but these may not stay in place as well as a full nipple shield. Full nipple shields do not bother babies or affect their breathing. Nipple shields come in different sizes but choice is limited. Both the width of the tip section and the shape of the flat part vary and you may need to experiment to find which size and shape you prefer. A comfortable fit is very important and some mothers need more than one size of nipple shield due to differences between their breasts.ApplyingStretching the shield onto the breast can help it stay in place. You can also moisten the shield’s edges or warm it with hot water to help prevent it moving. Turn the nipple shield almost inside out before applying it. Smooth it onto the breast, starting well away from the nipple in the area where your baby’s lower jaw will latch on. Stretch the shield over your breast, with the tip centred over your nipple. The nipple shield should be tight against your breast with your nipple extending into the tip. If necessary, you can express milk into the tip or drip expressed milk onto the outside to encourage your baby to latch on.Turning a nipple shield almost inside out before applying helps draw your nipple in. Put on your nipple and then smooth the edges onto your breast. (Photo J Fieth, LLLGB)CleaningIf you and/or your baby are in hospital, wash the nipple shield thoroughly in hot soapy water and sterilise it before each use. If you have a healthy, full-term baby and are at home, cleaning with hot soapy water or washing in a dishwasher on a hot cycle will be sufficient. Shields should be dried thoroughly before use and stored in a clean, sealed container or bag.A faster flowSwallowing encourages sucking, which will help keep milk flowing. A baby who has become used to a continuous fast flow from a bottle may need help to persist with breastfeeding. Hand expressing for a few minutes can encourage a good flow of milk before your baby latches on. You can even hand express milk into your baby’s mouth to encourage him to latch on or keep him nursing when your milk flows more slowly.Try breast compressionSupport your breast with one hand—thumb on one side, fingers on the other.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, his jaw moving all the way to his ear. When he stops swallowing, compress your breast firmly. Hold it squeezed until he stops nursing actively and then release your hand.Rotate your hand around your breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast as needed. Go gently—this should not hurt.Use a shield with a nursing supplementerIf your baby needs extra milk, a nursing supplementer can be used to deliver this through a tube as  your baby breastfeeds. This avoids the need to bottle feed. The end of the supplementer tube can be placed either inside or outside the shield. Consult an LLL Leader if you think a nursing supplementer may be helpful.Giving up the shieldsNipple shields are intended to be a temporary solution until your baby learns to breastfeed without them. When using a shield, help your baby to latch on by himself with a wide open mouth. This will help him to learn to breastfeed without a shield. Offer your baby some time in skin-to-skin contact every day without a nipple shield so he has the opportunity to latch on if he is able. It can take time to wean from shields but do keep gently trying. Try at times when you and your baby are most comfortable and relaxed and there are fewest distractions. You can try different methods to see what suits your baby.Start with skin-to-skin next to breast without the nipple shield before nursing with the shield.Start a feed with a shield, removing it part way through nursing from one breast or when switching breasts.Gradually offer the breast without the shield.DO NOT CUT a silicone shield as this could leave sharp edges that would hurt you and your baby.Source: United States Breastfeeding CommitteeSeek supportWhilst you may be relieved that a nipple shield is enabling your baby to breastfeed, it can be frustrating if he will not feed without it. However, given time and patience, it is usually possible for a baby to learn to breastfeed without the shield. An LLL Leader can be a useful source of support if you need to choose, use and wean from nipple shields.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of La Leche League GB.Further ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.
