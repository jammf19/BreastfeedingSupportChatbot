Nipple Pain,https://laleche.org.uk/nipple-pain/,"Breastfeeding is intended to be comfortable and enjoyable—so experiencing painful or sore nipples is a clear sign that something isn’t quite right. The information should help you identify the most likely cause of your discomfort and take steps to resolve it.Whilst there are a number of causes of nipple pain, by far the most common is poor attachment at the breast. Almost always thefirst step is to try to improve your baby’s latch-on. Experiment with different ways of holding your baby and also try letting your baby take the lead: sitting in a semi-reclined position and placing your baby on your front triggers his instinctive feeding reflexes (laid-back breastfeeding).If improving attachment brings no relief then you may need to consider other causes.An LLL Leader can tell you more about specific causes and treatments, and further information can be found in our other pages linked below.You can getskilled help from an LLL Leaderonline, by calling your local Leader or our national helpline, or through one of our breastfeeding support groups. Getting support and encouragement from other breastfeeding mothers in yourlocal LLL Groupmay be a real help. The sooner you seek help, the easier it usually is to resolve the problem.Pain on latch-on that improves as milk starts flowing, caused by:Poor latch-on– Try adjusting how you hold your baby at the breast.  SeeComfortable Breastfeedingand seek support from anLLL Leader.Holding your breast between your index and middle fingers while latching on, too close to the nipple– Try supporting your breast between your thumb and fingers, keeping your fingers well back from the areola. Sometimes shaping your breast slightly to match the oval of your baby’s mouth can help. Or try laid-back breastfeeding, which reduces the need to hold your baby, leaving you with both hands free to shape your breast and help him latch.Slow let-down of milk– At the start of a feed use gentle massage, relaxation, hand expression and breast compression to get milk flowing before or as your baby latches on.Pain throughout feed, stops when baby comes off, caused by:Baby not attaching deeply enough so nipple rubs on baby’s tongue or roof of baby’s mouth– Adjust how you hold your baby at the breast and seek further help fromComfortable Breastfeedingand/or from anLLL Leader.Baby is using tongue incorrectly having become used to bottle teat or dummy –Avoid using teats or dummies. SeeNipple Confusion?andDummies and BreastfeedingBaby is using his tongue incorrectly possibly due to a tongue-tie (ankyloglossia)– Seek skilled breastfeeding help to assess your baby for tongue-tie. Ask for a referral for assessment and treatment if necessary.Pain as baby comes off, caused by:Suction not broken when taking baby off– put a clean finger between your baby’s gums to break the suction if you need to remove him from the breast.OK at first, painful as feed progresses.Attachment has slipped during feed perhaps because either your breast or your baby has dropped into a lower position– Sit or lie comfortably with your body and arms supported. Keep your baby’s whole body against yours. If you recline, some or all of his weight can be supported by your body so your arms aren’t holding his entire weight throughout the feed. Let your breast rest at its natural level and bring your baby to breast, not breast to baby.  Experiment with different breastfeeding positions and seek further help from an LLL Leader.Stabbing pains in the breast throughout feed and afterwards.Vasospasm caused by baby not attaching deeply enough leading to constriction of blood vessels. Or referred pain due to poor positioning and attachment –Adjust how you hold your baby at the breast and seek further help fromComfortable Breastfeedingand from anLLL Leader. If you continue to have vasospasms even after latch-on is improved, see Raynaud’s phenomenon below.Raynaud’s phenomenon. This is where blood vessels narrow, associated with cold– Eliminate other causes first, especially if breastfeeding has always been painful or your nipples are flattened or wedge-shaped after feeds. Seek medical assessment. Keep warm and avoid nicotine and caffeine, which can be triggers.ThrushWhen baby is around 3 months or older.Shallow latch because baby has grown and positioning has not been adjusted– Adjust how you hold your baby so he can latch more deeply onto the breast. Seek further help if needed.Teething– Offer your baby something cold to chew on before breastfeeds.Baby bites to get your full attention or clamps down as he releases the breast at the end of a feed– Give your baby your full attention while nursing and have a finger ready to break suction at end of feed if needed.Skin of nipple reacting to food particles present in baby’s mouth– Rinse baby’s mouth with water before nursing; avoid offering that particular food for a while.Hormonal changes associated withpregnancyor your period can increase nipple sensitivity– Hand express to get milk flowing and vary nursing positions. A toddler may be willing to nurse for shorter times until the discomfort decreases.Nipple shaped normally but pain experienced, commonly at the tip of the nipple.Baby not attaching deeply enough– Adjust how you hold your baby at the breast. Seek further help fromComfortable Breastfeedingand/or from anLLL Leader.Breastpump suction too high or pump flange poor fit– Reduce suction or vacuum to a comfortable level.  Moisten the flange of the breastpump. Centre your nipple in the flange and/or try a different sized flange. Use breast massage andhand expressionto encourage milk to flow. Lubricate your nipples and areolae with purified lanolin suitable for breastfeeding mothers.Nipple not so prominent—baby having difficulty latching on.Engorgement– Breastfeed frequently—watch for early breastfeeding cues. Take steps to relieveengorgementand soften the breast. Try reverse pressure softening—gently pushing swelling backwards away from the areola using fingertips. Gentle massage orhand expressioncan also help.Flat/inverted nipple– see page onInverted NipplesNipple looks white and misshapen or wedge shaped when baby comes off; pain during and after feeds.Vasospasm caused by baby not attaching deeply enough causing constriction of blood vessels– Adjust how you hold your baby at the breast and seek further help fromComfortable Breastfeedingand/or from anLLL Leader. If you continue to have vasospasms even after latch on is improved, see Raynaud’s phenomenon (section below).Baby compressing nipple to cope with fast flow of milk– Baby may need to be attached more deeply at the breast.

Engorged Breasts – avoiding and treating,https://laleche.org.uk/engorged-breasts-avoiding-and-treating/,"Engorged breasts are painful. They feel heavy, hard, warm and sensitive —as if they are ready to burst!  As well as being painful, engorgement can lead to other breastfeeding problems if not treated. Being able to recognise engorgement will help you to treat it promptly, avoiding complications.Most mothers experience some engorgement in the first weeks after birth. With changing hormone levels, your breasts swell and enlarge as milk production increases. It may seem as though they are filling up with milk, but engorgement is more than milk storage. Your body directs extra blood and fluids to your breasts to boost milk production. This causes congestion and swelling which will decrease as your body adjusts.Minimizing early engorgementTreat engorgement to…When to treat engorgementAfter the first few weeksCauses of engorgementTreating engorgmentBe sure your baby is sucking effectivelyReverse pressure softeningKeep comfortableWatch out for signs of mastitisMinimizing early engorgementNew mothers vary in how engorged their breasts become in the weeks after birth; some experience little engorgement, others describe their breasts as feeling like watermelons!Try these suggestionsBreastfeed your baby frequently from birth: at least 8–12 times in 24 hours. Keeping your baby close makes it easier to nurse every hour or two.Ifyour baby is sleepy, perhaps from a medicated birth, you may need to wake him and encourage him to nurse.Aim to be comfortable while  breastfeeding, and learn how to get your baby latched on well.If your newborn is unable to breastfeed,hand expressfrequentlyuntil your milk‘comes in’, thencombine with usinga hospital-gradeelectricbreastpumptohelp establish your milkproduction and relieveengorgement. Your milkcan be given to yourbaby until he is ableto nurse.Treat engorgement to…Make breastfeeding easierEven if you feel as though you have lots of milk, engorgement can make it harder for your baby to latch on to your breast and feed well. A poor latch-on can give you sore nipples. Your baby may also have trouble coping with the flow of milk from engorged breasts.Protect milk productionWhen milk isn’t removed from your breasts, you will produce less milk. Treating engorgement gives your baby more milk now and helps protect milk production for when your baby is older.Avoidblocked ducts or mastitisEngorgement can result in blocked ducts leading to mastitis.When to treatTake action to relieve engorgement if your breasts feel firm, hard, shiny or lumpy. When milk is removed, blood circulation improves and swelling reduces. Use the suggestions below to reduce swelling and keep your milk flowing. Many mothers have a slight temperature when their breasts are engorged. Temperatures under 38.4ºC are not usually associated with infection. Keep your baby close and continue breastfeeding.Engorgement after the first weeksTreat as outlined below while working out the cause so you can prevent it happening again.Common causes of engorgement are:A missed feed or expressing session.This can easily happen during holidays and festivities or when visitors arrive. Encourage your baby to feed more often, or express more frequently if you’re apart from your baby.Feeding a baby on a scheduleRecent research has revealed that mothers vary in how much milk their breasts can store without becoming uncomfortable. Mothers following routines often suffer from engorgement, mastitis and low milk production because their breasts are not drained often enough.Expressing milk.Some books advise expressing to keep milk production one step ahead of a baby’s needs. However, making more milk than your baby needs can increase your risk of engorgement and mastitis, especially if you go for several hours without feeding or expressing.A baby who is unable or unwilling to nurse well for any reasonExpressing milk frequently until your baby can nurse well will help you maintain milk production and avoid blocked ducts or mastitis.Weaning from the breast too quicklyIf you experience engorgement duringweaning, you may need to slow down the process. This will give your breasts time to adjust to the reduced demand for milk. If breastfeeding more often is not an option, try expressing just enough milk to relieve the fullness by hand or pump.Treating engorgementReduce swelling and keep milk flowing:Aim to breastfeed every 1½ to 2 hours during the day, and at night every 2–3 hours from the start of one feed to the start of the next. Let your baby finish on the first breast before switching to the secondAvoid using bottles or dummies. If a supplement is needed try using a spoon, flexible feeding cup or syringe.Between feeds, apply ice for 15–20 minutes at a time between feeds to reduce swelling. Use an ice pack, crushed ice in plastic bags or bags of frozen vegetables (that can be refrozen several times before being thrown away). Wrap them in a lightweight towel to protect your skin.Just before feeding, apply moist warmth to your breasts for up to two minutes to help milk flow. Try a warm wet towel, warm shower or immersing breasts in a bowl of warm water.  Then, express to comfort if your baby isn’t ready to feed.Use gentle massage from the chest wall toward thenipple area in a circular motion.Be sure your baby is sucking effectively:Position your baby with his chest and tummy in full contact with your body. With his cheek in close contact with your breast, your baby can easily tip back his head to latch on. This way he’ll take a large mouthful of breast. Listen for swallowing as he feeds.If your baby is finding it hard to latch on – when your baby bobs his head and licks the nipple, he naturally makes it easier to latch on.For more information ongetting your baby positioned and attached comfortably see here.Reverse pressure softeningworks by moving fluid away from the nipple area.Press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple. Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola.You can also press with the sides of fingers. Place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be.If this isn’t enough, gently hand express a little milk before feeding to soften the areola. If you choose to use a breastpump, set it to minimum suction.Keep comfortable:Ask your midwife or GP to recommend an over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medication suitable for breastfeeding mothers to relieve pain and swelling.A well-fitting, supportive bra may help. Avoid bras (and underwires) that are tight or put pressure on specific areas of the breast.Cold, raw cabbage leaves worn inside a bra can be soothing.  Change when they become wilted or after about 2 hours. Use only until swelling goes down as long-term use may reduce milk supply. Stop use if a skin rash or other signs of allergy appear.Watch out for symptoms of mastitis:Inflamed, hot, red or darkened localised areas of your breast, depending on your skin tone. Changes in breast appearance may be harder to spot in darker skin. You may still have engorged breasts without a noticeable red or darkened area.Temperature over 38.4ºC or flu-like symptoms.Weaning can make a breast infection worse so continue to breastfeed frequently especially on the affected side and treat as for engorgement. Rest and drink fluids. If fever persists, continue breastfeeding and check with your GP as you may need antibiotics. More information onmastitis.Engorgement should improve within a day or two. If not, contact an LLL Leader for further suggestions. You may need to improve your baby’s breastfeeding technique or find ways to reduce your milk supply. These are not difficult problems to solve, especially if treated promptly.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone & mothers of La Leche League Great BritainFurther ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Safer Sleep & the Breastfed Baby,https://laleche.org.uk/safe-sleep-the-breastfed-baby/,"“In most parts of the world… babies sleep close to their mothers, as they have through most of history.” –The Womanly Art of  BreastfeedingA baby is born expecting to stay in close contact with his mother night and day, in order to keep safe, warm and well-fed.It is perfectly normal for babies—especially breastfed babies—to wake and feed at night throughout at least the first year. Bedsharing when breastfeeding is a traditional way of caring for a baby at night—breastfeeding at night can be a whole lot easier when you take your baby into bed with you and feed lying down.Breastfeeding mothers who bedshare get more sleep than bottlefeeding mothers1and breastfeed for longer.2Alternatively, co-sleeping may give your baby the closeness he craves and make breastfeeding easier without sharing the same sleep surface as you.It is possible to bedshare with twins, but co-sleeping rather than bedsharing is recommended if they were premature or low birth-weight.Infant sleep–what are the risks?The Safe Sleep SevenMeeting Everyone’s NeedsSleep SafelyEasy NightsInfant sleep–what are the risks?AccidentsBabies sleep in a variety of places at different times. Wherever a baby sleeps an accidental injury is possible. A baby could become wedged between furniture or against a parent’s body, fall off the sleep surface or risk suffocation or strangulation by pillows, cords or blankets.Anything that reduces your alertness or ability to respond to your baby, such as alcohol, drugs or certain medications, can pose a risk and may impair your judgement.Breastfed babies orient themselves near their mother’s breast in bed. Research3shows that mothers who bedshare with their breastfed babies adopt a naturally protective position, making smothering unlikely. This has been referred to as the ‘cuddle curl’ position.SIDSSudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or cot death, is a sudden unexpected infant death (usually occurring during sleep) that can’t be explained by a medical condition, infection, intentional harm, or accidental causes.What makes a baby vulnerableSIDS can happen in any sleep situation, but research has shown that SIDS only happens to baby who are vulnerable. We don’t know exactly which factors cause vulnerability, but they include4:baby being less than four months oldprenatal exposure to harmful chemicals including smoke and alcoholpreterm or low brith weight baby (under 2.5kg).SIDs risk factorsThe following factors increase the risk of SIDS for a vulnerable baby, wherever they sleep5.Exposure to smokecan affect a baby’s ability to rouse from sleep. The risk is related to how much exposure a baby has. It is always a good idea to reduce your baby’s exposure to smoke wherever they sleep, butif you are a smoker you should not share a sleep surface with your baby. Smoking is the biggest SIDS risk.Placing a baby on his frontto sleep may affect his ability to arouse and to breathe. ‘Back to Sleep’ campaigns have reduced SIDS in many Western countries. Bedsharing breastfeeding mothers often nurse in a side-lying position—when a baby comes off the breast they naturally rolls onto their back. A baby who can roll back and forth can choose his own sleep position.Being unattended.During all sleep (daytime and nightime), a baby’s risk of SIDS is lower if they are in the same room as you.Formula-feeding(including combi-feeding) imposes a statistically significant higher risk of SIDS.The Safe Sleep Seven6Breastfeeding mothers who meet the criteria below are statistically low risk and can bedshare with confidence.You need to be:A non-smokerSober (no drugs, alcohol, or medications that could make you drowsy)BreastfeedingYour baby needs to be:Healthy and full term (with a birth weight above 2.5kg)Sleeping on their back when they are not breastfeedingUnswaddled and lightly dressedYou both need to be:On a safe surface.Neversleep with your baby on a sofa or armchair.Make an informed decisionUse the information above along with our checklist below to evaluate your baby’s different sleeping places and your own family circumstances, to reduce the risk of an accident or SIDS wherever you and your baby sleep.Meeting Everyone’s NeedsIf you are struggling to reconcile your own sleep needs with those of your baby, then talking with an LLL Leader may be helpful. At anLLL meetingyou can find out how other families meet the sleep needs of their sleep needs in different ways and at different stages.Find local supporthere.  Call our helpline:0345 120 2918Photo courtesy: Rosie RoweCo-sleeping or bedsharing?7Bedsharing:adults and infants sharing the same surface for sleep.Co-sleeping:parents and infants sleeping in close proximity, but not necessarily on the same surface eg in a bedside cot or a sidecar cot attached to the bed.Some studies combine sofa sleeping with bedsharing, making it more difficult to separate the risk factors for each scenario. SeeFurther Readingfor more details, or for more information on these definitions, seehere.Sleep safelySleep tipsDo✔ Place your baby to sleep on their back.✔ Keep your sleeping baby close day and night, not in a room alone.✔ Avoid exposing your baby to cigarette smoke at any time as this increases the risk of SIDS.✔ Place your baby with his feet to the foot of any cot, crib or pram.✔ Sleep facing your baby in bed (your thigh should prevent him slipping under the covers).✔ Check your baby’s sleeping place for hazards:Choose a firm, flat, clean, well-fitting mattress and cover with a close-fitting sheet.Check for gaps that they might get trapped in..Ensure they can’t fall out.Choose clothes without strings or ties that could cause strangulation.✔ Check your baby does not get too hot or too cold whilst sleeping. In hot weather, open a window or use a fan.✔ Keep pets out of your baby’s bed.NEVER leave your sleeping baby:✘ Near a fire or radiator, or in full sun.✘ Wearing warm outdoor clothing when indoors.NEVER sleep with your baby:✘ On a sofa or armchair.✘ If he is swaddled.Bedsharing tipsWhen bedsharing do✔ Sleep facing your baby in bed (your thigh should prevent them slipping under the covers).✔ Keep pillows and your covers away from your baby.✔ Ensure anyone in the bed knows your baby is there.✔ Keep an adult between any older children and your baby in bed.Don’t bedshare✘ If any person in the bed is a smoker (even if they never smoke in bed).✘ On a soft mattress. It isn’t known whether memory foam mattresses are a problem.✘ If any person in the bed has drunk alcohol, taken drugs (legal or illegal) that could make them extra sleepy, or is too exhausted to be aware of your baby.✘ If any person in the bed has an illness or condition that affects their awareness of your baby.Once you can safely and comfortably feed your baby while lying down, you’ve elimated much of the work of mothering for eight of the 24 hours in a day.Easy NightsYou may find that different sleeping arrangements work at different times. Being inventive and focusing on how you and your family can get the most sleeptonightcan help. Some of these ideas may work for you, but because only you know your own circumstances, always keep safety in mind.Extra space can help. Try:• Using a cot designed for co-sleeping.• Pushing your baby’s cot right up to your bed. Lower the side and raise the base for easy access at night; secure the cot to your bed.• Using a larger bed.• Putting a single bed at the side for your partner, if you have one, to sleep on—keep your baby away from the gap in the mattresses.Avoid tumbles by:• Using a mesh guard rail – but make sure there is no gap between the rail and the bed.• Taking the legs off the bed or putting the mattress on the floor.Keep comfortable by:• Wearing a cardigan to keep your arms warm.• Dressing your baby in light clothes to avoid overheating.• Putting an extra thick nappy on your baby to avoid unnecessary changes in the night.• Keeping a towel handy in case of damp nappies or leaking milk.Learn to feed lying down by:• Practising in the daytime!• Keeping a low light on.• Going to aLa Leche League meetingand learning from other mothers.• Watching our video on breastfeeding while lying on your side:These safety tips apply to healthy full-term breastfed infants. Preterm and low birth weight babies are more vulnerable. If your baby seems unwell, seek medical advice promptly. Remember that safety tips can help reduce the risk of SIDS and accidents wherever your baby sleeps, but cannot eliminate the risk altogether.Written by Sue Cardus, Karen Butler, Sue Upstone, Bronwyn Davies & mothers of La Leche League GB.Further ReadingSweet Sleep: Nighttime & Naptime Strategies for the Breastfeeding FamilyWiessinger, West, Smith, Pitman, LLLI.

Breastfeeding at a Swimming Pool,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-at-a-swimming-pool/,"Women are sometimes told that breastfeeding at, or in, a swimming pool is prohibited. The reasons for this are often cited as hygiene or contamination fears.Fears that breastmilk will ‘pollute’ the poolFears that a baby will vomit in the poolIt is unhygienic for the babyNo eating rule should apply to allWhy can’t the mother get out of the pool?The Indecency ArgumentEquality Act 2010Report into Breastfeeding at Municipal PoolsFears that breastmilk will ‘pollute’ the poolBreastmilk does not pose any health hazard to other swimmers.  If it did then pools would need to ban all lactating women from using them!  Even if any breastmilk gets into the water it is actually antibacterial, and antimicrobial, and won’t cause any problems.Urine, hair, sweat, mucus, saliva, even faecal matter are found in pools, not to mention the various products people have put onto their skins. Swimming pool water is chlorinated for the purpose of killing bacteria and breastmilk is probably one of the things swimmers need to least worry about.Fears that a baby will vomit in the poolA baby who has just been breastfed is no more likely to vomit or bring up milk than a baby who had a formula feed.  If a mother knows her baby is prone to copious posseting then she will be aware of the possible problems.  It seems unlikely thatanyonewould want their child to vomit in a pool!It is unhygienic for the babyIt is possible a baby will ingest a small amount of pool water, but probably a lot less than they will when they are actually swimming.  A baby’s mouth forms a seal around the breast – if a tiny amount of water is swallowed it will be no more harmful than that swallowed at other times.No eating rule should apply to allThis rule was intended to apply to things such as solid food, tea, coffee, fizzy drinks and such like.  Breastmilk is not really comparable to these, and will not contaminate the pool in the way other foodstuffs would.  Breastmilk is not just a food for a baby but also a way of comforting them.  Babies can’t plan when they need to nurse so it is impossible to expect them to eat beforehand or wait until afterwards in the same way that adults and older children can.Why can’t the mother get out of the pool?A mother will often be at the pool with an older child.  It is impractical to take the child out and certainly not acceptable to leave another child in the pool on their own.  A few minutes at the breast may well be enough to comfort the baby and for everyone to carry on without disruption.The Indecency ArgumentA mother nursing her child is not necessarily showing anymore flesh, and most likely a lot less, than many other people in the pool and this includes men as well as women!Equality Act 2010It is entirely legal to breastfeed in public places anywhere in the UK. According to the Equality Act of 2010, treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding a child of any age is considered sex discrimination. This applies to any business or premise providing services to the public, including public institutions, associations and higher education bodies. Service providers dealing directly with the public must not discriminate, harass or victimise a woman because she is breastfeeding. Discrimination includes refusing to provide a service, providing a lower standard of service or providing a service on different terms.It is possible that individual business employees, owners or managers may not be aware of these regulations and may tell a woman that she cannot breastfeed on the business premises. If this happens, the mother can challenge their request. If still asked to stop breastfeeding or leave the premises, a woman can contact the Government Equalities Office. A solicitor can advise on whether a claim can be brought for discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act. In previous cases where women have been asked to stop breastfeeding in the pool, the authorities concerned have eventually reversed their decision and stated that women are entitled to breastfeed if they wish to.Report into Breastfeeding at Municipal PoolsIn August 2002 a report was prepared on behalf of the Breastfeeding Action Committee of Edmonton (Canada).  This looked at complaints made about women who breastfed at public pools and addressed all the issues raised.  You can read ithere.Written by Anna Burbidge.

These include:when a baby can’t breastfeedto make more milka return to paid workseparationchoiceWhen a baby can’t breastfeedBabies and parents have many instincts for breastfeeding, but it is still a learned skill that can take time and practice. When babies won’t breastfeed, it is usually because they can’t. This could be for many reasons, for example:they are pretermthey are unwellthey have a tongue tiethey are sleepy as a result of birth medicationsthey had a difficult birthit is taking time to learn how to breastfeedExpressing milk when your baby cannot nurse – or nurse effectively – protects your milk supply and provides milk to feed them. Breastmilk is especially important for babies who are unwell and/orpretermas it helps protect against illness and infections, and is ideal for a baby’s sensitive and immature digestive system.Expressing milk is often a short-term solution. However, some mothers may find themselves exclusively expressing breast milk (‘exclusively pumping‘) long-term when their baby is ill or has medical difficulties.Making more milkOnce your baby is born,milk productionworks on a supply and demand basis: the more milk you remove, the more milk you are likely to make. The first two weeks are very important. If not enough milk is removed early on, it may affect your long-term supply, and your baby may not gain weight as expected.Some parents have underlying conditions that are risk factors for low milk supply. However, it is usually possible tomake more milk. The main way to do this is by removing milk frequently, and for some parents this will include expressing.A return to paid workThere are many ways to combineworking and breastfeeding. It is not always necessary to express milk when returning to work. It may depend on:the age of your babythe length of time you are apartyour willingness – and ability – to express; pumping is not effective for everyone, although there are ways to improve this.your baby’s willingness to take your milk when you aren’t thereMany mothers express initially for reassurance and comfort, and to avoidblocked ducts and mastitis. However, you may find that your body quickly adjusts to a new breastfeeding pattern and you no longer need or want to express.SeparationYou and your baby may need to be apart. This may be for illness or health reasons, an appointment or event, or a night away.Your baby has an intense need for your presence as well as your milk, and separation can be hard for both of you. It may be possible to take your baby with you – young babies are very portable and often enjoy being out and about.ChoiceSome mothers choose to express milk some or all of the time. You might want – or feel pressured – to let a partner or other family member feed your baby. Some parents choose to exclusively pump because they don’t enjoy breastfeeding, but want their baby to have the benefits of their milk.There are many wayspartners and familycan bond and be involved with a baby. Expressing milk takes time and energy.Any breastmilk is good; however there are differences between a baby feeding at the breast anddrinking breastmilk by a different method, for example from a cup or bottle.Expressing MilkWhat kind of pump do I need?Pumps are available to hire and to buy. The pump you use depends on your reason(s) for expressing and your personal preference. We all respond differently to pumps and have different needs.Single electric pumpsandmanualpumps are best suited tooccasional expressing, for example, short term separation or a return to work. They can also be used toexpress ‘to comfort’any time your breast feels very full and your baby doesn’t want to feed.Double electric pumpsexpress milk from both breasts at once, which often saves time. It is also said that they tend to stimulate more milk production. They are available aspersonal usepumps and‘hospital grade’pumps.Hospital grade pumpsare very powerful and are intended to be used by more than one person multiple times a day. They are usually hired. Hospital grade pumps are recommended when you areexclusivelyexpressing, expressingvery frequently, or trying to increase your supply. Parents might start with a hospital grade and then switch to a personal use pump once their supply is established and if they need to keep expressing.Silicone pumpstend to be best suited tooccasionaluse. Some mothers have found them helpful to relieve blocked ducts. (Note: When attached to the breast, a silicone pump is not just a device for collecting dripping milk – it creates a vacuum stimulating a ‘letdown’. If this is not your planned use, it can createsupply issues.)Hands-free pumpscome as single or double electric pumps. They can be handy for mums who want to pump on the go, or pump and multitask. Hands-free pumps have small motors and are possibly best suited to occasional pumping. You can buy or make a hands-free bra for a pump to fit in to.Image Copyright ©Types of Pump (image above)A. Manual breast pumpB. Single electric pumpC. Double electric pumpIt is also possible to express without any equipment.Hand expressingis a great skill to learn for all ages and stages! It can take a little practice, but it can quickly become second nature:It is free and can be done any time, anywhere!It is theperfect choice for the early dayswhen you are producing colostrum (you cancollect–or ‘harvest’–colostrumbefore your baby is born).You can practiseantenatallyand become familiar with your breasts before your baby arrives.Getting ‘hands-on’ during a pumping session can increase milk output. SeeExpressing Tips.What else do I need to know about pumps?Pump fitPumps are often sold in a standard size, however pumppartscome in different sizes. The funnel-shaped piece that touches your breast is usually called aflange. The tubed-shaped bit that the nipple goes into is sometimes called thenipple tunnel.If pumping is comfortable with good milk flow, you probably have a good fit. However, if pumping ispainfulor causing swelling and/or rubbing, you may need abigger or smaller flange. Sometimes a different flange size is needed for each breast. A poor fit can also reduce milk flow.1The nipple should have enough room to slide in and out during pumping, without rubbing. The areola (darker area around the nipples) may move slightly with it, but it shouldn’t be drawn into the nipple tunnel. After pumping, the nipple will almost certainly be bigger, but shouldn’t seem darker or swollen.2Image Copyright ©Pump Flange Sizes (image above)A. Milk expressionB. Flange is too bigC. Flange fitsD. Flange is too smallSuction strength and cycle speedElectric pumps often come with a range of settings. There will be settings forsuction strengthand settings forcycle speed.A pump is trying to mimic a breastfeeding baby. When a baby nurses, they do a fast, light suck to trigger a letdown. Once the milk lets down, the sucking slows and they swallow more.You mightbegin by using a low suction, high speed settingand once your milk starts flowing,switching to a higher suction, lower speed setting.Exactly how high or low depends on how it feels and if it is removing milk well.Expressing should be comfortable,and a pump provides most milk when it is set at the upper end of fully comfortable.3Painful pumping may impact milk flow, damage your nipples, and is unlikely to make you feel like doing it!How often and when should I express?If your baby can’t breastfeed yet, aim to express8–10 times in a 24-hour period, including at least once at night. These do not need to be at regular time intervals, but avoid stretches longer than 5 or 6 hours. Once your supply is well established, you may find that you can get by with fewer sessions.4If you are trying tomake more milk, express after or between feeds. How often depends on how much more milk your baby needs and how feeding at the breast is going.If you arereturning to paid work,how often you express will depend on a number of things. Some parents look at how often they feed on average in a 24-hour period and work out how many feeds they will typically have when they are with their child, so express the same number of times when separated to maintain this daily average.If you are stockpiling milk for short-termseparationor in the run up to a return to work, express once or twice a day after or between feeds. If your baby typically feeds from one breast, you could express from the other side while they feed. The amounts may seem small, but they quickly build up!Some mothers try ‘power pumping’ as a short-term strategy toincrease their milk supply, or when they are struggling to fit pumping into their daytime routine. This approach involves expressing very frequently for short periods, stopping and starting as many times as possible – it is said to mimic cluster feeding.How long should I express for?Just like breastfeeding, expressing milk is not a ‘one-size-fits-all’. Observe your milk flow, notice how your breasts feel and find what works for you.If you are using a single pump, this usually takes about 20–30 minutes for both breasts. You might try switching sides when the milk flow slows, usually every 5–7 minutes.5Double pumps save time. A double-pumping session that replaces what would have been nursing will probably last no more than 15 minutes. However, it is more important to pay attention to your breasts than the clock.6How much milk will I express?How much we can express at any one time depends on lots of different things. If you’ve never used a pump before, it might be helpful to think of the first pumping sessions as practice.7Expect small amounts in the early days. This will be drops for some and as much as a teaspoon for others. Many parents think of it as ‘putting in their order’ for more milk later.8If you are breastfeeding full-time, expect to express around 15–60ml (0.5–2 fl oz) in total from both breasts per pumping session.9If you are exclusively pumping, consider the overall volume in 24 hours. Full milk production is about 750–900 ml (25–30 fl oz) per baby. Milk production reaches its peak at about five weeks and stays relatively stable until around six months.10Once milk production peaks, a typical feed is about 60–120ml (2–4 fl oz).11We all respond differently to pumps. How much you can express is not always a reliable or accurate sign of how much milk is there. It’s important to remember that a baby who is nursing effectively will get more milk than a pump.Expressing tipsBeforeexpressing:Wash your hands and get comfortablePut something warm on your breasts, such as a warm flannelGentlymassage your breastsUse any objects or techniques that help you to feel calm and relaxed. This might be a photo of your baby, an item of their clothing, a favourite warm drink or snack, music or visualisations.Whileexpressing:Try ‘hands-on pumping’. This is said to produce better results than relying on a pump alone12Usebreast compressionto increase milk flowTake a break midway and gently massage the breasts to help increase the amount of milk.13Hand express from both breasts after you have finished pumping.Try nursing your baby on one side and expressing on the other, or expressing from both sides at the same time, to encourage more letdownsAfterexpressing:Hand-express for a minute or two to help increase output and supply.Cleaning pump partsThere is not complete agreement about cleaning pumping equipment. Some public/advisory bodies (including NHS England) recommend sterilising equipment after every feed.Others recommend washing pump parts thoroughly after every feed and sterilising once a day.Some advisory bodies and breastfeeding organisations state that pump parts do not need to be sterilised, and that washing in hot soapy water is enough if your baby is healthy and full term.Day-to-day milk handlingThere is very little research on the day-to-day problems of milk handling, so guidelines often err on the side of caution.Fresh human milk kills almost all bacteria, viruses and fungi that it comes in contact with.14Mothers who are exclusively expressing, or expressing frequently, sometimes put the whole pumping kit (flanges attached) in a clean container in the fridge until the next expressing session and clean everything at the end of the day.Breastmilk can be safely stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours (see below). Some parents apply the same timeframe to their pump and pump parts, and express multiple times within a 4 hour period before cleaning everything.One quick method of sterilising is to use a sterilising fluid that you change every 24 hours. Submerge pump parts in the solution after washing them each time.15Washing and dryingEnsure hands and pump area are clean.You may like to use a separate basin and separate utensils for cleaning pump parts and equipment rather than the sink.Clean with hot soapy water and rinse separately with clean water.Some pump equipment is also dishwasher-safe.Air dry or dry with paper towels.Clean pump dials and switches with a disinfectant spray or wipe.Store dry pump equipment in a clean container.If you are expressing milk for asick or premature baby, good hygiene is vital andsterilising is essential.Storing MilkHow long can I store milk for?There isn’t complete agreement about milk storage.Wherever you are storing milk, the fresher it is, the better.Good hygiene is important — clean hands, clean pump parts, clean storage.For healthy, full term babies16:Room temperatureIdeally, use within4 hours.Depending on room temperature and how clean storage conditions are, up to6–8 hoursmay be safe.Frozen milk that has thawed and kept at room temperature should be used within4 hours.FridgeIdeally, use within4 days.When conditions are very clean,5–8 daysmay be acceptable.Store milk in the back of the fridge rather than in the door.Frozen milk that has thawed in the fridge should be used within24 hours.FreezerIdeally, use within6 months.Can be stored for up to12 months.Store at the back of the freezer, away from the door where temperatures may fluctuate.Insulated bagUse within24 hours.Milkleft overafter a feed should be used within1–2 hoursas it mixes with a baby’s saliva, although it may be safe to put it in a fridge for up to 4 hours.17Forpremature or sick babies, consult with hospital staff and follow hospital guidelines.Combining expressed milkWhen combining milk expressed at different times, mix cold with cold:Chill newly expressed milk before adding it to an existing container.You can add refrigerated milk to frozen as long as there is less refrigerated milk than frozen.Use within the time limit of the oldest expressed milk.What can I store milk in?You can store milk in any clean container, such as a hard (BPA-free) plastic or glass container with a tight-fitting lid, or a disposable milk storage bag.Milk expands in the freezer, so leave space in the bag or bottle if you plan to freeze it.Put the date on the container.How much milk should I store?Store milk in small quantities to avoid waste. Small amounts also defrost more quickly.For babies older than one month, a feed is approximately 60–120ml. You could also store some smaller amounts in case you need to offer more.How do I prepare stored milk?You don’t have to warm milk – some babies like it cold!If you do warm milk, run the container under a warm tap or place it in a pan of warm water.Never use a microwave or heat milk directly.Swirl milk to combine rather than shaking it.If defrosting milk, thaw it overnight in a fridge or hold it under warm running water.Thawed milk should not be kept at room temperature. It should either be fed immediately or put in the fridge.Smelly milkSometimes milk smells or tastes soapy after a short time in the fridge or freezer. This is because of an enzyme (lipase) that breaks down fats in milk. The milk is completely safe and most babies will drink it. However, if they refuse to, heat freshly-expressed milk to scalding (bubbling around the edges, but not boiling) and then quickly cool and freeze it. Scalding reduces some of the immune factors, but may be the only option for some families. You can also experiment with the length of storage time needed for the milk to acquire the smell.Feeding your baby your milkSeeFurther Readingand resources below for information on ways to feed your baby your expressed milk.Writtenby Charlotte Allam, March 2023.

Supporting a Breastfeeding Mother,https://laleche.org.uk/supporting-a-breastfeeding-mother/,"New parents need time to adjust to their new roles. Life may change dramatically, especially for a ﬁrst time mother—many women say they didn’t feel prepared for the emotional upheaval they experienced on becoming a mother. Even experienced mothers can have difﬁculties juggling the needs of the new baby with those of older children.At this time a pair of practical helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding. In the early days, a baby will probably want to breastfeed a lot of the time they are awake. At this stage, a mother may only be managing to eat, sleep and nurse the baby.This is normal. At ﬁrst their mother and nursing will be at the centre of a baby’s world. The security of a baby’s bond with their mother is the basis for all other relationships. A breastfeeding mother generally feels an intense connection with her baby, both emotionally and physically, due to breastfeeding hormones and the practical need to stay close to nurse her baby.This way, babies get what they need to thrive. A baby’s wants are a baby’s needs—they can’t wait like an adult can. By meeting your baby’s needs a mother gives them a secure attachment so they can develop into a conﬁdent child.Why breastfeed?When can a baby start eating solid food?When will a baby sleep through the night?When does breastfeeding stop?Support for mothers is importantWays to support a breastfeeding motherWhat breastfeeding mothers say when asked what would helpWhat about partners?What about dads?Two women having a babyWhat about other family members?What about visitors?Other ways to helpWhen a mum has no supportWhy breastfeed?Breastmilk has everything a growing baby needs in exactly the right amounts and is easy to digest. Research shows that a baby who is not breastfed is more likely to suffer from health problems, both as a child and throughout adulthood. Infant formula increases a child’s risk of (amongst many other health problems): SIDS, Cancer, Obesity, Diabetes, and Allergies.SeeAmazing milkfor more information.What about breastfeeding in public places?Babies often want to breastfeed when people around them are eating and drinking—and why not? Mothers breastfeed in many public places and tend to be so discreet you may not even have noticed.Breastfeeding is also convenient when a mother is out and about. She can spot early feeding cues and offer a feed before her baby gets frantic—well before those around her are even aware. After all, no one notices a baby nestled in mum’s arms but a crying baby guarantees an audience!When can a baby start eating solid food?Breastmilk is a complete food so a healthy baby needs only breastmilk until about the middle of the ﬁrst year. There’s no beneﬁt to be found in introducing solid foods before this time. If a baby seems hungry, more breastmilk usually does the trick—mothers could breastfeed more often, offering both sides. Many babies who start on solid foods from around six months quickly learn to feed themselves and enjoy sitting up with the family at mealtimes.SeeStarting Solid Food.When will a baby sleep through the night?A baby will need to breastfeed during the night for a number of months to ensure they take in enough milk and to maintain their mother’s milk production. Just as there’s no ﬁxed age for when a baby is ready to walk or talk, there’s no real way of knowing when they will be ready to sleep through the night.  Consider whether you sleep through the night now? Many adults wake, turn over and go back to sleep as a matter of course.  As a baby grows their sleep cycles will naturally get longer. In the meantime, they will wake and be likely to need the comfort of mother, her co-parent or other family member’s presence to help them relax and fall back to sleep.What about bottles and dummies?Bottlesordummiescan confuse a baby’s sucking technique, so if a supplement is needed, a spoon, ﬂexible feeding cup or syringe can be used.  Giving formula affects a mother’s milk production since a baby will take less breastmilk. Some mothersexpressmilk for their partner, or another support person, to give but expressing takes more effort than simply breastfeeding.  If a mother is ﬁnding night feeding exhausting you could encourage her to rest during the day, to try feeding lying down and to keep baby close at night so she doesn’t have to get up. See our page onSafer Sleepfor more information.When does breastfeeding stop?When does a baby’s need to use nappies or a highchair stop? It’s all very individual. It doesn’t usually help to push children on to the next stage until they are ready.  Breastmilk is just as nutritious as it was when they were tiny and it still protects them from infection.  There is no evidence that continuing to breastfeed makes a toddler clingy—in fact the opposite may be the case. A toddler may seem big but emotionally they are still a baby. It’s easier on mother and baby to let breastfeeding end gradually.Breastfeeding bonusesNothing compares with breastmilk for growing healthy, clever babies.No getting up to prepare bottles during the night.Your baby’s nappies won’t smell bad.No feeding equipment and expensive formula to buy for your baby.Less to take with you when you go out with your baby.Support for mothers is importantOne very real problem is that many mothers don’t receive enough support in the early days and months, and simply try to do too much. Most mothers who stop breastfeeding before they want to cite lack of support as the reason. They need time to recover and adjust, especially after a difﬁcult birth. Caring for a newborn really is a full time job, and that’s before you add in essential jobs around the house and caring for any older children. All mothers need practical help andsupport.The biggest challenges for all mothers are:Getting enough sleep.Keeping up with basic housework.Lack of emotional support.IsolationThe help you give can make a lot of difference to a new mother, especially when her baby seems to be nursing all the time and is waking at night. Be sensitive to her needs. What you can offer and do will partly depend on whether you are a friend or family member, and the closeness of your relationship. Some mothers will want more practical help, others more emotional help—and a mother may have strong views on what help she will accept and from whom.Ways to support a breastfeeding motherYou may be her partner, the baby’s dad or mum, a family member or friend. All mothers need support, and whatever your relationship to her there are things you can do to help.With baby:Walks in the fresh air. Consider wearing baby in a sling or other carrier.Go out and about; babies are social people.Read and sing to baby—they’ll love hearing your voice.Take a bath together, or bathe them in the baby bath. Many babies love bathtime!Sleep with them. Visit our page onSafer Sleep and the Breastfed Baby.Hold them on your chest while they nap to help your baby feel safe and relaxed.Nappy changes are perfect for games and chat.Talk to your baby about things around the house.Take your baby to their mother whenever they need her.Use the Magic Baby Hold: with your baby’s back against your front, bring your left arm over their left shoulder (one arm on either side of yours), and hold their right thigh.Try othercomfort techniques.Jiggle and sway. Babies tend to like side- to- side motion.For the breastfeeding mother:Make sure she has food and drinks.Cut her food up for her if she’s holding the baby!Hold the baby so she can take a shower.Help her get goodhelpif she needs it.Guard against too many visitors. Let others know when you need to be alone. Protect mum and baby from over-enthusiastic visitors and callers, and try to ensure you all have some peaceful uninterrupted time together. Turn off the phone and put a ‘do not disturb’ sign on the front door.Look after older children. Provide fun activities and opportunity for exercise. Try to meet their needs for attention, sleep and healthy food.Fight off any pressure to separate mum and baby. Help mum and baby spend lots of time snuggling together in the hours and days after birth.What breastfeeding mothers say when asked what would help“The best presents for a new mum are home cooked meals frozen in take away tubs- ready meals but real food!”“Order a box set & takeaway!”“I need friends supporting me, sharing laughter and tears, coffee and cake”“Make sure I have water, muslin, remote control, phone, book & cake”“Bring me snacks that are tasty, healthy and one-handed!”“When it’s really hot and my baby is going through a growth spurt, bring me long, cool glasses of water!”“The best way anyone can help is by taking care of the pile of washing up!”“Call me during the day to say ‘Hi!’ and ask how I’m doing”“Please don’t try and give my baby formula, the moment you do you undermine my confidence in my body’s ability to sustain my baby”“Give me support & encouragement  and tell people who criticise or question me that I’m doing ok”“Don’t tell me it is ‘normal’ and that I should persevere if I am in pain”“Pass me the phone with abreastfeeding counselloron the other end if I’m in pain”“Never say ‘well you are breastfeeding’ when I say I’m tired”“Tell me it’s ok to take one feed at a time”“Give me a thumbs up!”“Tell me my baby is beautiful”“Take my older children to the park”Below is lots of information about supporting a breastfeeding mother, divided into different sections. You may find useful information in all of the sections regardless of your own role and relationship to mum and baby.What about partners?Your baby doesn’t need you to feed them.* So what can you do? Anything else! You are The Safe Person Who Is Not Mum.Whether or not you are your baby’s biological parent, and whatever your family looks like, your partner needs your support.  In the early days, your baby will probably want to breastfeed a lot of the time they are awake. At this stage, your partner may only be managing to eat, sleep and nurse the baby. This is normal.At first their mother and nursing will be the centre of your baby’s world. Don’t worry if you find you don’t get to hold your baby for long before their mum is needed again. A baby’s bond with their mother is the basis for all other relationships. Encouraging the closeness with mum will strengthen their love for you later. Soon that tiny baby will be reaching out to the rest of the world. They will want all the fun and excitement you can give!You are different. Your shape, voice, hands, and smell are different. You hold baby differently. You teach them that different can be good, and when they are frazzled you may be just the difference that your baby needs needs.As life settles down you and your partner will probably both need time to adjust to your new roles as parents. Many women say they didn’t feel prepared for the emotional upheaval they experienced on becoming a mother. You’ll also find lots of changes in your life.Breastfeeding mothers often feel an intense connection with their baby, both emotionally and physically, due to breastfeeding hormones and the practical need to stay close to feed the baby. It can be easy to feel a bit left out of this. Try to get involved in practical ways. It will help you bond with your baby—your partner will love you for it and so will your baby.You may both find that your baby becomes central to your life—their needs being met before either of yours. This is nature’s way of ensuring babies get what they need to thrive.Your first job is to support breastfeeding, not compete with it. A “relief bottle” may seem helpful, but it’s more likely to cause breastfeeding problems and health risks for baby. Protect your partner from criticism and tell her she’s doing a good job. Protect your partner from well meaning but unhelpful advice that undermines breastfeeding—even if it comes from your own mum!Admire and praise your baby’s mother. Your love and encouragement will work wonders. Firmly resist pressures to feed baby anything other than mum’s own milk before he is six months old. Your baby doesn’t need other foods until they can sit up and begin to feed themselves. Even then, breastmilk carries on being an important food for older babies and toddlers.*Some non-gestational mothers do breastfeed their babies. See the sectionTwo women having a babyWhat about dads?Dads feel different, they often have deep voices and a different smell. They move and hold a baby differently. At the end of a long day, dad, with all his special differences, can be just what baby and mother need. Dads are fun and have a special gift for playing with babies. They play the sort of exciting games babies enjoy. Your baby will adore your singing and funny noises (even if mum doesn’t). And you’ll probably enjoy your baby’s toys as much as he does! Dads are just as good at cuddles as mums. A great way to comfort your baby is to use a carrier—babies usually love them and it’s a handy way to settle your baby. At times when your baby is fussy or uncomfortable and nothing else works, thecolic holdis a dad’s speciality.Caring for your baby teaches them that love comes from interacting with people as well as from food.Try some of suggestions in the section aboveWays to support a breastfeeding mother.You can support your baby’s mother by making the most of yourpaternity leave. Take as long as you can manage. Take it when the mother and baby would otherwise be at home alone. Concentrate just on the needs of mum, baby and any other children. Let everything else wait.Meet your baby’s need for you. Your baby needs you to be a dad, not a substitute mother. Spend time with your baby and enjoy your unique father-baby relationship.Two women having a babyFor lesbian couples, if you’re the non-gestational parent you may feel left out – especially if  you have to explain you are the baby’s mother too. Finding support for yourself and your breastfeeding partner is important. Your partner and your baby need you now, and your baby will need you more and more as they grow. You could be entitled topaid leavealthough your employer may not be aware of this, there are resources inFurther Readingthat might help.In some couples two mothers do share breastfeeding; others find different ways to connect, you’ll find lots of ideas in the section aboveWays to support a breastfeeding mother.Deciding to share breastfeeding, and how you do that, are personal decisions. You can read about how one couple shared breastfeedinghere:You will find resources inFurther Reading,or contact your local LLL Leader who can help you talk about your options.What about other family members?Is the new baby in your family breastfed? New research has shown that breastfeeding is important for the baby’s health and development and for the mother’s health, both now and in the future. It’s even good for the environment.Research has found that breastfeeding works best when the baby is fed in response to hunger cues, not on a schedule. That’s usually quite frequently, especially in the beginning. Fortunately, you can’t feed too often.Sore nipples aren’t an expected part of breastfeeding; they are a sign that something isn’t quite right. With some expert help, the mother should soon be breastfeeding comfortably.Most medical experts, including the NHS and theWorld Health Organization, recommend that babies be breastfed exclusively— no formula or solid foods— for six months or so, and continue breastfeeding with solid foods added to their diet into these toddler years—even two years or more.Much of this may be different from what you learned when you had your own babies. But guess what hasn’t changed? New mothers still need lots of help, lots of support, and lots of loving family members around to prepare meals or throw in a load of laundry. They need people to be patient with them as they figure out both breastfeeding and motherhood. And babies still need their grandparents, aunties, uncles, cousins, siblings and other family members to love them. Your practical help and support are a golden investment in your family’s future, and in your lives together.What about visitors?Prioritise tasks: the needs of people are best dealt with before housework. Avoid trying to take over baby care or expecting to be entertained when you visit. Concentrate on ‘mothering the mother’ and helping with household jobs.Offer practical help with housework and essential tasks:grocery shopping, laundry, preparing meals or providing a meal that can simply be reheated, leaving her a sandwich lunch, washing up and cleaning the kitchen, tidying and vacuuming.Bring her the things she needs while nursing: eg drinks, snacks, pillows, books, the TV remote, her mobile.Make her a drink and offer your company for a while.Tell her how well she’s doing.Listen if she is feeling worried, tired, or overwhelmed. She might find it easier to talk to you about her worries than to close family.Help her ﬁnd another mother to talk to.Help with the baby and any older children: changing nappies; care for the baby while mum sleeps, goes to the loo, takes a short walk or a bath.Entertain and care for older children. Perhaps take them out for a walk, to the park or invite them round to play with your children. Help with the school run or taking older children to after school activities.Other ways to helpWelcome breastfeeding so the mum feels comfortable nursing in your presence, be a breastfeeding advocate. Avoid undermining her conﬁdence by asking negative questions like,“Are you sure the baby is getting enough to eat?”or,“Why aren’t they sleeping through the night yet?”.Offer a sympathetic ear rather than advice when she complains or seems tired—try to support and encourage.Find out about what is normal for nursing babies of different ages.

Twins and More,https://laleche.org.uk/twins/,"Learning you are pregnant with twins, triplets or more changes your expectations and plans. But you can still plan to breastfeed.Breastmilk is a complete and perfect food for your baby. It is especially important for multiples, who are often small at birth. Breastfeeding also helps you create a special bond with each of your babies. Many mothers have nursed their multiples; you can enjoy nurturing your babies this way, too.Planning aheadLimit visitorsMaking enough milkCo-ordinating feedsSeparationNight feedsLooking after yourselfOther sources of practical helpMixed feelingsPracticalities of getting outFinding supportPlanning aheadPhoto courtesy: Roisin KeenanIf possible, attendLa Leche League meetingsor ourAntenatal Breastfeeding classesin pregnancy to learn about breastfeeding and meet breastfeeding mothers. Do readThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, Mothering Multiples by Karen Gromada and our page onBirth and Breastfeeding.Even with good care, you might experience complications during pregnancy so it helps to be prepared. Ask your midwife for information on warning signs for premature labour. Seek medical attention quickly if any occur, or you have any of these symptoms: a severe headache or stomach ache, see spots in front of your eyes, or feel extremely irritable or tense.Limit visitorsLimit visitors in the early days while you are gaining confidence breastfeeding.  Tell friends and family you need time to recover and suggest they visit later, or drop round a meal! You may want to practice feeding two babies together before doing it in front of other people.Making enough milkThe more milk your babies take, the more your breasts will make. This is especially important in the first few weeks. Since mothers of multiples usually experience more breast development during pregnancy, mothers of mulitples can usually produce enough milk for two or even three babies.SeeIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Encourage each baby to feed at least 8–10 times in 24 hours. If one of your babies is too sleepy to rouse himself every few hours, you will need to wake them to feed to ensure they get enough milk. See our pageSleepy Baby—why and what to do.At first you may feel you are doing nothing but feeding, but things will settle down as your babies grow and your milk production adjusts. Practical help with everything else will allow you to sit or lie down and concentrate on the important job of establishing breastfeeding.Co-ordinating feedsOnce breastfeeding is established, you may find nursing two at once is easiest and saves time. But remember each baby is different and one baby may need more feeding than the other.Laid back breastfeeding positionscan leave your hands free to help each baby latch on well. Nursing pillows designed for twins are also available. Feeding two babies at the same time may help if one of your babies is less efficient at nursing, as let-down will occur more easily.SeparationYou can still breastfeed, even if you can’t be with your babies straight away. Hold, or at least touch, your babies immediately after the birth or as soon as you can. You can still touch and stroke a baby in special care and may be able to hold him against you in ‘kangaroo mother care’. If he can’t breastfeed,expressyour milk for him. This is the most important thing you can do whilst you are waiting to start breastfeeding. When you are back together, spend as much time as possible snuggling together skin-to-skin to establish breastfeeding.If you need to express your milk because one or both babies can’t nurse,hand expressionis useful in the first few days. Plan to express from both breasts at least eight times in 24 hours, about every two to three hours during the day and at least once during the night. As your milk increases, you can switch to a hospital grade automatic electric pump. For more expressing, see our articlehere.After separation, many mothers experience shock, sadness, mourning for missed bonding opportunities, worry for babies who are ill, fear and a lack of control. It can be difficult to put into works what you are feeling, but it can have a bit impact on you.Blissoffers free counselling services for parents of premature or sick babies, or you GP can refer you.Night feedsBreastfeeding at night lying down gives you more rest. It gets easier as your babies grow. In the meantime, use enough pillows to recline in bed and feed two babies at once. Keep a drink and snack handy plus books or music to pass the time. SeeSafer Sleep and the Breastfed Baby.Looking after yourselfYou’ll be busy looking after your babies but don’t forget to look after yourself too. Try to eat a balanced diet and drink enough. Get as much rest as possible, and sleep whenever your babies sleep.Looking after your babies will be a full-time job for quite a while so expect to do only the absolute minimum of other tasks.Accept offers of help with housework or olders children if it feels right. Sometimes helpers wait to be asked so having a list of specific tasks ready can make it easier. You could also share our leaflet or link toSupporting a Breastfeeding Mother.Your partner or support person will have a crucial role both practically and emotionally. Other family members and your support network may also enjoy the chance to be practically involved and make quickly develop close relationships with your babies.Take moments to appreciate this special time and be proud that you can nourish and nurture two or more little human beings at once!Other sources of practical helpMidwives, health visitors, clinics and surgeries.Homestart– a charity which offers support and friendship to families who are struggling to cope for a variety of reasons.Mixed feelingsMothers of twins or more often have mixed emotions about being a mother to multiples. It’s normal to feel ‘touched out’, overwhelmed and exhausted when caring for two or more babies at once. It can really help to talk to another mother in the same situation. Yourlocal LLL Leadercan put you in touch with other mothers who have breastfed multiples. Consider joining the ‘Breastfeeding Twins and Triplets’Facebook group. There may also be a local twins support group near you (seeFurther Informationsection).Adjusting to Motherhoodhas practical tips on dealing with feelings too.Practicalities of getting outIt’s daunting leaving the house with more than one baby. Start by going out briefly with someone else to help.Keep a changing bag packed and ready. A backpack leaves your hands free.Keep valuables and keys safe to hand in a waist pack or small bag across your chest.Slings designed for twins are available. Consider using a sling or carrier for one baby even when out with a pushchair. A double pushchair can be useful for carrying shopping too.Alternate which baby gets carried: it’s easy to overlook a quieter baby’s need for closeness if one fusses more when out and about.Think about suitable places for feeding ahead of time. Look out for your babies’ early feeding cues so you can offer a feed before they start to fuss and attract attention from others. You may prefer to feed one baby at a time while out and feed two together at home. Or you may quickly get to grips with feeding two babies together while out. It’s a great way to quieten two hungry babies and quickly meet their needs.Get to know your babiesWith time, you will come to know your babies as individuals. Take opportunities to give them a little undivided attention: feeding, nappy changes etc. A few minutes here and there all add up. Their different personalities will soon show through.Finding supportIt can take a while for breastfeeding to become easy, or for your babies to learn to breastfeed effectively. If you need to seek out breastfeeding support as soon as you encounter a problem – don’t wait. You can get skilled help from an LLL Leader and support and encouragement from yourlocal LLL group.Further ReadingAdjusting to MotherhoodAntenatal Expression of ColostrumBirth and BreastfeedingCaesarean Birth and BreastfeedingHand Expression of BreastmilkMy Baby Needs More MilkSleepy Baby – Why and What to DoSupporting A Breastfeeding MotherMothering through special careLLLI ResourcesBreastfeeding Premature BabiesWhen there are two – breastfeeding twinsOther websitesInformation on nursing multiplesby the author of Mothering Multiples.Breastfeeding Twins and Tripletsby Kathryn Stagg, IBCLCBooksThe Womanly Art Of Breastfeeding.

"Mastitis, blocked ducts, and engorgement",https://laleche.org.uk/mastitis/,"Mastitis (breast inflammation), includes a wide range of symptoms, from a small, tender area (often called a blocked duct), through to severe infection.If your breasts are inflamed or swollen, it’s important to act quickly to relieve discomfort and stop it getting worse. You may also need to deal with any underlying causes.LLL Leadersare here to help.What do all these words mean? A quick guideWhat are the signs of mastitis?Why does it happen?What can I do?Do I need medical help?How can I prevent mastitis in the future?What do all these words mean? A quick guideMastitisjust means ‘breast inflammation’. Recent research is changing how mastitis is viewed and treated. It’s now understood as a wide spectrum, from a small, tender area – often called ablocked duct– to a severe infection.Milk blisters/blebslook like tiny white or yellow dots on the tip of the nipple. They can cause no trouble, or they might be very painful (often described as ‘stinging’ pain). Sometimes they form in one or more ‘milk pores’, blocking milk from coming out of part of the breast. They are part of the mastitis spectrum of related conditions and the self-treatment measures suggested for mastitis may help. Milk blisters thatdon’t block milk coming out, and don’t hurt, can be safely left alone. They eventually disappear.Engorgementis when the whole breast becomes swollen with extra fluid. It’s common 2-5 days after birth, when milk production is increasing very fast. The mastitis self-treatment measures described below are helpful for engorged breasts, too. Treat engorgement promptly to avoid developing mastitis.A breast abscessis a collection of pus (infection) within the breast. It is usually a complication of mastitis that was not adequately treated. An abscess needs urgent medical treatment: drainage and antibiotics.What are the signs of mastitis?One or more areas that are tender (sometimes called a blocked duct).Your breast might feel warmer, harder, or lumpier than usual.There may be a patch of skin on your breast that has changed colour (dark skin might look darker than usual, on light skin you might see a red patch).You might have a fever and feel like you have the flu. Your body may respond to inflammation with an increase in temperature — it doesn’t necessarily mean you have an infection. See below, “Do I need medical help?”Could it be a breast abscess?Most (though not all) people with an abscess feel very ill. If you have one or more lumps in your breast that don’t get smaller as milk is removed, and don’t respond to the treatments for mastitis suggested in this article, contact your GP or NHS 111. An abscess needs urgent medical treatment. It’s usually possible — and may be preferable — to continue breastfeeding while an abscess is treated, if you want to. LLL Leaders can support you through it.Why does it happen?When breasts are too full of milk, or the breast is injured, your body may react with inflammation – a response to a threat. Blood flow to the area increases, and fluids and immune cells rush in to repair damage and fight off bacteria. As pressure within the breast increases, it feels tender or painful, and it may become difficult for the milk to flow easily.Common causes of mastitisIssues withpositioning and attachment:Your baby is not removing milk efficiently.Scheduling or limiting feeds:If breasts aren’t relieved as often as they need to be, this can result in mastitis (and decreased milk production). The amount of milk breasts can hold – and how long they can comfortably hold it for – varies hugely between individuals, and changes over time.Oversupply:Having a lot more milk than you need. Sometimes it’s caused by ‘overpumping’. Sometimes it just happens – this is more likely with second or subsequent babies. Your baby may get upset, gag, and splutter when your milk releases. They are probably growing very fast. Your breast/s may feel uncomfortably full a lot of the time. If you’re struggling with oversupply, LLL Leaders can help.Suddenly removing less milk than usual:For example, because your baby is ill, sleeping longer, or you are away from your baby.Weaning:If you reduce the amount you breastfeed faster than your breasts can manage.Less common causes of mastitisBreast injury, e.g. from a too-tight bra, bag or sling strap, breast pump, or seatbelt. Or even sleeping on your stomach.Bacterial infection in the breast,possibly through an open nipple wound.Factors that may make mastitis more likely:SmokingPrevious breast surgery, such as implantsBeing under a lot more stress than usual, or extremely exhaustedBeing anaemic or having other health conditions that make your immune system work less wellGut health. Some experts think that imbalances in the ‘microbiome’ (the bacteria that live in your body) may make some people more likely to get mastitis. The breast has its own microbiome which is affected by many factors, including your diet, antibiotic use, and whether your baby feeds direct at the breast. It’s a developing field of research.Causes of engorgementIn the first few days after birth, you may have more engorgement if you were given extra fluids during labour and birth. But engorgement can happen at any stage of breastfeeding if there’s more milk than your breast/s can comfortably hold. For example, if:your baby is unwell and feeding less than usual, or less than your breasts needyour baby starts sleeping for a longer stretch at nightyou are away from your baby and don’t express as often as your breasts need.My breasts are engorged, or I think I’ve got mastitis – what do I need to do?Start treatment at the first signs of breast swelling or inflammation. It’s often possible to deal with it at home without medical help.Take standard doses of an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicationsuch as ibuprofen, if you can usually take it. Paracetamol may also be helpful if you’re in pain, but ibuprofen is more useful for mastitis, because it also reduces inflammation. Both are safe to take while breastfeeding.Experiment with cold or cool compresseson the affected area/s between feeds, to see what helps you feel most comfortable.  Some cultures and communities advise new mothers to avoid cold in the early week after birth, and to use heat instead — if this is the case for you, see “things to avoid”, below.Remove milk as often as you need to, to keep the breast as comfortable as you can.Feed your baby whenever they want to be fed or continue expressing whenever you would usually express. Offer a feed or express some milk if your breast feels very full and uncomfortable.Rest as much as you can.Inflammation is tiring for your whole body. Those who have had mastitis often say that they got it when they were under extra stress, or busier than usual – it may be a sign that you need to slow down. Rest is an important part of healing. Taking time off work, or having a partner or support person help you care for your baby can be useful for a few days.Experiment with different feeding positions.This may help you be more comfortable and help to drain different areas of the breast.Some experts recommend takingprobiotics,or the food supplementlecithin.Check with your healthcare provider, a breastfeeding supporter, or LLL websites for current information.Contact an LLL Leaderoryour local LLL groupfor more information and support.Things to avoidSome of the treatments that used to be recommended for mastitis don’t help, and may even make things worse:Rough massage of your breasts.This can increase inflammation – and really hurts! If you want to massage while feeding or expressing, use gentle touch, as if you were stroking a cat.Applying a lot of heat, e.g. hot showers or compresses.Heat can increase inflammation.  If a little warmth helps the milk to flow when you’re feeding or expressing, or helps you feel more comfortable between feeds, use it for as short a time as possible. Don’t direct a hot shower straight at your breast.Electric toothbrushes, combs or other devices.Trying to force milk out of the breast won’t fix the inflammation and may make it worse.Trying to remove a lot more milk than usual.This can increase the amount of milk you’re producing, increasing pressure in the breast. If you need to express more milk than your baby wants, aim to express just enough to be comfortable – not every available drop.My breasts feel full but I can’t get milk out – help!Babies sometimes refuse to feed on a breast that has mastitis.The milk is safe for your baby but may taste different from usual. Your baby may also be objecting to a slower flow of milk – some people notice a temporary supply dipduring mastitis. It usually goes back to normal when the breast has recovered. You will need to express milk from the affected breast until your baby is willing to feed on it again.SeeNursing Strikesfor ideas to encourage your baby to feed.What if your baby will feed, or you’re trying to express, but little or no milk is coming out?Don’t panic!Engorgement or mastitis can act like a traffic jam in the breast.These tips can help you get the milk moving again:Treat the inflammationby taking ibuprofen and perhaps applying a cold compress about 20-30 minutes before you feed or express.If your baby is struggling to attach because the whole breast is engorged (full and tight), tryexpressing a little milkbefore offering the breast to your baby. Or try‘reverse pressure softening’: press firmly around the nipple with fingertips or finger lengths for about one minute before feeding. This moves swelling away from the nipple.Try gentle ‘lymphatic drainage’ massage (towards your armpit). See Further Reading.Do I need medical help?If you’re feeling okay in yourself (you don’t have a fever or feel ill), you can try treating yourself at home for 24 hours. If by that time your symptoms are improving, you can continue for another 24 hours.Contact NHS 111 or your GP straight away if:Your symptoms are the same after 24 hours, or getting worseYou start to feel ill – shivery, shaky, like you have fluYou have a feverA patch on your breast has changed colour and is getting larger, or you see streaks on your breastYou see signs of infection, such as a wound that looks crusty or oozes yellow, or your nipple is a different shape, size, or colour from normal.You may need antibiotics. TheNHS guideline on mastitissays that you should usually be given a 10-14 day course (if you have a shorter course, the mastitis is more likely to come back). If you need antibiotics, it’s important to keep up with the self-help treatments above, as well as taking the medication. Let your doctor know if you’re still not feeling any better by the third day after starting antibiotics.How can I prevent mastitis in the future?Get breastfeeding help if you need it.A breastfeeding supporter can help you get your baby deeply and comfortably attached at the breast.Keep your milk flowing.Avoid too much milk building up in your breasts: feed or express as much as your baby wants, and offer extra feeds or express some milk if your breasts become uncomfortable at other times. If you have a lot more milk than you need, a breastfeeding supporter can help.Check your breast comfort.Make sure nothing is pressing on the breast (see above, “Why does it happen?”)Watch out for early signs of mastitisand start self-help measures right away.Mastitis can be horrible, and make you question whether you can carry on breastfeeding. It’s important not to suddenly stop removing milk while you’ve got mastitis, as this can lead to complications. You need plenty of practical and emotional support, and good medical care if necessary, until you’re feeling better.Written by Jayne Joyce and Justice ReillyLast updated June 2024Further ReadingA Sudden End to BreastfeedingComfortable BreastfeedingDummies & BreastfeedingEngorged Breasts – Avoiding & TreatingExpressing Your MilkHand Expression of BreastmilkHow Milk Production WorksMy Baby Won’t BreastfeedPositioning & AttachmentRhythms & RoutinesSleep Baby – Why and What To DoTongue-tie & BreastfeedingToo Much Milk & OversupplyWhen a Mother is UnwellLa Leche League International article on mastitis:https://llli.org/breastfeeding-info/mastitis/ReferencesMastitisBaeza, C. et al. 2022.

My baby needs more milk,https://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-needs-more-milk/,"Does your baby need more milk?How to know your baby is getting enough breastmilkIncreasing your milk productionIf supplements are neededFeeding methodsExpressing your milkDoes your baby need more milk?Although most mothers are able to produce enough milk for their babies’ needs, you may have concerns about your own milk production. Perhaps you and your baby had a difficult start, or were not given the support you needed to establish breastfeeding. Or maybe things were going well until your baby’s weight gain faltered.If others question your milk production and your baby is fussy, wants to feed much of the time, seems small, or gains weight slowly, you may be wondering whether you have enough milk.Follow your baby not the bookYoung babies need to nurse frequently to get enough milk and establish their mother’s milk production. Following feeding schedules, using regular supplements, nipple shields, or a dummy can really reduce your milk production.Breastmilk is also a drink and frequent nursing is normal. Adults rarely go longer than two hours without a drink, snack or meal. Your baby’s tummy is tiny and breastmilk is quickly digested, so they need frequent feeds to help them grow. It is recommended that your baby is weighed no more than once a month for the first six months, unless there are concerns.Sleepy BabyA baby who sleeps a lot rather than waking to feed every 2–3 hours may need to be woken up to  nurse, particularly if they have jaundice or aren’t gaining enough weight. If this is difficult or your baby is lethargic, ask your midwife, health visitor or GP to check that all is well.See our articleSleepy Baby – why and what to dofor more information.How to know your baby is getting enough breastmilkWeight gainIt is normal for newborns to lose up to 7% of their birth weight in the first few days. Once your milk production increases, usually on day 3–4, expect your baby to begin gaining weight. Most babies regain their birth weight by the age of 10–14 days. You may also find it helpful to seeIs my baby getting enough milk?Plot your baby’s weight gain on a UK–WHO growth chart based on the growth rates of breastfed babies (see examples below and Further Reading). Although they will be growing at their own individual rate, it will give you an indication of how they are doing.Monitor your baby’s weight over a period of time rather than week by week. Your baby’s weight may generally follow the chart, or climb up, crossing the percentile lines. A gradual drop from one percentile line to the next (or the equivalent distance) is unlikely to be a problem unless their weight is low for their age. Heavier newborns often show ‘catch-down’ growth – they gain weight steadily but drop gradually against the chart lines.Dropping against the chart is more of a worry for lower weight babiesIf your baby’s growth curve drops across two lines of the chart (or the equivalent distance), or if their weight is below the lowest line of the chart:Follow the suggestions here to ensure they get more milk.Seek help from your GP to rule out an underlying medical reason for your baby’s slow weight gain.If you have doubts about your baby’s growth, you may find it reassuring to talk to an LLL Leader.Wet and dirty nappiesIf your baby receives enough milk, the thick and sticky black meconium poos will be passed within three days of birth, followed by at least 6–8 wet and 3–5 dirty nappies in each 24 hours. Expect yellow, loose, unformed poos at least the size of a 2p coin. From about six weeks, some babies have abundant poos once every few days. This isn’t a problem when a baby has plenty of wet nappies.Look at your babyYou may instinctively know how your baby is doing. Are they nursing vigorously? Is their skin firm? Do they look healthy and seem active and alert? Are they meeting developmental milestones?RememberEven if your breasts feel empty, there’s always some milk there.Full breasts and engorgement slow milk production – you may need to nurse more often. Removing even small amounts of milk from soft breasts increases milk production.Babies nurse for comfort as well as for food. Those little ‘snack’ comfort feeds can really increase your milk production and their calorie intake.Expect your baby to want to breastfeed very often from time to time.Your breasts will quickly adjust to making more milk if you follow your baby’s cues.Every baby has a unique feeding pattern.If your baby is gaining weight adequately, following their own feeding pattern is the best way of ensuring you are meeting their needs. It’s rare that a mother cannot produce enough milk for her baby, and there are lots of ways to increase the amount of breastmilk your baby gets.Increasing your milk productionAfter the first few weeks, supply and demand drives milk production. To increase your milk supply,  focus on feeding more often and getting more milk out at each feed. For more information about how breasts make milk, see our articleHow milk production worksand alsoHow to increase your milk supply.Breastfeeding basicsBreastfeed as often as possible – at least 10 times in 24 hours. Wake your baby if necessary.Switch sides when your baby’s suck-swallow pattern starts to slow. Continue to switch sides (four times or more) until they reject the breast.Use breast compression (see below).Instead of breastfeeding at set intervals, encourage ‘cluster feeding’ – breastfeeding very often at times when your baby is willing to.Encourage breastfeeding for comfort as well as for food. It can really help your milk production. Stop using dummies – breastfeed instead.Ensure you are meeting your baby’s needs for milk during the night, feeding at least once every four hours.Cut back a little on your baby’s solid foods if your milk production is dropping (see below).An effective latchA baby may spend a long time at the breast but not get very much milk if they are not latched on effectively. Check your baby is well attached – watch and listen for swallowing which is frequent at the start and then slows down.Contact an LLL Leader for one-to-one support and see Further Reading for more information. It’s important to seek skilled help early on if you are finding breastfeeding difficult, uncomfortable or painful.Take a ‘baby moon’Get some help with the housework and eat simple, easily-prepared meals for a week or two so you can concentrate on breastfeeding your baby. A couple of days’ bed rest together, feeding your baby on demand can really boost your milk production. Or at least take some time each day to rest with them and concentrate on breastfeeding.Try laid-back breastfeedingMany babies instinctively seek the breast and feed frequently if they can snuggle up close to their mother’s chest.Try letting your baby lie on your body, skin to skin (with a blanket if needed) as you recline, so both their chest and tummy are against you.This close body contact gives your baby lots of opportunity to breastfeed, even in a light sleep, and boosts levels of the hormones that increase your milk. A soft carrier or sling helps to keep your baby close and encourages breastfeeding. (seePositioning and Attachmentfor more on laid back breastfeeding)Breast compressionThis technique puts pressure on the milk ducts and can help to make feeding more efficient:Support your breast with one hand – thumb on one side, fingers on the other.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, their jaw moving all the way to their ear. When their swallowing slows, compress your breast firmly to increase milk flow and encourage swallowing. Hold it squeezed while they continue nursing actively, then release your hand.Rotate your hand around the breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast.Go gently – this should not hurt.Other foodsBabies need only human milk for the first six months (human milk is higher in calories than many weaning foods). Too much solid food replacing human milk can affect weight gain in older babies.  Breastfeed before offering solid foods if your baby is under 12 months old. Even at 12 months, both human milk and solids are equally important. Breastfeed frequently and, rather than spoon-feeding, offer your baby a variety of foods, letting them feed themselves to ensure they take only what they need.Continued low milk productionIf you’ve tried all these suggestions and your milk production has not increased enough, there may be a medical reason. Some medical conditions can lead to low milk production, though appropriate treatment can reduce the impact. These situations are rare, but you can discuss possibilities with an LLL Leader. For more information see our articleHow to increase your milk supplyand Further Reading.Signs your milk is increasingWatch for weight gain and an increase in your baby’s wet and dirty nappies. Your breasts may feel fuller before feeds and begin to leak.Looking after yourselfDon’t forget to be kind to yourself, especially if you’re feeling under pressure. Now is the time to call in favours from friends and relatives so you can concentrate on your baby. If your baby needs more milk, talking to your local LLL Leader will help. You can share your concerns with other mothers at an LLL meeting, who will be able to give you encouragement and support.If supplements are neededIt can be a challenge fitting in breastfeeding, supplementing and expressing. You could try the following approach, aiming for at least 8 feeds in 24 hours. At each feed:Start with breastfeeding, observing your baby’s swallowing pattern. Use breast compressions to maximise the flow. When swallowing slows, switch sides and repeat. If your baby has enough energy, you can repeat this process (known as ‘switch nursing’). This part of the feed might take 10–30 minutes, but use swallowing as your guide. A baby who is not swallowing isn’t taking in any milk so move to step 2.Give your supplementwith a spoon, syringe,nursing supplementer, finger feeding tube, orbottle. Give stored breastmilk first, then supplement with other milk. Follow your baby’s lead until they are satisfied. A baby who is underweight may become extra hungry for a while. By giving them extra milk, you will help them gain weight and get the energy they need to breastfeed better. To save time, this step could be done by your support person while you express. For more on ways to give your baby more milk, see our article onBottles and other tools.Express both breastsusing a combination of pumping and hand expression, switching back and forth as milk flow slows. Store this milk in the fridge ready for the next feed. By removing the milk your baby couldn’t, you build your future milk production and have milk to supplement the next feed. This is an important step, especially if you are working to eliminate formula supplements.Finish at the breast.The whole feed may take 60–90 minutes. If it works for you, you might offer the breast at the end of the feed so your baby associates the breast with being calm, happy and satisfied. Suckling can help them settle to sleep, too.Keep a record of the amounts of each supplement your baby takes at each feed and also what you express. This can help you see your progress and maybe useful for anyone supporting you with breastfeeding.Feeding methodsCup, spoon and syringe feedingcan work when small amounts are needed.Anursing supplementercan be used to give larger amounts while your baby is at the breast. Another option isfinger feeding, using an infant feeding tube. One end of the tube is taped to your finger. As your baby sucks on your finger, milk flows along the tube from a container which can be raised or lowered to change flow. An LLL Leader can help you find out more and choose an option that works best for you.If using a bottle,paced bottle feedingcan help ensure your baby doesn’t take more milk than they need.A smaller teat hole prevents a baby taking milk too quickly.Hold them in an upright position, using your hand to support their neck and head.To encourage your baby to open wide, place the teat across their lips with the tip between the upper lip and nose.Allow your baby some control. Let them take the bottle teat into their mouth themself. Avoid pushing the teat into their mouth.Tilt the bottle just enough to fill the tip of the teat and give a gentle flow so your baby isn’t overwhelmed with milk. As the bottle empties, gradually tilt the bottle more and lean your baby back.Encourage frequent pauses to mimic breastfeeding, and allow your baby to decide when they have had enough.For more information seeBottles and other tools.Expressing your milkA baby nursing well at the breast is more effective than any pump. But while your baby isn’t breastfeeding well or you’re giving supplements, expressing your milk will stimulate milk production. Give any expressed milk before you give infant formula, so none of your precious breastmilk is wasted.Nurse your baby frequently so they get the extra milk you make. An increase in the amount you can express is a sign that you can reduce supplements if your baby is nursing well and often.Hospital-grade pumps are the most effective for mothers needing to increase their milk, but any pump that works well for you is fine.Try hands-on pumping: use breast massage and breast compressions while pumping, then hand express afterwards to get the last few drops of milk. For more on hand expressing see our article:Hand expressionPumping on both sides at the same time boosts milk-producing hormones. When pumping one side at a time, switch back and forth several times as milk flow slows.Consider power pumping: experiment with pumping very frequently for short periods to mimic cluster feeding.Wash your pump with hot soapy water, or sterilise it once a day. Pump equipment can be left at room temperature for short periods, or stored in the fridge for longer periods. For more information, see our articleExpressing Your Milk.Good times to express milkAfter feeds while your baby sleeps – ‘putting in an order’ for more milk later. Milk expressed after a feed may be small in quantity, but is high in calories.Between feeds if your baby is too sleepy to nurse frequently.While holding your baby, or with them nearby. Expressing little and often can be better than long sessions. Try some ‘power pumping’ during the evening, or fit in some extra pumping sessions one day. You should notice an increase in milk production a couple of days later.Using donor milk and formula to support breastfeedingThe use of donor milk or infant formula is sometimes essential to meet a baby’s nutritional needs. You may need to use donor milk or formula as a short-term measure while you work to increase your milk production. See our articleUsing donor milk & formula to support breastfeedingfor more information.Supplementing with donor milk or formula without protecting your milk supply may reduce the duration of your breastfeeding journey.Powdered infant formula is not a sterile product. To reduce health risks associated with using infant formula, carefully follow the NHS guidelines for preparing it. La Leche League does not recommend the use of homemade formula.

Oversupply,https://laleche.org.uk/too-much-milk-and-oversupply/,"While it’s good to have plenty of milk, some mothers produce more milk than their babies need. This is usually called oversupply.Some babies cope very well with a generous milk supply; however, others will be unhappy and uncomfortable even though they are gaining weight and appearing to thrive. Oversupply can also make feeding uncomfortable and increase the risk of mastitis.Symptoms of oversupplyHow does oversupply happen?How is your milk supply established?A note about foremilk and hindmilkWhat can I do about the symptoms of oversupply?Reducing your milk supplyIf you still have problemsBreast compressionAdjusting to the new normalSymptoms of oversupplyThe main symptoms of oversupply for a baby are:Very fast weight gain, moving upwards through centile linesExplosive green frothy poosStruggling to control milk flowPain and excessive wind or ‘gas’You may also notice the following:Choking, coughing, and pulling on and off the breastClamping down and biting to slow the flow of milkFrequent spitting upAlways appearing hungry and unsatisfied despite large weight gainUnwillingness to nurse to sleepBreast refusalFaltering weight gain due to breast refusalLots of wet and dirty nappiesGeneral ‘colicky’ behaviourA mother with oversupply may have the following symptoms:Breasts that are rarely soft or comfortableA forceful or ‘over-active’ letdown (milk ejection reflex)A painful letdownA lot of leakingPainful nipplesas a result of clamping down and bitingRecurring blocked ducts and/or mastitisSome of these symptoms may have other causes; allergies and reflux, for example, can have similar symptoms to oversupply. They may also fall within the normal range. Therefore, it is important to rule out other possibilities before taking steps to reduce your milk supply, as this can have longer term consequences.How does oversupply happen?Some mothers naturally produce large quantities of milk, and we tend to produce more milk with each baby. Occasionally, there are medical reasons for having much more milk than your baby needs. Oversupply can also occur as a result of breastfeeding management, for example, when a baby’s feeds are scheduled, or if a mother is told to feed from each breast for a certain amount of time. It can happen if a pump is used too often, or used in a way that overstimulates the breast.Milk production is best regulated by your baby’s appetite. When you breastfeed responsively, rather than by following a schedule, your milk production adapts to their needs. Occasionally, a poor latch can contribute to oversupply as a baby might feed very frequently to get the volume they need. However, this tends to reduce milk supply over time.How is your milk supply established?After your baby is born, milk production is regulated on a supply and demand basis. Put simply, the more milk you remove, the more milk you are likely to make. How quickly or slowly milk is made depends on the fullness of the breast – an ‘empty’ breast makes milk more quickly, a full breast makes milk more slowly.It takes a few weeks for your supply to settle down to what your baby actually needs. It is not unusual in the early weeks to feel as if you have too much milk, and to have times when the breasts feel full or even engorged. This is not the same as oversupply.Feeding frequently and removing milk from the breasts is essential to resolvingengorgement– it won’t make the engorgement worse or result in too much milk.Babies usually nurse more during developmental leaps and growth spurts, and many mothers find there are changes to their baby’s nursing pattern during holidays and family get-togethers, or during periods of stress. Milk supply is very adaptable – if you follow your baby and your body, your supply will most likely regulate itself.Read more abouthow milk production works.A note about foremilk and hindmilkOne of the symptoms of oversupply in a baby is green frothy poos, gas, and pain. This is sometimes calledlactose overloador aforemilk-hindmilk imbalance.You may be given confusing information about foremilk and hindmilk, and how long a feed ‘should’ last. Or think that there are two different kinds of milk – lower-fat and fat-rich – and that one is better than the other.Typically, thefat contentdoesincrease during a feed, as the fat globules tend to be drawn down towards the end of a feed. However, it is not the length of a feed that is important, but the length of timebetweenfeeds. Fat content is determined mostly by the fullness of the breast. If there is a long gap between feeds and the breast is full, the baby may get a large quantity of lower-fat milk before much of the fat starts getting pulled down. The same may be true if a mother naturally produces very large quantities of milk. In the absence of fat-rich milk, the lower-fat milk moves through the gut faster than it can be digested, causing green poos, gas, and pain.All breastmilk is good!What matters most to weight gain is overall milk volume.What can I do about the symptoms of oversupply?To start with, you might like to:adjust your position and your baby’s attachment to help them manage a fast letdownfeed responsively (as often as your baby wants) and/or offer more frequent feedsuse breast massageavoid overpumpingManaging a Fast letdownA fast letdown can beonesymptom of oversupply. It is possible to have a fast letdown with an ‘average’ milk production. When your baby nurses, a hormonal reflex causes milk to release, (what is known as ‘letdown’). When this happens, it is not unusual for milk to spray out quickly. Some babies like this fast flow, but others are upset by it and struggle to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. You may find it helpful to:Ensure that your baby isdeeply attached at the breast. This will make it easier for them to manage a fast flow.Try different positions. Some parents use gravity to help them by feeding in a ‘laid-back’ (reclined) position. Others find it helps to feed in a more upright position such as a ‘koala hold’, or to feed while using a sling or baby carrier. Side-lying may also be helpful as excess milk can easily leak out.Allow your baby to come off the breast when they need to catch their breath, and use a muslin to catch the spray.Some mothershand expressa little to slow the flow before bringing the baby to the breast (however, if this is done frequently, it may make oversupply worse).If your breast is very full and engorged, you might try ‘reverse pressure softening’ to move fluids away from the nipple area as this can help your baby to latch more deeply.Feed frequently so that the milk spray doesn’t have quite so much volume and force behind it.Try breastfeeding before your baby is really hungry, or while they are slightly sleepy.Responsive feedingHow do you know how often or how long to feed your baby for? Let your baby tell you! We all have different milk storage capacities and this may determine how frequently your baby feeds, and whether they feed from one side or two. Allow your baby to feed from the first breast for as long as they want to before offering the second breast – they may or may not take it.Sometimes babies will only take one breast, and sometimes two (or three or four!). Most babies will take both breasts, at least some of the time. Babies are very good at letting us know how often they want to feed, and if in doubt, it is always fine to offer.Breast massageYou could do what is sometimes called the ‘breast milkshake’. This involves massaging each breast very gently for half a minute or so before feeding, then using a combination of massage and breast compression (see below) during a feed to help dislodge some of the fat. Any massage should use a light fingertip pressure such as you would use to apply body lotion.ExpressingOveruse of pumps – or using a pump in a way that unintentionally stimulates milk production (such as a silicone pump to collect dripping milk) – can make oversupply worse. If you’ve beenexpressingregularly, reduce this gradually to avoid further problems.Reducing your milk supplyIf your baby is gaining more weight than average and you and your baby are happy, then you don’t need to change anything. It is not possible to overfeed a breastfed baby.If you or your baby are struggling with some of the above symptoms, you have ruled out other causes and changes to breastfeeding management do not help, then you may want to consider taking steps to gradually slow milk production.Consult an LLL Leaderbefore using these approaches. This is especially important if your baby is under one month old, or you are experiencing other problems such as sore nipples or mastitis.Monitor your baby’s weight gain to ensure it doesn’t drop below expected levels, and keep a close eye on nappy output.One side per feedLimit your baby to one breast per feed. If your baby wants to have a short rest during a feed, then offer the same breast again. When a mother has a generous milk storage capacity, their baby may only need to feed on one side. This approach may help milk production to reduce in line with their baby’s demand.Block feedingBlock feeding involves feeding on the same side for a set period of time (block), e.g. for two or three hours. If your baby wants to feed again within that time block, offer the same side. As a starting point, you might like to:Limit your baby to one breast for about two hours, allowing them to nurse as often and for as long as they like, but only on that one side.Continue in this way, switching breasts every two hours. If your baby is asleep, switch breasts when they wake.It is important not to have a rigid approach to block feeding: read your breasts and your baby, not just the clock. By doing this, you will find the time block that works best for both of you. If the unused breast feels uncomfortably full before the next feed then ‘express to comfort’only.It is possible to experience oversupply in just one breast, in which case you could nurse for longer periods on the unaffected side.Full drainage and block feeding methodFor more severe oversupply – for example, if you are suffering from recurrent blocked ducts or mastitis and your breasts never feel soft and comfortable even after a breastfeed – you will need to keep your breasts well drained while you take steps to reduce milk production.You could try the following, in consultation with an infant feeding specialist, in addition to block feeding:Express from both sides thoroughly to ‘empty’ your breasts as fully as possible.After expressing, immediately offer both ‘empty’ breasts to your baby.Next, limit your baby to one breast changing sides every two or three hours (see block feeding above).Some mothers will need to use this approach only once. However, if your breasts feel uncomfortably full, you may need to repeat it, increasing the interval between each pump for your breasts to readjust.Medications and herbs to reduce milk productionThere are herbs and medications that can help dry up your milk production. Talk with your health care provider or a lactation consultant.If you still have problemsAfter 4–7 days, your breasts may be more comfortable. If you and your baby still have trouble coping with the supply of milk, you can gradually increase the time block you keep your baby to one breast. Some women with extreme oversupply have gone as long as six or more hours before switching breasts to adjust milk production. A hormonal imbalance may cause overproduction of milk, but this is rare. A visit to your doctor may be helpful if the suggestions offered here aren’t enough.Block feeding should be a temporary measure. In practice, it is suggested that it is done for no more than one week, and only when babies are gaining double (or more) the average weight for their age. Once supply has settled, you can return to a more normal feeding pattern, following and trusting your baby and your body.Breast compressionBabies used to a generous milk flow can become fussy at the breast when milk flow slows. They may have to work harder at the breast and deepen their latch to remove milk effectively. Breast compression will increase milk flow and encourage your baby to keep feeding actively:Support your breast with one hand – thumb on one side, fingers on the other.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively (slow, rhythmic sucking, lots of swallowing). When their swallowing slows, compress your breast gently to increase milk flow and encourage swallowing. Hold it squeezed while they continue nursing actively, then release your hand.Rotate your hand around your breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast as needed. Be gentle – this shouldn’t hurt.Adjusting to the new normalAlways monitor your baby’s weight gain, wet and dirty nappies, and overall well-being while following these strategies. Monitor their weight over a period of several weeks to see a trend. If your baby had been gaining weight very quickly, you may see ‘catch-down’ growth. Your baby will gain weight steadily, but may gradually drop against the percentile lines as your milk production adjusts. Their weight should then settle into following a new percentile line on the chart.As your supply reduces, your breasts will feel softer and more comfortable, and leaking will be reduced. Soft comfortable breasts between feeds during the early weeks are normal and a sign that your milk production is in tune with your baby’s needs.Written by Charlotte AllamLast updated May 2023Kimberly Seals Allers’ photos on this site are used under a creative commons license of Black Breastfeeding 360°http://mochamanual.com/bb/Further ReadingMastitisEngorged Breasts – Avoiding & TreatingHand Expression of BreastmilkIs My Baby Getting Enough MilkComfortable BreastfeedingRhythms & RoutinesThe Unhappy Breastfed BabyRefluxAllergies and IntolerancesFat Content of Breastmilk – FAQsPositioning and AttachmentOther websitesUK–WHO Growth Charts:www.rcpch.ac.uk/growthchartsBlock Feeding Dos and Don’ts:http://www.nancymohrbacher.com/articles/2013/10/9/block-feeding-dos-donts.html?rq=oversupplyBooksThe Womanly Art Of Breastfeeding.
