Nursing strikes,https://laleche.org.uk/nursing-strikes/,"What is a nursing strike?If a baby who has been quite happily breastfeeding suddenly starts to refuse the breast it could be a “nursing strike”. Sometimes this can be mistaken for the baby wanting to stop breastfeeding, but a baby who is ready to wean usually does so over a period of time. In nursing strikes the baby seems unwilling to feed even though he appears really unhappy about it.Something happens which makes your baby not want to feed and it can take time and patience to help them return to the breast. Nursing strikes are nearly always a temporary reaction to something which has happened and the cause may never be discovered.1What might cause a nursing strike?The term nursing strike relates to an older baby who suddenly refuses to feed. If you have a newborn baby who is not feeding, please refer to our article aboutWhen my baby won’t breastfeedfor more information.Sometimes the cause is physical:The baby might have a stuffy nose or earache which is making feeding uncomfortable.They might have a sore throat or mouth. Some mothers have found a little injury such as a cut in their baby’s mouth or an ulcer which hadn’t been noticed.Hand, foot and mouth disease or chickenpox can cause a nursing strike as it is so uncomfortable to feed.They could have sore gums from teething, a thrush infection or even a urinary tract infection.They may be uncomfortable from a vaccination.They might be frustrated at a low milk supply or a change in milk taste due to something the mother has ingested. An oversupply of milk could also sometimes scare a baby who finds the flow overwhelming.Sometimes the cause is emotional:A common cause of a sudden nursing strike is the baby being startled in some way while nursing, perhaps by a loud noise or by a mother involuntarily exclaiming when the baby bites.A mother may have been feeling stressed because of moving house, having visitors, travelling or dealing with a family crisis and put off nursing and the baby senses her distraction.A mother has changed her deodorant, soap, body lotion or perfume and so smells “different” to her baby.A new job may have meant a change in nursing habits or the baby being left with another carer for longer periods of time. Attempts to regulate nursing or offering too many bottles or dummies could also contribute to a baby refusing to breastfeed.What can help end a nursing strike?If illness or injury might be the cause, then consulting a doctor about medication could be useful.Some babies will nurse, sometimes reluctantly, at night. Trying to nurse the baby in their sleep or when they are sleepy can work: it keeps them fed and helps with your milk supply.Trying to force your baby to feed won’t work and a baby will often get upset if a mother tries. Although it’s hard, being relaxed and offering cuddles and skin-to-skin contact helps keep you feeling close.Sing or rock the baby with your shirt open so perhaps they will relax and instinctively latch on.Sitting in a quiet room with dimmed lights and no distractions may help.Try taking a bath together.If you can get help around the house and with other children it means you can spend more time just relaxing with the baby.Try nursing somewhere different, while walking around, using a baby sling, sitting in the car, outside or at a friend’s house.  You can also try a completely different position such as facing you or vertical. Some mothers have tried facing away from a room so that the baby can see what is happening while nursing.Rocking, dancing or doing the “baby bounce” (starting small but getting bouncier and bouncier) while holding him in a nursing position might help. Some babies love this, others don’t.Stimulate your let-down and get your milk flowing before offering the breast so the baby gets an immediate reward. You can also offer the baby something else to suck before offering to nurse so he is in “sucking” mode!If the baby continues to get upset when offered the breast it is sometimes necessary to stop offering for a day or two and let things settle down. You can then make it clear that your breast is available without forcing the issue.See the section below on milk supply for suggestions on preventing a drop in your milk production.If a baby has a sore mouth, some mothers have found offering breastmilk ice lollies before a feed can help to numb the mouth and make nursing more comfortable.  Expressed breastmilk can also be frozen in cubes and offered in a clean cloth/muslin to suck on.  This can be useful for a teething baby. Other mothers have offered a child analgesic as appropriate before trying to nurse.Sometimes these ideas will need to be repeated for a few days before things get back to normal.Here are a couple of unusual ideas to tryOne solution that has worked for some mothers is to sit on an office chair, holding the baby in your lap but not at your breast.  Ask someone to spin the chair around; not too fast but until you feel a little dizzy, and then offer the breast. It seems that being a little disorientated stimulates a natural instinct to go to the breast.Something which has also worked is for the mother to pretend to nurse a doll or cuddly toy, causing the baby to want his comfort back from the intruder!What about my milk supply during a strike?It’s natural to want to give the baby lots of other food and drink while they aren’t nursing. As as long as they are healthy, continue to offer their usual food and water but don’t rush to replace all their nursing needs with extra food immediately.Pumpingorhand expressingwill maintain your milk supplyand help prevent you from getting uncomfortably full, which might lead toplugged ducts or mastitis.If the nursing strike continues for more than a day you can offer expressed milk in a cup, eye-dropper, feeding syringe or spoon. It is best to avoid bottles as they can causenipple confusion.Nursing strikes are distressing for mother and babyIt can be really upsetting and frightening to have a baby who has suddenly lost their main food source, their biggest comfort and a lovely way to fall asleep. You want to comfort your baby but they turn away. It can help to remember that your baby isn’t rejecting you. They don’t understand why breastfeeding is uncomfortable, they just think it is causing discomfort and they are scared to try it again, even if the original problem is sorted out.Almost all nursing strikes are temporary and end happily, although not necessarily quickly. Some mothers have reported nursing strikes that lasted almost three weeks, but more often the baby goes back to breastfeeding in a few days.Even if your baby doesn’t immediately return to the breast you can continue to offer for as long as you want to. If it really does turn out to be the end of breastfeeding, allow yourself to be sad and grieve for its sudden ending. Breastfeeding ideally continues until both the mother and baby are ready to stop, but sometimes the baby makes the decision for you both in spite of a mother’s efforts.  (For more on how it feels after your baby weans, you may find this article helpful:After weaning – what next?)Note:If you have a newborn baby who is refusing to feed this is not a nursing strike.See these posts for help orget support from an LLL Leader:My Baby Won’t BreastfeedSleepy Baby: Why and What To DoJaundiceBeginning BreastfeedingIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, 20171  The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding 8thEdition, pages 407-409."

Pwyswch yn ysgafn a sefydlog am tua munud nes bydd cylch o bantiau bychan ar yr areola. Gallwch hefyd wasgu gydag ochrau’ch bysedd. Rhowch eich bawd ar un ochr y deth a dau fys ar yr ochr arall ble bydd gwefusau eich baban. Tynnwch ychydig o laeth â llaw yn araf deg os oes angen.

Mae poen yn arwydd bod angen newid rhywbeth – mynnwch help arbenigol. Nyrsiwch eich baban cyn ei fod wir yn llwgu. Cynigiwch y fron leiaf poenus gyntaf a rhoi cynnig ar safleoedd nyrsio gwahanol. Rhowch eich bys rhwng deintgig eich babi os ydych angen ei dynnu oddi ar y fron. Os bydd eich tethi yn cosi neu’n llosgi neu os teimlwch wayw o boen yn ystod neu rhwng bwydo, holwch arweinydd LLL i helpu canfod yr achos. Help ar gyfer bronnau poenus Gallai cochni, man tyner neu lwmp poenus fod yn ddwythell wedi blocio. Ceisiwch osgoi mastitis trwy nyrsio’n rheolaidd i gadw’r llaeth yn llifo. Defnyddiwch wahanol safleoedd nyrsio a gwirio bod eich babi wedi cydio ar y fron. Gorffwyswch a thrin yn yr un modd ag ar gyfer gorlenwi.Ceisiwch osgoi bras a dillad allai wasgu ar y fron.

Beth bynnag ei bwysau, mae baban ifanc angen nyrsio o leiaf pob 2-3 awr i sefydlu cyflenwad llaeth ei fam ac i gael digon o laeth.Mae nyrsio cyson yn arferol, yn rhannol am fod llaeth y fron yn ddiod yn ogystal â bwyd. Anaml iawn fydd oedolion yn mynd mwy nag ychydig oriau heb ddiod, byrbryd neu bryd. Mae bol eich babi yn fach iawn ac mae llaeth y fron yn cael ei dreulio’n gyflym iawn, felly mae angen bwydo’n gyson i’w helpu i dyfu.Sut i wybod os yw’ch babi’n cael digon o laeth o’r fronMagu pwysauMae babanod newydd-anedig yn aml yn colli hyd at 7% o’u pwysau genedigol yn y dyddiau cyntaf. Unwaith y bydd eich cynhyrchiant llaeth yn cynyddu, fel arfer ar ddiwrnod 3-4, gallwch ddisgwyl i’ch babi ddechrau adennill y pwysau a gollodd. Mae’r rhan fwyaf o fabanod wedi adennill eu pwysau genedigol erbyn 10-14 niwrnod oed. Bydd eich baban yn tyfu dan ei bwysau ei hun, a bydd siart twf yn dangos sut mae’n gwneud (gweler Darllen Pellach). Unwaith y bydd bwydo ar y fron yn mynd yn dda ac nad oes unrhyw bryderon, ni chynghorir pwyso fwy nag unwaith y mis yn y chwe mis cyntaf. Os oes unrhyw bryderon, cadwch lygad ar dueddiadau newid pwysau dros nifer o wythnosau yn hytrach na chanolbwyntio ar un wythnos benodol. Gallai pwysau eich baban godi’n sefydlog a dilyn un llinell ganrannol ar y siart, neu godi’n gynt, gan groesi’r llinellau canrannol. Mae’n annhebyg y bydd cwymp graddol o un llinell ganrannol i’r nesaf (neu bellter cyfatebol) yn broblem oni bai bod ei bwysau yn isel ar gyfer ei oed. Mae twf babanod newydd-anedig trymach yn aml yn ‘arafu’ – sy’n golygu eu bod yn magu pwysau’n araf bach er yn gostwng yn raddol yn erbyn y llinellau canrannol.Mae gostwng yn erbyn y siart yn fwy o ofid ar gyfer babanod pwysau is.

I Think My Baby’s Got Reflux,https://laleche.org.uk/i-think-babys-got-reflux/,"In the early weeks, it is normal for a baby to “spit-up” and around half of all newborns do, at least once a day.  As a baby’s digestive system matures, this usually decreases and for most mothers it is just a short-term inconvenience.1However, in some babies the valve between the stomach and oesophagus does not close properly. The stomach contents flow back into the oesophagus and can cause vomiting. There are several reasons a baby may vomit and a doctor will need to rule out other causes, but one possible diagnosis is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), also referred to as GOR (gastro-oesophageal reflux).Not all reflux is noticeable and it doesn’t always make a baby uncomfortable, but when it’s severe it can be painful and cause distress to mother and baby.2What are the signs to look out for?A baby may choke and cough, or seem to have a sore throat. Some babies have bad breath.A mother may notice back arching and head turning. The baby may stretch out flat as this reduces pain, instead of snuggling close to his mother.A baby may cry for long periods and be irritable during and after feeds. His cries may sound hoarse. This sometimes leads to a misdiagnosis of colic.A baby may seem to fight feeding or even refuse to feed. There may be poor weight gain.What might help?A few things may help lessen pain. Keeping the baby’s head higher than his bottom during feeding can be more comfortable for him/her. Being at a 30 to 40 degree angle with the baby’s bottom in the mother’s lap and his torso supported on the mother’s crossed leg may be one way for the baby to feed more comfortably. If the baby is feeding in a side-lying position then s/he may feed better on the left side; moving the baby over instead of turning him round if changing sides.  It’s preferable to move the baby to a more upright position as soon as possible.3It can be useful to consider “head above bottom” at all times.A baby sling can be helpful for this purpose. A baby with reflux may find it uncomfortable to lay down flat and might cry or spit up when laid in a cot.Some parents choose to keep their baby in their arms or a sling for naps.Others find it helps to keep their baby upright for a period of time after feeds before they lay them down.Changing the baby on his side may be preferable to avoid putting pressure on his stomach when lifting his legs. A lay-back bouncy seat can be useful. Babies with reflux can find travelling in a car seat uncomfortable due to the pressure on their stomachs and some mothers choose to use the car less while it distresses the baby and instead use public transport while carrying the baby in a sling.As the opening from the stomach to the oesophagus is usually on the right side, keeping the right side higher than the left may also help.Short, frequent feeds ease the incidence and discomfort of reflux.4If a mother has a copious milk supply then feeding one side only at each feed may ease discomfort. However, it is worth looking at what seems to suit your baby.What causes reflux?There are several suggestions as to why reflux happens.  It’s sometimes suggested that it’s caused by an immature sphincter muscle5and that this will strengthen as the baby grows.Other studies have shown a link between reflux and allergies, or an intolerance to cows’ milk protein.6A mother could try to remove dairy products from her diet, in consultation with a medical professional, to see if that improves things.One of the biggest causes can be fast-flowing milk or oversupply.  If a baby seems to be choking or gasping because of a fast flow, there are several things to try.  You can take him off the breast for a moment until the flow slows, or feed in a more upright position.Making sure a baby has a deep latch and good tongue function can also make a difference. Tongue-tie can affect a baby’s sucking action and can lead to a baby swallowing too much air. You can find further suggestions here:https://laleche.org.uk/too-much-milk-and-oversupply/https://laleche.org.uk/tongue-tie/https://laleche.org.uk/unhappy-baby/Adding solids to “thicken feeds” has significant drawbacksIt is sometimes suggested that babies with reflux will be helped by adding solids to their diet to thicken feeds. In 2018, a study in the British Medical Journal reported that “Feed thickeners are commonly used for managing infants with GOR despite the lack of strong supporting evidence”.7As most existing studies assessing the efficacy of thickened feeds on reflux symptoms mainly include formula-fed infants, there is limited information available on the potential reduction of regurgitation in breastfed babies.8Aside from the lack of strong evidence, this treatment has some significant drawbacks. Introducing solid food too early replaces human milk, which is nutritionally ideal for babies, with a food of less nutritional value. It will also lower a mother’s milk supply. Regurgitating solids can add to the baby’s distress and discomfort, and introducing solids too early might also trigger allergies in an already sensitive baby.Switching to formula may not be the answerAlthough it is sometimes suggested that breastfeeding mothers change to formula, this may well worsen symptoms. While both breastfed and formula fed babies can experience reflux, research has shown that formula fed infants have episodes of reflux more often than breastfed babies and they last longer.9As one cause of reflux can be a delayed emptying of the stomach, the fact that human milk leaves the stomach twice as quickly as formula means that breastmilk lessens the possibility of reflux.10If nothing seems to workIf a baby continues to be distressed, then a doctor may refer you to a gastroenterologist who may prescribe medications which can help.Something positive?In hisGuide to Breastfeeding,11Dr. Jack Newman, a member of La Leche League International’s Panel of Professional Advisors, explains how breastmilk is full of immune factors that interact with each other and protect the baby from bacteria, viruses and other micro-organisms.They work by forming a protective layer on a baby’s mucous membranes which line the gut, respiratory tract and other areas. This stops micro-organisms from invading the body through these mucous membranes.Dr. Newman explains that a baby who spits up gets double protection, first when the milk goes down to the stomach, and again when he spits it up.If you would like further help and support look for yournearest LLL group or Leader.You can find further information here:www.llli.org/why-infant-reflux-matters/breastfeeding.support/reflux-in-newborns/Written by Anna Burbidge, LLLGB 20191 Nancy Mohrbacher, “Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple.

"Smoking, Vaping, Cannabis and Breastfeeding",https://laleche.org.uk/smoking-vaping-cannabis-breastfeeding/,"When a mum quits smoking, she’s making one of the biggest changes she can to improve her health, and the health of her baby. Any accurate information that those involved in breastfeeding support can give her, will support her to maintain that change. The hardest time to make or maintain behaviour changes are when one is HALT: hungry, angry, lonely or tired – and new mothers often experience some or all of these.[1]Quitting smokingThere is a persistent myth that abruptly quitting smoking may cause harm. In fact, while it may make symptoms such as coughing worse in the short term, this is a sign that the body’s natural responses are recovering and becoming unsuppressed by the effects of smoking. Additionally, abrupt quit is statistically the most successful way to quit smoking.Many people believe that cutting down will provide protection for themselves and their families, but in fact most people will smoke in a compensatory way – taking more, deeper and longer held drags, thereby maintaining the levels of nicotine and other chemicals inhaled.[2]Therefore, when wanting to quit one should use whatever method of quitting you believe will have the best chance of success in your particular case!Will a baby be harmed by their mother quitting smoking abruptly?No. There is evidence that nicotine exposure prenatally and through breastmilk may cause babies to undergo some symptoms of withdrawal when their mothers stop smoking. However, this must be weighed against the health risks to the baby if the mother continues to smoke. If a mother who is quitting smoking chooses to use nicotine replacement therapy while breastfeeding, her baby will receive a tapering dose of nicotine (as product strength and/or frequency of use is reduced), which could help to minimise withdrawal.[3]The components of cigarette smokeThere are three main problematic components in cigarette smoke: tar (the link between smoking and cancer), carbon monoxide (the link with heart disease, stroke and the main cause of damage in unborn babies) and nicotine.Tar passes from the lungs to the bloodstream and is deposited all around the body. I have searched for information about whether tar passes into breastmilk and haven’t been able to find anything relevant. While it may be present in milk, it will certainly be present in second hand smoke. All information confirms that if a mother cannot quit smoking, then breastfeeding is protective against the chemical exposure the baby will be experiencing.Nicotine in concentrated form is a poison – but when you have been regularly been exposed to it your body develops tolerance – the main problem with it in the form that it is in cigarettes is that it is extremely addictive.If one chooses to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), one is using nicotine in a clean form, a less addictive delivery method (the more quickly it gets to your brain, the more addictive it is, and when smoked it takes less than seven seconds), and lower amounts than if smoking is continued – and with a tapering dosage.(In the UK) all NRT is licensed for use in breastfeeding, with the recommendation that using the intermittent products (gum etc.), instead of the patches, allows mothers to minimise nicotine exposure by timing dosage. Nicotine has a half life of around 90 minutes, so smoking or using NRT just after a feed will allow mothers to minimise the nicotine transmitted to the baby.[4]However – the exposure to a small amount of nicotine is hugely less harmful than exposure to continued smoking, so the mother should do whatever best increases her chances of success.When choosing to use NRT, caregivers need to be aware that what is a therapeutic amount of nicotine for them would be a significant overdose for someone who is not used to it – in fact, the residue left in discarded NRT would be enough to cause harm to a baby or child. Occasionally, patches become unstuck from their original owner in bed and stuck on  to other people sharing the space – apparently a part used patch or a piece of gum can make an adult feel like they are having a heart attack, so the effect on a baby would be severe. Just as smoking materials are kept out of reach, pre- and post- use NRT needs to be kept securely away from babies and children.Electronic cigarettes (or vaping)Public Health England has recently released an evidence summary relating to e-cigarettes. Its conclusion is that current evidence indicates that using an e-cigarette is around 95% safer than a conventional cigarette.[5]Using an e-cigarette will not expose a baby to tar or carbon monoxide. Ambient levels of nicotine are much reduced compared with that in the air or household surfaces of a household where cigarette smoking takes place. This is because 85% of smoke released by cigarettes is sidestream smoke – the smoke that is released by a burning cigarette when it is not being smoked.E-cigarettes are regulated by general consumer products law which is enforced by trading standards – this means it is easier for companies to bring products to market with much less testing and control than if products were regulated as medicines – it’s responsive rather than proactive. If you are going to use an e-cigarette, choose one that has a kitemark or CE mark as that gives you a guarantee that what it says on the label is what is in it, and the electrical components are safe.[6]The vapour itself is usually made from propylene glycol and glycerine – and as far as we know that doesn’t cause anything more serious than occasional throat irritation. There is a need for research on long term lung exposure safety.E-cigarettes come in a range of flavours including menthol – peppermint oil is sometimes associated with reduced milk supply. If you are concerned you might check your preferred brand to see if it actually contains peppermint oil or a synthetic. Menthol cigarettes are linked to higher rates of lung cancer, but that is because the mint numbs the throat, enabling smoke to be drawn in deeper/ held longer. That wouldn’t be an issue with e-cigarettes.ASH (Action on Smoking and Health) have a good online factsheet giving an introduction to e-cigarettes:http://ash.org.uk/search/?q=e%20cigarette&x=0&y=0NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) now takes a harm reduction approach to e-cigarettes – they cannot recommend an unlicensed product, but are clear that they are less harmful than smoking. We know that many women quit smoking when pregnant and lapse after their baby has been born.[7]If a mum who has quit smoking conventional cigarettes and is now using an e-cigarette, her baby isn’t being exposed to the chemicals in smoke – she has to weigh up how she feels about maintaining her successful quit versus risk of lapse if she stops using it.Co-sleeping and smoking or vapingMaternal (and to a lesser extent paternal or other parent present in the bed) smoking has long been clearly linked to increased risk of SIDS. Exposure to nicotine damages babies’ ability to develop normal robust neurological processes to protect their breathing and respond if it is compromised. It also decreases lung function and increases sleep related respiratory problems. According to evidence examined by the WHO, it is unclear how much of this risk is down to tobacco smoking during pregnancy damaging the foetus’s development, and how much is down to exposure to second hand smoke after birth.[8]This has implications for where babies sleep when their mothers smoked during pregnancy, even if the mother quit smoking at (or before) birth and is not now smoking. Additionally, sleep changes related to smoking such as apnoeas may take time to resolve after quitting smoking, and these may make the mother less responsive to her baby.Cannabis and breastfeedingMost times, cannabis is smoked together with tobacco – this means that all the health impact of tobacco is present, only with the additional effect that when joints are smoked, each inhalation is usually taken deeper and held for longer. This increases the lung exposure to harm. Because of the higher levels of oil in cannabis, it is usually estimated that each joint smoked is the equivalent of 5-7 cigarettes.[9]The effects of cannabis in breastmilk on babies’ development are controversial. Some studies indicate that there is no impact on babies’ long term development, others find that motor development at the age of one is slightly reduced in babies who were regularly exposed.[10]Additionally, most babies who are exposed to THC (see below) via breastmilk will also have been exposed foetally, making it difficult to determine what changes have occurred when.[11]The active intoxicant in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – this is fat soluble, is stored in the body’s fat reserves and transfers into breastmilk. The immediate effects on babies can be sedation, weakness and poor feeding pattern.[12]Because THC is stored and released slowly, among heavy, regular cannabis users the levels of THC in breastmilk can be eight times the levels in blood serum.A mother who is intoxicated by cannabis use will sleep more deeply – plus her baby will also face the raised SIDS risk factors relating to tobacco use. Therefore co-sleeping would be clearly contraindicated.Cannabis suppresses prolactin production, which may affect milk production. There is some evidence of this in animal studies, however human studies have found no difference in weaning age between cannabis using and non-cannabis using mothers.[13][14]If breastfeeding is well established, then prolactin suppression may not affect breastmilk production.Researchers are divided on whether the risks to the baby of cannabis exposure – including currently unidentified long-term developmental risks – are outweighed by the protective effects of breastmilk. Effects are dose-related, meaning that the risks to an infant of occasional exposure are very different to those who are regularly and chronically exposed.[15]ShishaShisha or waterpipe smoking involves flavoured tobacco being placed on a disk of charcoal which is then lit. The smoke is drawn through water and into the mouth. Sometimes tobacco free preparations are smoked via a waterpipe. The burning of charcoal produces a dense smoke containing a lot of carbon monoxide. Additionally, sessions are often long. These effects combined mean that in one shisha session you can absorb the equivalent amount of smoke as in 100 cigarettes.[16]Anyone wanting to decide whether their shisha smoking was affecting their baby via breastmilk would need to consider whether the exposure was one-off or long term. With occasional use, mothers would need to think about whether their co-sleeping risk was temporarily increased while they were affected by carbon monoxide.Written by Rebecca Coyle, edited by Ruth LewisOriginally published in LLLGB’s Leader publicationFEEDBACKCopyright LLLGB 2016Further readingSmoking and breastfeedinghttps://laleche.org.uk/smoking-breastfeeding/Marijuana and breastfeedinghttp://breastfeeding.support/smoking-weed-while-breastfeeding/[1]http://www.chinnstreetcounseling.com/zomerland/zomerland_11.shtml[2]http://www.ncsct.co.uk/usr/pub/Briefing%202.pdf[3]http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/15340/SPC/NiQuitin+21+mg+transdermal+patches[4]https://www.health-e-learning.com/resources/articles/40-social-drugs-and-breastfeeding[5]https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-an-evidence-update[6]http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2015/july/E-cigarettes-guidance-published/[7]http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/gender/en_tfi_gender_women_pregnancy_postpartum_smoking_cessation.pdf[8]http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/mitchell.pdf[9]http://www.nhs.uk/news/2012/06june/Pages/cannabis-lung-health-risks-underestimated.aspx[10]http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~HqAUxb:1[11]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809366/?tool=pubmed[12]http://www.health-e-learning.com/resources/articles/40-social-drugs-and-breastfeeding[13]http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~HqAUxb:1[14]http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~HqAUxb:1[15]http://www.health-e-learning.com/resources/articles/40-social-drugs-and-breastfeeding[16]https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/risk-factors/smoking/shisha"
Breastfeeding and Dental Health,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-dental-health/,"From the early days with your newborn, breastfeeding often becomes a very important and comfortable part of your relationship with your child. As well as continuing to provide important nutrients and protection against ill health, it’s a wonderful way to continue to connect with and comfort your growing infant, both during the day and quite often at night too.1In fact, night nursing is a biologically normal behaviour.2However, as time goes by and your baby’s teeth come in, a new concern may emerge. You may be told by your dentist that breastfeeding causes tooth decay and some dentists may advise early weaning from the breast, or at least no night-time nursing.In this article we look at questions and concerns about dental health and discuss how it can be protected while you and your baby continue to enjoy your important breastfeeding relationship.Is it true that breastfeeding will contribute to my child’s tooth decay?Does the research show I should wean after one to prevent tooth decay?How does diet affect dental health?How can I ensure good dental hygiene?What if my dentist tells me I should stop breastfeeding?Do studies show human milk may protect against bacteria?Are some children more susceptible to dental caries?What can I take from all this information?Is it true that breastfeeding will contribute to my child’s tooth decay?Studies show that a breastfed child is significantly less likely to suffer from tooth decay (dental caries) than a child who is formula fed. According to a report issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in January 2020, “Evidence suggests that infants who are breastfed in the first year of life have lower levels of dental caries than those fed infant formula.”3The report adds:“One systematic review suggested a higher risk of ECC [early childhood caries] when breastfeeding extends beyond one year of age, but the data analysis did not control adequately for important confounders such as intake of sugars from other sources.”4As well as the continuing significance to the health of mother and child, breastfeeding promotes optimal jaw and tooth development. A breastfed child is less likely to suffer from crooked teeth (malocclusion)5and the longer the child is breastfed the greater the reduction in risk. A breastfed baby may also be protected from developing dental fluorosis (discolouration of teeth).6Does the research show I should wean after one to prevent tooth decay?There is no convincing evidence to show that breastfeeding itself is causing problems or that stopping will prevent tooth decay. Studies often look at the effects of lactose (milk sugar, which is also present in breastmilk) on teeth, not the effects of breastmilk as a whole, with its antibacterial properties, helpful enzymes and high pH.Research about the impact of breastfeeding on dental health after the age of one acknowledges that it is difficult to adequately control other factors such as diet, dental hygiene, and the presence of bacteria in the mouth, when looking atearly childhood caries.In December 2018, Public Health England said that there are no good quality studies proving links between dental damage and breastfeeding beyond 12 months. Their guidance also emphasises the risks of not breastfeeding.7Other reports agree that research may not take into account diet alongside breastfeeding. A 2019 review entitled ‘Breastfeeding and early childhood caries. Review of the literature, recommendations, and prevention’ states that results from heterogeneous studies “do not always take into account contradictory factors such as eating habits of the mother or infant (feeding during the night, number of meals per day, eating sweet foods etc.), dental hygiene, or the sociocultural context.”8Another 2019 report entitled ‘Systematic Review of Evidence Pertaining to Factors That Modify Risk of Early Childhood Caries’9looked at breastfeeding and childhood caries in children aged up to 72 months. It concluded that breastfeeding for up to 24 months did not increase early childhood caries risk, although there was some “low-quality” evidence for increased risk in longer duration breastfeeding. The review added that some data indicated the impact of sugars in complementary foods increased risk.An older US study from 2007, ‘Association between infant breastfeeding and early childhood caries in the United States’,10assessed the potential risk factors for dental caries in 1,576 children aged 2-5 years old and demonstrated that there is no evidence to suggest that breastfeeding or its duration are risk factors for early childhood caries, severe early childhood caries, or decayed and filled surfaces on primary teeth.How does diet affect dental health?Current studies indicate that research cannot rule out our modern diet as a cause of dental problems rather than breastfeeding. Today’s diet includes many more cavity-inducing foods and it can be hard to get all those sugars off your child’s teeth.Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is an oral bacterium that’s especially hard on tooth enamel in the presence of sugar. Babies can pick up S. mutans from adults who carry the strain and who share food, utensils or mouth kisses with them; therefore it is important that the primary caregiver of a baby also maintains good oral health. Although your dentist may advise you to stop breastfeeding at night to prevent your baby or toddler from developing cavities, these factors are much more likely to play a role in your child’s dental health, making night weaning an irrelevant solution to the problem.11The importance of taking into account the overall diet of a breastfed infant is highlighted in a 2014 study from the University of California, ‘Association of long-duration breastfeeding and dental caries estimated with marginal structural models’, looking at possible links between longer-term breastfeeding and the risk of tooth decay and cavities.12Although the research found evidence of a greater risk of severe early tooth decay the more frequently a mother breastfed her child beyond the age of 24 months during the day, the author, Benjamin Chaffee, made positive comments about breastfeeding saying that the study does not suggest that breastfeeding causes caries and that the N. 1 priority for breastfeeding mothers should be ensuring their babies’ optimal nutrition.The authors speculated that it is possible that breastmilk in conjunction with excess refined sugar in modern foods may be contributing to the greater tooth decay seen in babies breastfed the longest and most often. This study also talks about “breastmilk bottles” as opposed to breastfeeds and highlights that nearly half the children had also been given infant formula by six months.A 2020 Australian study13also looked at diet and dental health in pre-schoolers by studying breastfeeding patterns and the intake of free sugars in their diet. The authors concluded that “Breastfeeding practices were not associated with early childhood caries. Given the wide-ranging benefits of breastfeeding, and the low prevalence of sustained breastfeeding in this study and Australia in general, recommendations to limit breastfeeding are unwarranted, and breastfeeding should be promoted in line with global and national recommendations. To reduce the prevalence of early childhood caries, improved efforts are needed to limit foods high in free sugars.”14How can I ensure good dental hygiene?The overwhelming conclusion when looking at breastfeeding and dental health is that, alongside diet, dental and oral hygiene is crucial in preventing cavities.The 2019 report entitled ‘Systematic Review of Evidence Pertaining to Factors That Modify Risk of Early Childhood Caries’15concluded that “Providing access to fluoridated water and educating caregivers are justified approaches to ECC prevention. Limiting sugars in bottles and complementary foods should be part of this education.”16Chaffee, the author of the 2014 study ‘Association of long-duration breastfeeding and dental caries estimated with marginal structural models’17said his team of researchers collected data on tooth brushing habits, but did not investigate a specific link between cleaning teeth after the last feeding and caries. He added that anything that removes carbohydrates and sugars from the oral cavity should help prevent tooth decay.An often-quoted 2015 study ‘Breastfeeding and the risk of dental caries: a systematic review and meta-analysis’ commented that “There was a lack of studies on children aged >12 months simultaneously assessing caries risk in breastfed, bottle-fed and children not bottle or breastfed.”18It also concluded that when infants were no longer exclusively breastfed or formula fed, confounding factors such as diet and tooth brushing practices needed to be taken into account. The authors stated that “further research with careful control of pertinent confounding factors is needed to elucidate this issue and better inform infant feeding guidelines.”19Public Health England’s recommendations are that parents or carers should brush their children’s teeth:as soon as they erupt;twice a day;last thing at night (or before bedtime) and on one other occasion;with a toothpaste containing at least 1000 ppm fluoride;using only a smear of toothpaste.There seems to be general agreement that the best way to aid your child’s dental health is to brush their teeth thoroughly at least twice a day with fluoridated toothpaste. It might also help to encourage your baby to swish with, or at least sip, water after eating solid foods. Some dentists recommend wiping a child’s teeth after each nursing, including during the night, but this can prove to be a difficult and unnecessary procedure.While there is no need to keep your child from nursing at night, it is important to brush teeth before going to sleep and not to offer any carbohydrates after that. This is in line with the findings of a 1999 study which investigated the effect of different solutions on dental health by immersing healthy, extracted teeth in them. The results showed that breastmilk alone was practically identical to water and did not cause tooth decay. However, when a small amount of sugar was added to the breastmilk, the mixture was worse than a sugar solution when it came to causing tooth decay.20You may also want to ask your dentist for information about using xylitol. This is a natural carbohydrate sugar substitute that interferes with bacteria’s ability to stick to the tooth surface. Aside from being available as a cooking ingredient, xylitol is often found in chewing gum and it’s possible that its use by mothers with high levels of S.Mutans may reduce the level of bacteria in their mouths, consequently lowering the risk of passing S.Mutans to their baby.21In summary, breastfeeding, when accompanied by toothbrushing and better nutrition by reducing the frequency and consumption of sugary foods, continues to contribute significantly to well-being for many mothers and infants. Regular consultation with a dentist for examination and preventive advice regarding dietary practices (especially sugar intake), oral hygiene, or supplementary fluoride is recommended.What if my dentist tells me I should stop breastfeeding?While dentists are naturally concerned about oral health, they may not have a lot of training on the overall significance of breastfeeding to the short- and long-term physical and mental health of both mother and child.According to the 2018 Public Health England guidance on Breastfeeding and dental health, “Breastfeeding is the physiological norm against which other behaviours are compared; therefore, dental teams should promote breastfeeding and include in their advice the risks of not breastfeeding to general and oral health.”22The guidance states that dentists and their teams should support evidence-based guidelines from the WHO and the UK government and in a core message to dental teams and healthcare professionals includes the following recommendations:“Dental teams should continue to support and encourage mothers to breastfeed.”“Not being breastfed is associated with an increased risk of infectious morbidity (for example gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, middle-ear infections).”“Breastfeeding up to 12 months of age is associated with a decreased risk of tooth decay.”If your dentist would like further advice, the UKHSA refers them to ‘Health Matters: Child Dental Health’ (2017)23and ‘Delivering Better Oral Health: An Evidence-Based Toolkit for Prevention’ (2014).24There are supportive dentists who understand the significance of breastfeeding so if you are under pressure to wean, try to find one who respects your choices.Do studies show human milk may protect against bacteria?The late Dr. Brian Palmer, DDS studied children’s skulls that were thousands of years old and he found almost no cavities. In his presentations, he referred to evidence from anthropologists and commented that “If breastmilk caused decay – evolution would have selected against it. It would be evolutionary suicide for breastmilk to cause decay.”25One reason for the lack of cavities identified by Dr. Palmer may be that the mechanics of breastfeeding make it unlikely for human milk to stay in the baby’s mouth for long. During breastfeeding, the nipple is drawn deep within the baby’s mouth, and milk is literally squirted into the back of it. The nursing child must swallow before he can go on to the next step of the suckling process. In contrast, baby bottles can drip milk, juice, or formula into the baby’s mouth even if he is not actively sucking. If the baby does not swallow, the liquid can pool in the front of the mouth around the teeth. The artificial nipple is very short, so the liquid in the bottle is likely to pass over teeth before being swallowed.Another reason is that bacteria which cause cavity formations are inhibited by several components of human milk including high pH levels. IgA and IgG have the potential to retard streptococcal growth, and S. mutans is highly susceptible to the bactericidal action of lactoferrin, an active component of human milk.26Human milk also actively strengthens teeth by depositing calcium and phosphorus on them.Dr. Palmer was of the opinion that dry mouth is another factor that can increase the incidence of early childhood caries. Saliva, which helps maintain normal pH, is not produced as much at night, especially among those who breathe through their mouths. An infant or toddler who nurses often at night continues to produce saliva, which may help combat dry mouth.Are some children more susceptible to dental caries?In a survey entitled ‘Prolonged, on-demand Breastfeeding and Dental Caries – An Investigation’,27Dr. Harry Torney found that four factors were significantly associated with the high caries group. The most significant relationship was with defective enamel while the other three factors related to events that had occurred while the child was in utero. One of these was maternal stress and/or bereavement as reported by the mother. Another was a reduced intake of dairy products as estimated retrospectively by the mother. The third factor was medically diagnosed illness in the mother. If a mother’s pre-natal diet and/or antibiotics received during pregnancy have affected the quality of a child’s tooth enamel and resistance to cavities, the permanent teeth are almost always fine. Diet and oral hygiene are also factors, as confirmed by the more recent research discussed above.Dr. Torney found no correlation between the onset of dental caries under two years of age and breastfeeding patterns such as feeding to sleep, frequent night feeds, etc. In his opinion, under normal circumstances, the antibodies in breastmilk counteract the mouth bacteria which cause tooth decay. However, in the presence of small enamel defects, the teeth become more vulnerable, and the protective effect of breastmilk is not sufficient to counteract bacteria combined with the sugars in the milk.According to this research, a baby who is exclusively breastfed (no supplemental bottles, juice, or solids) will not have decay unless he is genetically predisposed, i.e. soft or no enamel. In a baby who does have a genetic problem, weaning will not slow down the rate of decay and may speed it up due to lack of lactoferrin.28Dr. Palmer’s research is in line with this: “Human milk alone does not cause dental caries. Infants exclusively breastfed are not immune to decay due to other factors that impact the infant’s risk for tooth decay. Decay causing bacteria (streptococcus mutans) is transmitted to the infant by way of parents, caregivers, and others.29A couple of studies have also highlighted a possible association between early childhood caries and maternal Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy.3031What can I take from all this information?While you may initially feel concerned about the effects of longer-term and nighttime breastfeeding, it is important to look at all the factors contributing to the dental health of your breastfed child.Historically children who nursed all night had little or no decay until the advent of decay-inducing foods.Human milk alone rarely contributes to decay and actually has tooth-strengthening properties. While parents need to be aware of the dangers of sweet foods and drinks and of the benefits of strict oral hygiene and visits to the dentist, it’s important not to overlook the impact on physical and emotional health of breastfeeding for the baby, family and society as a whole.The WHO recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health and then continue breastfeeding for up to two years of age and beyond, alongside complementary foods.When using the evolution of other primates as a comparison point for humans, it is interesting to notice that in human babies breastfeeding would be expected to continue for at least two and a half years. Anthropologist Kathy Dettwyler states that while“it is meaningless, statistically, to speak of an average age of weaning world- wide”32anthropologists have found that children naturally wean between two and a half years and around seven years of age.Weaning from the breast before you and your baby are ready because of unsubstantiated fears of tooth decay would be denying both of you of the many positive outcomes from continued breastfeeding and may lead to the unnecessary introduction of bottles.The research discussed above shows that there is no need to night wean your child to take care of their dental health. Adopting a good oral hygiene regimen, using fluoridated toothpaste and consuming a low-sugar diet are likely to have a much more significant impact in terms of reducing the risk ofearly childhood caries.Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, July 2022Other online Information:https://breastfeeding.support/breastfeeding-and-tooth-decay/https://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/tooth-decay/https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/phe-statement-breastfeeding-and-dental-health/breast-feeding-and-tooth-decay-infographic/References:1.https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-beyond-a-year/2.https://laleche.org.uk/reasons-night-waking-biological-norm/3.World Health Organization.

When breastfeeding isn’t working,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-isnt-working-2/,"La Leche League GB is not a pressure group. Our wish is to offer parents accurate information so that they can make informed decisions that feel right for themselves and their child.Breastmilk is the optimal food for babies, as it is uniquely made up of the exact nutrients needed for each individual baby for at least the first six months.  New discoveries are still being made about the way various components of breastmilk work to aid the growth and development of babies.However there are times when, due to individual circumstances, mothers are unable to breastfeed or feel it is really not for them. Then what is important to a child is the love, care, warmth and bonding they experience.  LLL Leaders can provide a listening ear for parents to talk about their feelings and concerns, enabling them to discuss the situation with someone who will be completely non-judgmental. We don’t offer advice, as every mother/baby relationship is unique and what is right for one will not be right for another, butwe offer information to empower parents to make a decision that is right for them.If an LLL Leader has any concern about the health of a baby, we will suggest the mother contact a health professional. We also understand thatthere are occasions when offering supplementation, alongside breastfeeding support, is important for a baby’s health.LLL accredited Leaders have breastfed their own babies, but many of us first contacted LLL because of difficulties with feeding, or because we had previously stopped breastfeeding a baby before we wanted to. LLL Leaders know that when a mother needs a bit of help, it can’t wait until tomorrow. We offer mother to mother support viagroups,phone callsandemailsand have a range ofonline support options.While we do represent the views of breastfeeding families in any discussions on breastfeeding, both in the media and via government committees, as well as organisations such asNICE(National Institute for Clinical Excellence) and theBFLG(Baby Feeding Law Group), we will never try to persuade a mother to breastfeed.Breastfeeding provides babies with everything they need, but motherswho don’t breastfeed will find the way that suits them to nourish and cherish their child. The most important thing is that parents feel they have been able to make an informed choice and do what is right for them in their personal situation.Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGBFurther readingMy baby needs more milkNursing supplementersSharing BreastmilkWhen breastfeeding ends suddenlyRelactation & Induced Lactation"
Reasons why night waking is a biological norm,https://laleche.org.uk/reasons-night-waking-biological-norm/,"One of the questions new parents are often asked is “Is he sleeping through the night yet?” Because formula-fed babies are perceived as sleeping for longer, mothers with night-waking babies can feel pressured to offer formula to try to encourage longer periods of sleep.Social expectations are defining infant needsDr. James J. McKenna, Director of the Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame and member of La Leche League International’s Health Advisory Council,has stated in previous discussions about night waking that he wonders if parental expectations have been determined by social ideologies and social ‘wish lists’, which have little to do with who babies are biologically. By expecting babies to sleep through the night, parents are defining infant needs in terms of who we want them to become and notions as to how, for example, to make them ‘independent’ at young ages.Night waking is caused by a variety of reasonsDr. McKenna says that infant waking can be related to breathing patterns. Sleep apnoea (a temporary inability to breathe) can induce protective awakenings and infants who spend more time in deeper sleep do not arouse so easily in order to prevent a life-threatening apnoea. (i)Dr. Mckenna adds that it is known that babies that die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) likely had some kind of arousal deficiency (did not arouse sufficiently well enough). He states that externally induced arousals (sleeping near to mother) might also improve awakening skills; this is important “since infantile cardio-pulmonary perturbations are corrected by the infant arousing from sleep that leads to oxygenation. Arousing is an infant’s best defense against a range of potential physiological challenges”.(ii)McKenna speculates that perhaps mothers evolved to induce arousals (to have their babies feed) as, for several reasons, lots of arousals may increase an infant’s chance for survival. It may also help protect mothers from a variety of diseases, including breast and ovarian cancers.  Dr. McKenna says infants are not always waking for food, but also for non-nutritive purposes, such as to be cuddled and touched, and possibly reassured emotionally. Night waking is often determined and/or regulated “by way of changing growth, metabolic and developmental caloric requirements, and likely by the infant’s own personality characteristics” (iii)Feeling TiredFrequent night waking to breastfeed poses a significant challenge to mother’s sleep, but feeding a baby formula milk which over-rides its instinct to wake could create other problems.Night feeds are important as they help to establish and maintain your milksupply and help to avoid engorgement, blocked ducts and mastitis. Breastfeeding is sometimes blamed for a mother’s tiredness, but caring for a new baby is often tiring, independent of the way a baby is fed. It can help to try to sleep or rest when the baby does, even if it’s not a time when you would normally nap. Sitting down to breastfeed means you get a chance to relax and put your feet up.Studies have shown that when mothers stop breastfeeding their fatigue level does not change. One US study also found that breastfeeding mothers averaged 40-45 minutes more sleep at night during the first three months than those formula feeding, even when fathers helped out with giving bottles.(iv, v)Investing in breastfeeding supportWhile formula manufacturers can invest a lot of money into promoting their product and may suggest that it will help babies to sleep better, there are limited funds available to provide women with information and support about breastfeeding. Much of the support women receive comes from charities relying on voluntary breastfeeding supporters.According to the NHS 2010 Infant Feeding Survey (IFS), breastfeeding initiation rates in GB remain around 80%, but there is still a very rapid drop-off rate. The majority of women who stop breastfeeding in the early weeks would have liked to continue longer and lack of information and support with initial difficulties is a key problem. (vi)Given that the vast majority of women wish to breastfeed, there is a strong need for additional investment in breastfeeding support when women need it and a clearer understanding of the way breastmilk offers optimal growth and protection for babies.When making decisions about infant feeding, it can help to know that it is normal for a baby to wake at night and how lots of arousals can in fact protect the baby. Understanding that “sleeping through the night” is something which will happen when the baby is developmentally ready allows women to make an informed decision without feeling pressured into introducing formula.Written by Anna Burbidge on behalf of La Leche League GB, July 2016Further readingi.

Breastfeeding in Emergency Situations,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-emergency-situations/,"Breastfeeding in emergency situations is usually talked about in relation to disasters which have occurred in countries outside of the UK.  However unexpected crises can happen anywhere at any time.In emergency situations breastfeeding provides a mother with the ability to nourish her child whatever circumstances they are in. Human milk contains all the nutrients a baby needs, along with antibodies to help fight infection and disease. Hormones contained in breastmilk can help to lower stress levels in both mother and baby, and breastfeeding provides warmth and comfort.Support for continuing breastfeedingIn an emergency a priority would be to get as many babies as possible being breastfed by their own mothers. Mothers who are breastfeeding need reassurance that even if they are hungry and stressed they can still breastfeed and can offer the breast as much as the baby wants.  If a baby is ill breastmilk is quickly absorbed and helps fight sickness1. If a mother is ill antibodies in her milk will help protect her baby2.It is sometimes not realised that mothers who have not been breastfeeding can be encouraged to put the baby to the breast to initiate re-lactation. It can take a little time and effort but with the right support breastmilk can be produced again. A baby might be wrapped in a sling or blanket to give skin-to-skin contact and a little privacy while the mother tries this.  Although the amount will be limited at first frequent nursing will build up the supply. Find more information about relactation and induced lactationhere.Formula feeding in an emergency is difficultA good way of supporting breastfeeding mothers in any emergency situation is to keep them supplied with adequate food, water and ways to keep warm, along with baby clothes and nappies. Routine distribution of infant formula should be avoided. Formula feeding in an emergency is difficult, does not offer protection against illness and can be dangerous if it is not possible to prepare properly. Powdered formulas are not sterile and should only be used where water can be sterilised by boiling, and human milk is not an option. Local water supplies may have been compromised and bottled water should be used with care as some varieties have too high a level of minerals for babies. Bottles and teats are very difficult to adequately clean and feeding cups may be a better alternative.Breastfeeding in a traumatic situationDuring unexpected emergencies such as floods families may find they face power cuts, water shortages and even sudden evacuation from the comforts of their home. A breastfeeding mother needs no equipment to feed her baby and more importantly she has the knowledge that food for her baby will be readily available whenever needed and wherever she is, and will actively protect her baby while they are in a very traumatic situation.Where to find further informationFind support with breastfeedinghere.List of resources in different languageshttps://llli.org/breastfeeding-info/infant-feeding-emergencies-multilingual/1https://laleche.org.uk/amazing-milk/2https://laleche.org.uk/when-a-mother-is-ill/"
