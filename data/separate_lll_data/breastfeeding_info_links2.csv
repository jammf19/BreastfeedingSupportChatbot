Exclusively Expressing Breastmilk for Your Baby,https://laleche.org.uk/exclusively-expressing-breastmilk-for-your-baby/,"When babies cannot feed at the breast comfortably and effectively, and breastfeeding support is hard to find or not able to help, mothers may choose to use a breast pump to express all the milk their baby needs, and then feed via a bottle or feeding tube. This is known as exclusive pumping. While this is often a temporary solution to protect milk supply until the baby is able to nurse directly at the breast, some mothers may find themselves exclusively pumping long term. Some mothers may also actively choose to exclusively pump and some mothers may be unable to feed their baby directly at the breast because their baby is poorly or has medical difficulties.The decision to exclusively express breastmilk usually stems from an awareness of the irreplaceable qualities of breastmilk. Mothers also find that providing their babies with breastmilk can help with the grief from not being able to nurse directly at the breast. If their baby has medical difficulties, many mothers feel strongly that providing human milk will give their child the best possible start, particularly if their baby is in hospital. Yet, exclusive pumping is a significant undertaking which requires dedication, information and support.You might find the decision to exclusively express feels difficult, and that you don’t feel you fit with breastfeeding mothers or with those using formula. Please be sure that you will receive a warm welcome and support at LLL meetings and from your local Leader, and that we understand the lengths you’re going to, to make sure your baby has your milk.This page concentrates on the practicalities of how and when to express your milk and feed it to your baby, to establish exclusive expressing as your feeding method. Sometimes it can help to focus on all these practicalities and, once you have a workable plan, to give yourself time too to process how you’re feeling about it, as you settle into life with your new baby. If you have a partner or supporter at home with you, all the things that are useful insupporting a breastfeeding motherwill apply to you too!Getting StartedEquipmentSetting your scheduleHow long is an expressing session?The importance of OxytocinHow to pumpHow much milk to pumpFeeding your breastmilkStoring your breastmilkStopping exclusively pumpingGetting StartedIf you have recently given birth and your mature milk has not yet come in, hand expressing is the most effective way of collecting colostrum to feed to your baby. It is important to start expressing colostrum within six hours (ideally after one hour, if possible) of giving birth, though if this doesn’t happen for you, it is still possible to get started.A newborn would expect to feed 8-12 times in 24 hours, and the feeds might not be evenly spread over that time, though they do need to include some feeds in the night; it is important to try to express breastmilk just as frequently in order to lay the groundwork for a robust milk supply later on. If you can have skin to skin contact with your baby while you’re expressing, it can really help, and a photo or something that smells of your baby can be a substitute. You can collect your colostrum in a syringe, a small clean cup or a spoon. See our article onHand Expression of Breastmilkfor more information on hand expressing, and you might also findthis videoon hands-on pumping helpful. This technique can be tricky to get the hang of, so please do ask your midwife or other breastfeeding supporter to help. It’s very common to need an extra pair of hands to collect the drops of colostrum.EquipmentAs your milk starts to transition, you will probably notice it start to change colour and spray out as you are expressing; this is a good time to introduce a breast pump. Although some women respond better to hand expressing, using a hospital grade double electric pump is the most effective way of removing breastmilk when a baby isn’t latching or is not nursing adequately. If you are planning on exclusively expressing for your baby long term, then it will be worth investing in a hospital grade double pump. If you would like to try one before deciding whether or not to buy it, your hospital or midwife may be able to provide you with one on a short-term loan. Alternatively, you can hire a pump, although it may turn out to be rather expensive if you are exclusively expressing long term.A breast pump usually comes with a collection set and the part that sits over your nipple/areola, which is called a flange. As women’s nipples and skin elasticity differ, flanges are available in different sizes. It’s important to ensure you have the right size for your nipples, as flanges that are too large or too small may cause pain or nipple damage and reduce the amount of milk you are able to express. Finding the right flange size may be a bit of a trial and error process; you may want to start by trying the standard size that comes with the pump (which varies for different pump brands) and see how you respond. If the standard flange sucks in too much areola, or if your nipple is at the back of the pump, you may need to go down a size. If, instead, you are left with a white ring around your nipple, you may need to go up a size.Many mums find being able to express handsfree invaluable in terms of allowing them to fit regular pumping sessions into their day. There are a small variety of pumps that provide milk collection cups that sit inside your bra, freeing you up to cuddle your baby without fear of spilling your milk. However, they tend to have a limited range of flange sizes. Alternatively, you can buy special bras designed to hold your pump flanges against your breasts, or you can even DIY your own by cutting holes in a stretchy bra that line up with your nipples.There are several other things to consider when choosing which hospital grade double pump to purchase or hire:– How often will you use it?If you are planning to exclusively pump long term, you may need to consider motor life, to make sure the pump you purchase will live up to its use.– How portable is it?If it uses a battery, then it can be carried around the house or out and about with you. Some pumps have built-in rechargeable batteries, while others offer the option to purchase a power pack or a car charger. Some pumps use removable batteries which are easy to replace if you unexpectedly run out of charge while away from a plug socket. However, using removable batteries may end up being rather expensive long term. You might find you end up using two different pumps – an efficient hospital grade one when you’re at home and a hand pump or battery pump when you’re out and about.– Can you purchase spare collection sets?Having a spare collection set or two can come in handy, as most mothers find that it is easier to stick to their pumping schedule if their pump is set up and ready to go at a moment’s notice, especially at nighttime.Setting your scheduleFor the first three-four months, you will need to express regularly to build a robust milk supply, ideally 8-12 times in 24 hours. Although you do not always need to pump at regular intervals, it is best not to go more than two to three hours between pumping sessions, with one longer stretch of four-five hours at night if you can take this break without damaging your milk supply. You will need to have at least one pumping session overnight, ideally between 2am and 5am when prolactin levels are highest. If you are able to pump when your baby wakes up for a feed, you may find it easier to do so than setting an alarm. If you need to set an alarm, but are having difficulty waking up, it may be worth experimenting with setting it for different times to try and coincide with the periods in your sleep cycle where you are in a lighter sleep. Many mothers find that they are able to express the most milk first thing in the morning, and less as the day goes on. You will notice your own patterns. It’s also common for one breast to produce more milk or have a faster flow than the other side.Working out ways to fit pumping sessions into your routine is key to long-term success. Some mothers will express while cooking, or holding a sleeping baby, or while travelling; sometimes before they feed their baby, sometimes afterwards. Experiment to find out what works best for your family and your daily rhythms.In the early days, you may find that you are producing more milk than your baby needs; this is common and it will settle down in a few weeks. It can be useful to freeze any excess milk in small portions for later on, should your baby suddenly require more milk, such as during a growth spurt or period of illness.Once your supply has established, usually between three and four months, you may decide to slowly reduce your number of daily pumping sessions. If you are planning to exclusively express long term, however, you may decide not to make any changes to your pumping schedule. If you start to reduce your expressing sessions, you may like to keep a record of your daily pumping outputs so that you can monitor what effect it has on your overall milk supply. You could start by increasing the intervals between your overnight pumping sessions, although it will still be important to express once at night. After doing this for about three-four weeks, you may consider dropping one daytime session. This may require you to adjust the time of all your other pumping sessions, in order to avoid leaving a big gap in between them, which could make you vulnerable to experiencing blocked ducts or mastitis.Once your baby starts eating solids reliably, around eight-nine months, you may start to notice a change in their milk requirements and can adjust your pumping schedule and milk supply accordingly. However, many mothers find that introducing solids does not affect milk intake for a lot longer (in some cases, 18 months). When your baby is sat in a highchair, it can be a good time to express your milk without them pulling on the pump tubes.How long is an expressing session?The length of each expressing session will vary for each mother, based on her breast storage capacity and the type of pump she uses. If you are able to express milk from both breasts at once, then you will find it much faster.While some experts recommend pumping for about 15-20 minutes, others believe that specifying the duration of a pumping session may not be helpful, as some mothers may take up to 45 minutes. In her book Exclusively Pumping Breastmilk,iStephanie Casemore suggests spending two hours over the course of 24 hours expressing. However, this total pumping time may need to be adjusted for mothers who need long individual expressing sessions. Also, other experts believe the total number of separate sessions to be more important than total pumping duration, with shorter, more frequent expressing sessions usually being more effective than fewer, longer sessions.As a general rule of thumb, you can express until your milk stops spraying, and then for an additional five minutes to stimulate another let-down. If you need to increase your supply, you can pump for 10 more minutes and use hand expression right after to remove as much milk as possible. Breast compressions and massage during sessions (hands-on pumping) also help to stimulate let-downs and maximise milk output. Some mothers find that it helps to experiment with “power pumping”, where they pump frequently for short periods, to mimic cluster feeding. This might be something to use on occasion rather than as part of a daily routine as it can be quite time-intensive.If, on the other hand, you need to decrease your supply, then slowly reduce the length of time you are expressing for. In both cases, many of the techniques discussed in our articles “My baby needs more milk” and “Too Much Milk and Oversupply” can be adapted for use with a breast pump.If you are worried that you do not have enough time to do a full session, then it is better to pump less time and have a longer session later, than to miss one entirely.Over time, as you reduce the number of pumping sessions, you may find that you will need to express for longer to obtain the same amount of milk. Many women find that if they cycle through their pump settings again, they can trigger a second or even a third let-down over a period of 30-45 minutes.The importance of OxytocinOxytocin is the hormone that triggers your letdown (milk ejection reflex). It is especially important to be mindful of this when expressing, as even mildly stressful situations of feeling rushed can make it difficult to trigger a letdown when using a breast pump. Many mothers find looking at their baby – or at pictures of their baby if they are separated – while expressing helpful. Gently massaging your breasts before and during your pumping session, as well as applying warm compresses or taking a warm shower before expressing can also trigger a let-down. Other ways to boost your oxytocin might include listening to music, watching a comedy on TV, reading a book, or browsing social media on your phone.If you are able to cuddle your baby while expressing, you may see an increase in your normal milk output! It is even possible to express while carrying your baby in a sling or baby carrier. As your baby gets older and more mobile, you may find it easier to remove yourself to a different room where you can relax without worrying about them pulling on your tubes, or getting into things they shouldn’t.It can feel disheartening if you are watching your collection bottles and feel that they are not filling up quickly enough. Covering the bottles with socks, or distracting yourself so that you are not watching, can be helpful. If you are struggling to get a let-down, it is ok to put your pump away and come back to it 10-20 minutes later and try again. If it is a persistent problem at certain times of day, try to remember that the stimulation you are giving your breast still has a valuable purpose.How to pumpIn order to keep pumping comfortable and avoid nipple damage, you may want to consider using lubrication, such as lanolin or olive oil, inside the pump flange to reduce friction. The flange needs to make a comfortable seal around the breast.Pumps have different suction and cycles settings. You may want to start with a low suction and high number of cycles to stimulate your let-down. Once your milk starts flowing, you can decrease the number of cycles and increase suction. In order to avoid getting sore, it is a good idea not to use the same suction setting for long periods of time. Switching between low and high suction also helps to trigger more let-downs.Once you are done pumping, you can massage both breasts and hand express to make sure your breasts are completely drained.How much milk to pumpAs breastmilk is highly digestible, breastfed babies tend to feed little and often. When babies nurse directly at the breast, milk intake varies from feeding to feeding, so the amount of breastmilk taken per bottle may also vary throughout the day. On average, babies need 750-1035ml of breastmilk per day between one and six months of age. You may want to pump slightly more than this to make sure you have enough milk when your baby goes through a grow spurt.Feeding your breastmilkBabies drink from a bottle and nurse from the breast in a completely different way. When drinking from a bottle, babies cannot control the flow of milk, which can be uncomfortable for them and can lead to overfeeding. In order to minimise this problem, you may want to feed your baby your expressed milk in a way that is as close as possible to nursing. This is often referred to as paced bottle feeding.Rather than feeding your baby bottles of expressed milk according to a strict schedule, you may want to feed on demand, as you would if they were nursing at the breast, being aware of early hunger cues. Holding your baby upright and keeping the bottle in a horizontal position allows the baby to suck actively, as he would at the breast, and to control the flow of milk, taking a break whenever he needs to. Offering the bottle teat gently, letting the baby draw it into their mouth, and feeding to satiation also allow the baby to be more in control of his feed. You can find more information on how to feed your baby your expressed milk in our article ‘Bottles and other tools‘.It’s important to remember that breastmilk should not be warmed up in a microwave or in a pan on the hob, in order to avoid damaging its nutrients. Shaking breastmilk is also not necessary.Storing your breastmilkBreastmilk’s antibacterial properties help it stay fresh, so it can be safely stored at room temperature for four-six hours and in the fridge for up to a week. If away from home, you could use a cool bag with ice packs. Our pageStoring Your Milkhas comprehensive details on safe periods for storing expressed milk for healthy babies. If your baby is unwell or premature, then follow hospital guidelines. Your baby will benefit more from fresh than frozen breastmilk because its living properties will help him fight off possible infections, however all human milk is beneficial for you baby.You may well see that your expressed milk is not always the same colour, and that it separates into layers when it has been stored for a while. Neither of these is a cause for concern, and a gentle swirl of the container before you feed your milk to your baby should make the layers mix again.If you find that you are producing more milk than your baby needs, you might like to consider donating your milk by registering as a donor for your local breastmilk bank.Stopping exclusively pumpingWhen you feel ready to stop expressing milk for your baby, it’s important not to rush into dropping pumping sessions, in order to avoid the risk of experiencing blocked ducts or mastitis. Your breasts need time to adjust, so it’s best to adopt a gradual approach. You could try to reduce the length of your pumping sessions by a few minutes over a few weeks, or you could try slowly increasing the intervals between sessions.Exclusive pumping, while also doing the day to day work of looking after your baby, can be exhausting, and sometimes mothers and parents wrestle with feeling guilty about having stopped “too soon”. By taking on the work of exclusive pumping, though, you gave your baby a wonderful gift.Written by Nicola Sheldon (LLL Berkshire and Oxfordshire) and Eva Williams (LLL Oxfordshire), May 2020.Thanks to Harriet Valentino for her input and to Lois Rowlands, Rae Vacher Lowe and Laura Loasby for the photos.Further readinghttps://laleche.org.uk/hand-expression-of-breastmilk/https://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-needs-more-milk/https://laleche.org.uk/too-much-milk-and-oversupply/https://laleche.org.uk/bottles-and-other-tools/https://laleche.org.uk/expressing-your-milk/#Pumpshttps://laleche.org.uk/storing-your-milk/A mother’s story from our members magazine breastfeeding mattershttps://kellymom.com/category/bf/pumpingmoms/pumping/Exclusively Pumping Breastmilk, Second edition.

Getting breastfeeding on track after a difficult start – the “3 Keeps”,https://laleche.org.uk/getting-breastfeeding-on-track-after-a-difficult-start-the-3-keeps/,"When you have early breastfeeding problems, it can feel as if it’s “all gone wrong” and the dreams you had about feeding your baby are in ruins.  Fortunately, babies are very adaptable and resilient, and so are their mothers!  With time, patience and, if necessary, skilled help, it is almost always possible to get feeding back on track after a difficult start.  It is always possible to have a close, warm, happy feeding relationship with your baby – even if it might look different from what you had expected.  It is important to act quickly, as soon as there are signs that things aren’t going well,  but even if more time has passed, things can still get better.Some examples of early difficulties:You had a more complicated birth. Babies born with the aid of forceps, for example, often take a few days to recover and feed well.  If you needed a lot of pain relief in labour, your baby may be sleepy at first.Your baby was born early, or small for their gestational age. See alsobreastfeeding premature babiesandlate preterm babies(those born between 34 and 37 weeks).You and your baby were separated after birth because one or both of you needed medical care.Your baby is very sleepy and doesn’t have enough energy to breastfeed. See alsosleepy babyandnewborn jaundice.Your baby gets frustrated or upset when they try to breastfeed. See alsomy baby won’t breastfeedandthe unhappy breastfed baby.Breastfeeding is very painful for you. See alsonipple pain.Your baby has a physical challenge such astongue-tie.Your baby is growing more slowly than expected. See alsomy baby needs more milk.Your milk production is lower than you would like it to be. SeeHow to increase your milk supplyandHow milk production works.You have plenty of timeParents sometimes worry that if their baby isn’t breastfeeding well, or at all, in the first few hours, days or weeks after birth, it will never happen.  While breastfeeding in the first hour after birth is ideal, the window of opportunity for babies to start breastfeeding, and to get better at it, is much longer than this.  The early feeding reflexes, which keep babies seeking and attaching to the breast, last for at least two to three months.  Where there is milk, there is always the possibility of breastfeeding.First things firstSorting out breastfeeding problems can feel overwhelming.  There seems to be so much to do, and you might feel you have to do it all at the same time!  It is helpful to know what is urgent and what is less urgent.  This can help you to work out what to do in what order, and how best to use your time and energy.Priorities – the “3 Keeps”If it’s taking time for breastfeeding to get going:Keep your milk flowingKeep your baby fedKeep your baby closeThis useful summary can be downloaded as a free A4 posterhere.Keep your milk flowingUnderstanding how milk production worksIt is possible to restart your milk production after stopping breastfeeding.  It is even possible to start milk production if you have never been pregnant![i]But it is usually much easier to get your milk supply going if you have just given birth – your body expects to make milk at this time.It is easiest to increase milk production in the first month or so after birth, when your breasts are most receptive.  After this, it usually becomes more difficult, because your body is not expecting to make more milk.  Even so, some women are able to get a big increase in their milk production later than this.  It’s always worth giving it a go, if you want to!Milk production usually increases quickly in the early days after birth and reaches almost peak production by about 10 days.  By about a month after birth, most women are making as much milk as their babies will ever need.  Babies need about the same amount of milk each day from one to six months of age  (from about six months, as they start eating other foods, the amount of milk that they need starts to reduce).When your baby is born, even if they are born early, you are already making milk. After birth, milk will only keep on being made if milk is being removed from your breasts.  If no milk is removed, your milk will dry up within about two weeks.  Your breasts will adjust to make the amount of milk that is being removed from them.If your baby is feeding well and taking as much milk as they need to feel satisfied and grow well, you will continue to make plenty of milk for your baby – or two or more babies, if you have more than one!Whenever a baby is not feeding well enough to take as much milk as they need, or is not feeding at the breast at all yet, the risk is that your breasts will adjust to making less milk than your baby needs.  This is why, if your goal is to breastfeed your baby exclusively (only on your milk) when they are ready,it is vital to make sure that you remove enough milk from your breasts in the early days and weeks after birth.You are removing enough milk if your baby is growing normally and producingwet and dirty nappies as expected, without needing anything other than your milk.For more information about how milk production works, see our articleHow milk production works.Why breastfeeding might be difficult at firstThe most common reason for a baby not to feed well is that they arenot quite getting a deep enough mouthful of breast.  When this happens, breastfeeding might hurt, the skin on your nipples may become damaged and/or your nipples might look pointy, like a new lipstick, when your baby comes off the breast.  Skilled face to face breastfeeding support usually helps most in this situation.Another common reason for babies not to feed well is thatthey don’t yet have enough energy.  They may be keen to breastfeed, and feed well for a short time, but they get tired before they get as much milk as they need.  This group may include babies who were born early, had a more difficult birth, are small, unwell, jaundiced, tongue-tied, etc.  They need more time and support (and medical treatment if necessary) until they are ready to breastfeed fully.Some mothers may need extra support with getting feeding started and a small number of mothers are not able to make all the milk their babies need. Reasons for this include:A history of infertility due to hormonal imbalances.Past breast surgery, especially breast reduction.Breast hypoplasia/Insufficient Glandular Tissue (IGT). Breasts may be unusually small, unevenly sized, long and thin, with a wide space between them.  There may be no breast changes, such as increase in size and tenderness, during pregnancy and after birth.Very large blood loss after birth – enough to make you very unwell.PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome).Thyroid problems (over- or under-active).You may have read that being overweight or obese (having a higher BMI, especially over 30) can lead to breastfeeding problems. It is not clear whether having a higher BMI, by itself, is a problem for breastfeeding and many women with high BMI breastfeed easily. We do know that some conditions associated with higher BMI, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, may delay your milk “coming in” (increasing in volume) in the early days after birth. This can make breastfeeding more challenging.If you have any of the risk factors above, it is important to have skilled help with breastfeeding so that you can get off to the best possible start. You can find more information in other articles on our website on:How milk production worksIncreasing your milk supplyIf you have done all you can to:Help your baby attach deeply to the breastMake sure your baby feeds at least 8-12 times in 24 hoursKeep your baby active at the breast by using compressions and switching sides when your baby stops actively feeding (you can find out how to do both of thesehere)but your baby still isn’t growing as expected, or there are other reasons to think that your baby is not getting all the milk they need, then it is important to start expressing your milk quickly.Your baby also needs to be checked by a doctor.Most babies who grow slowly are well, but occasionally slow growth can be a first sign of underlying illness, so it’s important to rule this out.Turning feeding around – changing directionWhen a baby is breastfeeding but is not feeding efficiently yet and is growing slowly, it is tempting to spend more and more time trying to breastfeed your baby.  This can end up being a negative cycle:because not enough milk is being removed, milk production decreases;because milk production is decreasing, the milk is harder for the baby to remove;because the baby is getting less milk than they need, their energy decreases;because they are feeding with less energy, breastfeeding becomes less effective and less milk is removed.Expressing your milk creates a positive cycle:because more milk is being removed, your breasts make more milk;because milk production is increasing, the milk is easier for your baby to remove;because your baby is getting more milk, their energy increases;because your baby is feeding with more energy, breastfeeding becomes more effective and more milk is removed.Active breastfeedingIf your baby is spending a lot of time breastfeeding but is not growing as expected, you may need to limit their time at the breast, to give you enough time to express.  Breastfeed while your baby is actively feeding, with deep sucks and swallowing after every one-two sucks. When your baby is only swallowing after every three sucks, or more, they are no longer actively feeding, and it would be more efficient to end the feed and express milk instead. A baby who breastfeeds “all the time” is probably asleep and not feeding actively for much of this time (light, fluttery sucks, very little swallowing).Expressing milkThis protects milk production by removing more milk from your breasts than your baby is able to take on their own.  If your goal is for your baby only to have your milk, your aim will be to express enough milk so that your baby can grow as expected and seem satisfied just on your milk.How often to expressIf your baby is able to get almost enough milk at the breast, you might only need to express once or twice a day.  If next time your baby is weighed, they are still growing slowly, increase the number of expressions.If there is a big gap between the amount of milk your baby is able to get at the breast and the amount your baby needs, you will need to express more often, if your goal is for your baby to be fed only or mostly on your milk.  If your baby is not breastfeeding at all, you would need to express at least 8-12 times in 24 hours, which is how many times most babies need to breastfeed.You don’t need to express regularly (most babies don’t feed regularly), just whenever you can.  The important thing is how many times you express in 24 hours – it’s up to you when you do it.  Experiment to see what works best. It’s fine to take a break for a few hours to go out or to sleep!  More, shorter expressions often work better than fewer, longer ones and it’s fine to stop in the middle of expressing, if you need to do something else. You might find that you get a new flow of milk when you start again.  Even if you only have a few minutes, it’s worth expressing.How to expressFor most women, the best tool for doing a lot of expressing (more than once or twice a day) is a double electric breast pump. Manual and single pumps are very small tools for this very big job, though some people find that they can express plenty with a small pump, or just using their hands.  You can find more information about how to express milkhere.Expressing longer-termMothers who need to express milk beyond the early weeks may find that they can reduce the number of times they express, while still getting the same amount of milk. You can read more about this (sometimes called the “magic number”)hereand find out why it varies so much between womenhere.  Some mothers can get all the milk they need just by expressing two or three times in 24 hours!  Some mothers feed their babies exclusively on expressed milk.  You can read more about this in the book “Exclusively Pumping Breastmilk”.For more information about how to increase your milk supply, our articleHow to increase your milk supplymay be of help.Keep your baby fedBabies always feed as well as they can – they are never “lazy” or uncooperative!  If feeding is not going well yet, it is because it is difficult for your baby at the moment.  They need extra support with feeding until they are able to do all the work by themselves.If your baby is able to do almost all the work of feeding,breast compression and switching sides when they are no longer actively feedingmay be enough to help them get all the milk they need at the breast.If your baby is unable to get all the milk they need at the breast even with some help, they will need extra milk, for the time being.How much milk do babies need?In the first 24 hours of life babies need an average of about 7ml (1 ½ teaspoons) of milk per feed. This roughly doubles every day for the first few days. If you are expressing your milk, for example because your baby was born early, it helps to know how much to aim for:500ml of milk in 24 hours by 10 days old;750ml of milk in 24 hours by two-three weeks old.Some babies need more or less milk than this – these are average amounts.  Some babies need as much as 1300ml of milk in 24 hours.If your baby was born early, they might need much less milk than this at the moment, but this gives you an idea of how much milk they are likely to need when they reach term age and size. It is important to aim for these amounts in the early weeks (if your goal is to feed your baby only on your milk) because it becomes more difficult to increase milk production later on. It is helpful to keep a record of how much you are expressing, so you can see how things are changing over time. If you are not expressing anything like these amounts yet, it is important to find a skilled feeding supporter quickly.What kind of milk?The first choice of extra milk is always a mother’s own expressed milk, which is tailor-made for her baby. The second choice is donated milk from another mother. The safest way to get donated milk is from a registered Milk Bank.[ii]When these are not available in the amounts needed, infant formula milk may be necessary.Formula milkWhen you were looking forward to breastfeeding your baby, it can feel disappointing to realise that they need formula milk as well. You might even wonder whether it is worth carrying on breastfeeding, or whether your baby will come to prefer formula milk. It can help to think of formula milk as a kind of medication, to give your baby the energy they need to breastfeed well.  You can read here abouthow to use formula milk strategically to support breastfeeding.  It is often possible to reduce the amount of formula milk that your baby needs, as they get better at breastfeeding and your milk supply increases.  If you need to use formula milk during the whole time your baby is fed only with milk, you may be able to reduce it after your baby starts eating other foods as well, from about six months.How to feed extra milk to your babyThere are many options for feeding your baby extra milk.  You can find information about choosing and using bottles, cups and morehereand about nursing supplementers (a tool that enables you to feed extra milk at the breast while your baby breastfeeds)here.  Your feeding supporter can help you decide which options might work for your baby.Keep your baby closeBreastfeeding provides more than just milk – it gives you and your baby lots of time to touch, gaze at and enjoy being with each other.  These, much more than the milk itself, are what builds strong connections between breastfeeding mothers and their babies.  Mothers (and dads, co-parents and other key adults) are able to build strong relationships with their babies when they are feeding in other ways, too.Skin to skin contactis an amazing way for your baby to connect with the important people in their life.  Babies held skin to skin are calmer, more relaxed, warmer, cry less and have more stable heart rates and breathing than babies who are wrapped up.  They are also protected against infection by being exposed to the “good bacteria” on your skin.  And it feels lovely!  You can read more about the magic of holding your baby skin to skinhere.“Wearing” your babyin a sling or carrier is a great way to keep your baby close while you get on with other things.  Being carried gives your baby many benefits, including more to look at, physical exercise, and less crying. You can read more about carrying your babyhere.When breastfeeding is stressfulWhen breastfeeding is difficult for your baby it may become stressful for both of you. Babies who have had stressful experiences at the breast can develop negative associations with breastfeeding. This might happen, for example:When a baby is in pain or discomfort after birth.When a more sensitive baby is handled in a way they don’t like.When milk supply is low, or a baby has a physical restriction that makes attaching and sucking difficult.A baby who is finding feeding hard may become upset:A short time into the feed, when milk flow slows down.At the start of the feed, when milk doesn’t come straight away.When offered the breast.When put in a breastfeeding position.When they see the breast.When feeding isn’t going well, babies may come to associate the breast with feeling hungry and frustrated. They may develop apreference for another feeding method, such as a bottle, if they associate it with feeling full and satisfied.If you and your baby are in this situation, you might need a “breastfeeding break”.  You could stop trying for a few days, while expressing your milk to keep your baby fed and protect your milk supply.  When you’re both ready, you can try again.Happy time at the breastHowever hard feeding has been, your baby can still discover that the breast is a great place to be, where they feel calm, relaxed and satisfied.  Here are some things you could try:If your baby has been refusing to feed, then try offering the breast when they are calm rather than when they are already hungry or upset.If your baby is having extra milk, give some or most of their feed by cup, bottle, etc. before letting your baby finish the feed on the breast.Laid-back breastfeeding.Allowing your baby to find their own breastfeeding position and to attach themselves can work especially well for babies who have had stressful experiences of being “put” to the breast.If you are giving extra milk, try giving it with yourbaby’s cheek resting against your bare breast.Consider using anursing supplementerso your baby can have extra milk while they breastfeed. This can be helpful when milk supply is low.“Breast-sleeping”.Let your baby end a feed by sleeping with their cheek pillowed on the breast.  Babies who are having all their milk by cup, bottle, etc. can enjoy doing this too.Take a bath with your baby. Low lighting and relaxing music can help set the scene!  Some babies will find their own way to the breast, and even if they don’t latch and feed, the bath can be a good place to learn to feel comfortable near the breast.Consider sleeping with your baby. Some babies will attach and feed in their sleep, if the breast is near enough to smell and feel when they stir in the night.Always considersleep safetybefore sleeping with your baby in your bed.   It is never safe to sleep with a baby on a sofa.Babies are hardwired to breastfeedBreastfeeding is an essential survival behaviour and all healthy babies will continue to try for many weeks after birth.  As long as your milk supply is protected, and your baby is fed, you and your baby have plenty of time to learn to breastfeed.  You can find a feeding relationship that works for you both – even if it isn’t quite what you imagined before your baby arrived.  ‘Successful breastfeeding’ can look like many different things for different families.Getting skilled support can help, as can hearing from other mothers who had a difficult start with breastfeeding and have found their way through it. La Leche League groups welcome anyone who is breastfeeding or providing their own milk for a baby or trying to do so. Please don’t feel awkward about needing to give your baby extra milk, in any way you need to, at an LLL meeting! We would love to meet you and your baby.

Breastfeeding and a Mother’s Diet: Myths and Facts,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-and-a-mothers-diet-myths-and-facts/,"Women hear a lot of conflicting information about what they can or cannot eat while breastfeeding and these recommendations may vary according to culture and tradition, along with individual personal preference and finances. In some cultures a food may be considered beneficial to a breastfeeding mother, but in another culture mothers may be cautioned against the exact same food.  For instance, spicy food is considered bad for babies in some societies, but in others spices form a big part of everyday cuisine.Here are some myths and facts about a woman’s diet and breastfeeding.Composition of BreastmilkMyth: Breastmilk is made directly from what an individual eatsBreastmilk is made in the breasts, directly from a mother’s blood. It is not made directly from the food she eats.When food, drink or medication are ingested, the substance is broken down by the digestive tract and molecule-sized components of the substance are absorbed into the blood. When these molecules get to the capillaries near the breast tissue, they move through the cells that line the alveoli and into the milk. This process is known as diffusion.Diffusion explains how drugs and other foreign substances enter milk. Many factors influence whether or in what quantity a substance will actually enter the milk.The process of diffusion allows good things, such as antibodies, to easily enter colostrum and mature milk. This means that breastmilk changes over time in sync with the mother’s environment, which is one of the important health aspects of breastfeeding.Myth: If a woman has a poor diet the quality of her milk will not be good enoughBreastmilk is a living substance that evolves in sync with the needs of a baby at every feed. It contains vital nutrients, immunity building cells and stem cells, food for healthy gut bacteria and many other health factors that cannot be replicated. These do not change with an individual’s diet. People who experience famine conditions still produce milk providing optimal nutrition for their babies.The type of fat in maternal diet is closely related to the type of fat in the milk the mother produces, although the caloric content of human milk is fairly consistent.[i]Breastfeeding responsively ensures that babies will receive all they need in order to grow well and remain healthy.Caring for and feeding a baby from your own body can use up a lot of energy at times.  Eating a variety of nourishing and energy boosting foods as often as possible, can help to optimise your own health and energy reserves. Asking friends and family to provide such foods to you regularly in the early weeks and months can be a big support to you and your baby.Fact: Some foods can change the taste of breastmilkStrongly flavoured foods, such as garlic, chilli or soy sauce, may change the taste of breastmilk. It’s possible that this can help a baby get used to the family diet before starting solids.Babies will have already started to get used to these flavours during pregnancy when they swallow amniotic fluid.Children acquire their family’s food habits and preferences gradually.Fact:Breastmilk protects against toxinsAlthough a healthy diet could be defined as varied, balanced, and natural (i.e. grown in situations that eliminate or limit pesticides, insecticides, and chemical fertilisers), breastmilk contains high levels of antioxidants which may help to compensate for any pre-natal and post-natal exposure to environmental chemicals. Breastmilk can counteract the neurological effects of contaminants transferred before birth, and also any in the milk.Research has shown that milk produced by vegetarian women has lower levels of environmental contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These substances are stored principally in the fatty tissues of the body, and vegetarian diets tend to contain less fats than diets with more animal products.[ii][iii]It is generally suggested that anyone, breastfeeding or not, avoids fish which may be high in mercury. This includes predator fish such as swordfish and shark or freshwater fish from waters reported as contaminated by local health agencies.[iv]Mother’s dietMyth:You need to eat special foods to breastfeedA breastfeeding mother doesn’t require special foods to produce milk or increase her milk supply. Milk production is determined by the amount of milk removed from the breast.Unless there is a physical or physiological reason for low milk production, a mother who breastfeeds on cue will be able to produce enough milk for her baby, regardless of what she eats.[v]There is no particular food that must necessarily be eaten, especially if this is something that the mother is not used to or doesn’t like.[vi]All the nutrients that are found in one food are also found in others, so a mother can still get the nutrients she needs. For example, omega fatty acids can be gained through algal or soybean oil, walnuts, chia, hemp and flax seeds instead of fish.Myth:You need to drink milk to makemilkHuman beings are the only animals that consume milk produced by other animals.No other mammalian mothers drink milk, yet they all produce milk perfectly tailored to the needs of their young.Milk is sometimes seen as a source of calcium, but there are plenty of other easily available foods such a broccoli, peppers and spinach which contain even more calcium per serving as well as other nutrients too.In some cultures, people traditionally do not drink milk or eat dairy products at all, yet mothers succeed in breastfeeding their children.Myth:If you are vegan you won’t be able to breastfeedThe concept of an “ideal” diet can vary across different families, cultures, economic situations, religions, and also different seasons. Yet, almost always, all over the world, even in situations of deprivation, mothers produce milk that helps their babies grow well.Vegan diets can sometimes be low in Vitamin B12, and It’s important to know how to keep your vitamin B12 levels up.[vii]SeeVitamins and Mineralsfor suggestions on how to absorb enough.Fact: A breastfeeding mother may feel hungry and thirsty more oftenBreastfeeding can make us use up more calories than usual and we may feel more hungry and thirsty.How many extra calories we need depends on how much breastmilk we are producing (influenced by baby’s age and whether breastfeeding is exclusive), percentage of body fat (including how much body fat we have laid down in pregnancy), body size, and how active we are.A woman’s metabolic rate becomes more efficient during lactation and a small increase in grains, vegetables and fruit may be all that is needed.Weight gained during pregnancy is often gradually lost throughout the course of breastfeeding.Many mothers feel thirsty when they breastfeed, especially when their baby is newborn. It’s a good idea to have a glass of water available while breastfeeding, but it’s not necessary to drink more than you feel comfortable with, as it doesn’t help to increase milk supply and it may be unpleasant.[viii]Some women like to drink herbal teas and infusions to increase liquid intake. However, excessive amounts of some herbal teas and infusions can risk depleting milk supply, so they need to be used moderately and with caution.[ix]AllergiesMyth: Certain foods always need to be avoidedThere are no specific foods you always need to avoid just because you are breastfeeding.However, if parents suffer from allergies this can increase the possibility of their baby having the same allergy. Allergic reactions to substances in mother’s milk may appear as skin, respiratory and intestinal problems (or a combination of any of these) in a baby.If a baby has an obvious reaction every time a mother eats a certain food, she may choose to eliminate that food from her diet. Keeping a food diary can help identify if a pattern of fussy behaviour emerges every time a particular food is eaten.Although mothers may be advised to avoid high-risk foods during all or part of their pregnancy and to continue to avoid these foods during lactation, research indicates that this practice does not decrease the incidence of allergy by two years of age, but it does delay the onset of allergy.[x]More recent research shows that avoiding high-risk foods, such as peanuts, may not be necessary.[xi][xii]Normal caution may be needed if drinking raw, unpasteurised juices. If a mother were to develop food poisoning from inadequately washed ingredients this would not pass to her baby via her breastmilk.  However, it could be passed on via contact contamination.[xiii]Fact:Food allergies in breastfed infants are usually due to substances passing into breastmilk rather than breastmilk itselfSubstances in breastmilk coat a baby’s intestines, which prevent microscopic food particles from “leaking” through into your baby’s bloodstream.When food particles do pass into the blood (something that is more frequent in a formula fed baby), these food particles may be treated as foreign substances by his white blood cells, which attack them, and can cause painful allergic reactions.The top three food antigens are cow’s milk protein (mostly the betalactoglobulin component), soy bean protein, and egg white. Other common antigens are peanuts and fish, especially cod.Fact:A mother’s diet does not affect the amount of lactose in her milkThe amount of lactose in a mother’s milk has nothing to do with her diet; her body manufactures lactose solely for her baby.Lactose intolerance occurs when the body no longer makes enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to digest lactose, the main carbohydrate in milk. Lactose intolerance is rarely a problem for babies. They are born with the ability to produce lots of lactase because they depend on their mother’s milk for nutrition in the first year of life and the lactose in mother’s milk is needed for brain development.Some infants experience galactosemia, an extremely rare genetic condition that is present from birth and affects an individual’s ability to metabolise the sugar galacatose properly, hence requiring urgent medical care.Fact:Excess lactose in babies can be misdiagnosed as an allergy or colicHigh volumes of lactose can overwhelm a baby’s digestive system. This can be caused by babies consuming large amounts of breastmilk, or when mothers have oversupply.When there is not enough lactase to break down all the lactose, the excess lactose causes gassiness and discomfort, and frequently green, watery or foamy stools, sometimes with small amounts of blood.Vitamins and MineralsMyth:There is not enough iron in breastmilkThe iron in human milk is more readily absorbed by your baby than iron in cow’s milk or iron-fortified formula. This means that the quantity of iron in human milk is optimal for your baby, despite being less than that found in cow’s milk.As with calcium, the levels of this mineral in human milk are constant, despite variations in the maternal diet or the mother’s body stores.[xiv]A full-term healthy baby usually has no need of additional iron until about the middle of his first year, around the time he starts taking solids.Some vitamins and proteins are better absorbed if other vitamins and minerals are present at the same time. For example, iron is utilised better if vitamin C is present in the diet.[xv]The high lactose and vitamin C levels in human milk aid the absorption of iron, and breastfed babies do not lose iron through their bowels.Fact: Vitamin B 12 and calcium are important for a balanced dietVitamin B12 and calcium are important for a balanced diet. Some people, including vegans and vegetarians, use a supplement for their vitamin B12 intake.One study found that while vegetarian mothers tended to consume less calcium than other mothers, this did not affect the levels of calcium in their breastmilk.[xvi]If a mother is not consuming dairy products, calcium can be obtained from other sources, such as bok choy (a type of cabbage), sesame seeds, calcium enriched tofu, tamari, soy sauce, greens, whole grains and some nuts and dried fruit. For example, a cup (227 grams) of cooked bok choy provides 86 percent of the amount of calcium contained in a cup (240 ml) of milk. Half a cup (113 grams) of ground sesame seeds – which can be added to baked goods, pancake batter, or sprinkled on salads or cereals – contains twice as much calcium as a cup (240 ml) of milk.Other sources of calcium include blackstrap molasses, calcium-enriched tofu, collards, spinach, broccoli, turnip greens, kale, almonds, and Brazil nuts. Some types of algae (sea vegetables, such as wakame) fermented foods (miso), and seasonings including tamari and soy sauce can also contribute to enriching a diet with calcium, as well as many other minerals that are especially important to a breastfeeding mother.[xvii]Fact: Iodine and selenium are crucial mineralsIodine and selenium are crucial minerals. Good food sources of iodine include kelp, seaweed, sea fish, shellfish and grey Celtic sea salt. Iodine can also be found in plant foods, such as cereals and grains, but the levels vary depending on the amount of iodine in the soil where the plants are grown.[xviii]The best dietary source of selenium is Brazil nuts. It is widely found in other plant and animal foods, including other nuts, cereals, meat, fish and eggs.[xix]Fact:Vitamin D deficiency (rickets) occurs because of a deficiency in sunlight exposure, NOT because of a deficiency in human milk.Vitamin D is different from some of the other vitamins in our food, as it is actually a hormone produced by the kidneys. Vitamin D controls blood calcium concentration and affects the immune system, and is produced by the body when sunlight hits the skin.Breastmilk doesn’t naturally contain high levels of Vitamin D as, in the past, babies would absorb most of their Vitamin D from exposure to sunlight.Changes in the way we live our lives, with reduced exposure to sunlight, and with the foods we        eat which don’t contain sufficient Vitamin D, might mean that mothers don’t have enough            vitamin D in their own bodies to pass to their babies via breastmilk.Our bodies are designed to make very large amounts of vitamin D through exposure to the sun (10,000-20,000 IU in 24 hours, after 15-20 minutes of summer sun exposure in a bathing suit or 45-60 minutes of exposure for those with darker skin tones). However, in adults and children, the desire to avoid overexposure and sunburn has eclipsed our ability to absorb adequate amounts of sunlight to keep our vitamin D status at a normal level.[xx]Fact:Somewomen may need extra Vitamin DBreastfeeding mothers who have adequate amounts of vitamin D in their bodies can successfully provide enough vitamin D for their nursing children through breastmilk. However, lifestyle changes have led to some women not having enough vitamin D.It is recommended that pregnant and nursing mothers obtain adequate vitamin D or supplement as necessary. Women who are unsure of their vitamin D status undergo a simple blood test before making a choice to supplement.The optimal way to get Vitamin D is through sunlight and the NHS states: “Between late March/early April to the end of September, most people can get all the vitamin D they need through sunlight on their skin and from a balanced diet. You may choose not to take a vitamin D supplement during these months.”[xxi]The Vitamin D Council states that women taking a supplement of 6,000 IU of vitamin D each day shouldn’t need to give their baby a vitamin D supplement, as their breastmilk will contain enough vitamin D. However, women who aren’t taking a supplement or are taking less than 5,000 IU/day of vitamin D, or aren’t getting a good amount of sun exposure, should give your baby a vitamin D supplement.[xxii]If a baby is born with a deficiency in Vitamin D, due to the mother’s own low levels, this may not be reversed by the mother taking supplements.[xxiii]Research[xxiv]has demonstrated that children are able to store several months worth of vitamin D when they are exposed to only a few hours of summer sunlight.Gas/fussinessMyth: Food which makes a mother gassy will make her baby gassySometimes a mother finds that foods like broccoli and cabbage make her gassy. Gas from a mother’s intestinal tract cannot pass into her blood and eventually into her breastmilk for her baby to drink.However, when food is digested, some of the proteins do enter the blood and may then pass into a mother’s milk. Some babies may be sensitive to a particular protein and react with gas and fussiness.In many families, nursing mothers can eat whatever they like and be confident that the vast majority of babies do not have any problems with food proteins.For many fussy and gassy babies, the gassiness and fussiness can be due to other reasons, not always related to what food a mother has eaten.Written by Anna Burbidge for La Leche League GB, March 2019Further readinghttps://laleche.org.uk/breastmilk-and-the-environment/https://laleche.org.uk/too-much-milk-and-oversupply/https://laleche.org.uk/health-professionals/fat-content-breastmilk-faqs/https://www.llli.org/feeding-the-new-mother/https://laleche.org.uk/allergies/https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/allergies/https://laleche.org.uk/health-professionals/fat-content-breastmilk-faqs/https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/vitamin-d/https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/vitamins-nutritional-supplements/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-and-rickets/References[i]Sheri Lyn Parpia Khan.

Feeding late preterm babies,https://laleche.org.uk/feeding-late-preterm-babies/,"What is a “late preterm” baby?Late preterm babies are usually defined as those born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation.  Because these babies are often well – most don’t need to spend time in Special Care – and because they look like full-term babies (just a bit smaller), it’s often assumed that they will breastfeed easily from the start.Babies born before 37 weeks gestation are treated as premature.  Most late preterm babies do very well when they are born and, if they don’t need extra support with breathing, will usually stay with you.  Your baby’s doctor will want your baby monitored closely over the next few days to ensure his temperature is fine, his blood sugars are in the normal range, he doesn’t need treatment for jaundice and that he is feeding well.The following information may also be helpful if your baby was born at “early term” (37-39 weeks) but was small for gestational age, especially if under 2500g. It may also be helpful if your baby was born earlier than 34 weeks but is now at or after term age and still needs help with feeding.Small/early babies can be tricky to feed at firstSmall babies – those born early and/or small for their gestational age – can be tricky to feed at first, and it’s helpful to be aware of this.  They are sometimes known as “the Great Pretenders”, because they may spend a lot of time looking like they are feeding, but are not actually taking much milk!  This is because, even when well positioned and deeply attached at the breast, and encouraged to feed as often and long as they want, they often just don’t have enough energy yet to take what they need from the breast.  If they could, they would!Giving birth earlyGiving birth to your baby early, especially if you weren’t expecting it, can be a shock. You might feel worried about looking after a small, early baby, and confused about what to expect, even if you’ve had a baby before.  Doctors may be more involved in your baby’s care than if they had been born at term, and you might feel as if others are making decisions about your baby’s care which can be difficult to understand.  Knowing about the special challenges of feeding these babies can help you to make sense of what is going on.  Staff may be important partners in your baby’s care, but you, as the parents, are the most important people to your baby, so don’t be afraid to ask questions and make your wishes and feelings known.Some families know their baby or babies will be born early.  You may have a condition which means it will be safer to give birth earlier, and have opted for an early induction of labour or a caesarean birth.   Sometimes a placental problem is identified or the baby isn’t growing well and an early delivery may be the best option.Antenatal expression of colostrumIncreasingly, mothers who know in advance that their babies will be born early are choosing to hand express colostrum (first milk) before their baby is born.  Your body makes colostrum from as early as 16 weeks of pregnancy and with a little practice, you can learn to express (gently squeeze out) some of it, to keep until your baby needs it.  It is usually recommended to start doing this at 36 weeks, but if you know that your baby is going to be born before this, you can discuss with your healthcare team whether it might be helpful in your situation, and if so, when to start.Colostrum is usually yellow or orange in colour and known as “liquid gold” because it is so valuable for protecting your baby from infection and kick-starting their immature immune system.  Any farmer will tell you that baby animals who get their mother’s colostrum do better than those who don’t!  Expressed drops of colostrum can be frozen at home and brought into hospital at the time of birth.  As well as having colostrum on hand should your baby need it, expressing before birth helps you get to know your breasts and to practise hand expression, so if you are separated from your baby, or they are slow to get going with breastfeeding, you will have a head start on expressing colostrum after birth.You can find more information about expressing antenatally here:https://laleche.org.uk/antenatal-expression-of-colostrum/andhttps://laleche.org.uk/hand-expression-of-breastmilk/Skin to skin contactHolding your baby “skin to skin” (dressed just in a nappy, against your bare skin) has many benefits for all babies, but even more for late preterm babies.  Ask hospital staff to help you and your baby enjoy skin to skin contact as soon as possible after birth; you will soon become confident about how to get yourself and your baby comfortable.  The warmth of your body will help your baby stay warm and they will be calm and relaxed, saving their energy for feeding.  Late premature babies are usually sleepy and you may only get a short “window” of alertness before they fall asleep again.  While your baby is held against your chest you will get to know them and notice their subtle feeding cues as they move about, bobbing their head, licking their lips. You can gently help them move towards your breast and perhaps express some drops of colostrum onto your nipples for them to lick off.  They may latch on and have a little suckle.  Exploring your body and your breasts is an important part of your baby’s learning to breastfeed.  If they aren’t quite ready to begin breastfeeding yet, there’s no rush to make them start.  If your baby can breastfeed at all, even if they aren’t getting many calories from feeding yet, it can still be comforting and provide pain relief.  You may be able to feed them through medical procedures such as having a cannula put in – your medical team may be surprised how little your baby cries, if you work with them to find ways of doing this!Encouraging your baby to feedHaving a late preterm baby can be frustrating at times.  Although they might look like a slightly smaller version of a full-term baby, you can see that their prematurity affects the way they breastfeed.   Because they are immature,it is normal for their feeds to be sleepy and short, and for you to need to encourage them to wake and feed.In the early months,most babies need to feed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours, with at least 5-20 minutes of active sucking per breast (deep sucks, with swallows after every 1-2 sucks for most of the feed).  If your baby is too sleepy to do this much feeding yet, or if there are any signs that your baby might not be getting enough milk (fewer dirty nappies, more weight loss or slower weight gain than expected), it’simportant to act quicklyto keep your baby safely fed and to protect your milk supply.  You can read more about how to tell if your baby is getting enough milk athttps://laleche.org.uk/is-my-baby-getting-enough-milk/andhttps://laleche.org.uk/whats-in-a-nappy/Some babies need extra milk at firstIn the very early days, before your milk supply increases rapidly, and if they aren’t feeding vigorously yet, they may need more milk than the small quantities of colostrum you can express at this time.  Depending on the hospital, there may be donor milk available or your baby’s doctor may suggest infant formula for a short time until your milk supply increases.  In the early days and weeks after birth it is important to remove as much milk from your breasts as possible, as often as you can, to give your body a strong signal to make plenty of milk later.  Staff will support you to hand express at first (usually for about 3-4 days) and then to use a breast pump.   Make sure you know where and how you can rent or buy a breast pump for when you get home.You can read more abouthow to use extra milk(expressed milk, donor milk or formula) to support breastfeeding here:https://laleche.org.uk/formula-supplements/Growing into breastfeedingAs the days go by and they get closer to their due date, you will notice your baby getting better at breastfeeding.  Their feeds are longer, their sucking feels stronger, they wake by themselves and tells you when they are hungry.  You will start to find that they don’t want so much extra milk (and you may be able to express less), because they are taking more milk at the breast now. Keep closely in touch with your midwife or health visitor to ensure that as they take less extra milk, they continue to grow well.  It’s really tempting to stop expressing as soon as your baby is feeding better, but it’s wise to be cautious at this stage, and to reduce expressing and extra milk feeds gradually, while keeping a close eye on your baby’s nappies and growth.Nipple shieldsRecent research has suggested that some late preterm babies drink more milk when using a siliconenipple shield. The firm shield seems to help the baby with a weak suck to grasp and remove milk more effectively from the breast.  Not all late preterm babies will need a nipple shield, but they may be worth considering after day 4 or 5 if your baby is still very sleepy at the breast and their suck seems weak.  You can find more information here:https://laleche.org.uk/nipple-shields/.   You can talk to your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding supporter about whether this is a suitable option for you and your baby.Hard-wired to breastfeedParents sometimes worry that if their baby isn’t breastfeeding at all yet, or is breastfeeding but needs to use tools such as shields or bottles as well, that they will forget how to breastfeed.  You can be reassured that babies are strongly “hard-wired” to breastfeed, and will keep on trying for at least 8-12 weeks after birth.  You will notice that when your awake baby is placed face-down on your body, they start to move themselves around, as if they are looking for something.  If anything touches their head, they will turn towards it. They may smack their lips and suck their hands.  These are all feeding behaviours which are going to be useful to them in the months to come, and they won’t disappear for many weeks.Getting breastfeeding going matters but is it also very important to get your milk supply going!In the meantime, spending lots of time holding your baby skin to skin gives them lots of time to practise their feeding behaviours and to enjoy being near the breast.Balancing expressing and breastfeedingIf your early baby is spending a lot of time at the breast, it can feel as if there aren’t enough hours in the day to express milk.  Babies who aren’t feeding efficiently may spend most of their at-breast time sucking lightly (short, “fluttery” sucks, all the same length, with little or no swallowing) and complain when they are taken off the breast. Despite a lot of time spent “breastfeeding”, they don’t do as many dirty nappies as expected, or grow normally.  When this happens, it’s important to know what needs to be done first, so you can spend your time effectively.Removing milk efficiently from your breasts, to feed your baby and build your milk supply, is the first priority.  If your baby isn’t yet strong enough to do this themselves, you may need to limit their time at the breast for now, to free up enough time to express milk. Once you have a good milk supply, your baby has plenty of time to learn to breastfeed well when he is ready.How milk supply worksMilk supply usually reaches its peak level within the first month after birth, with most of this increase occurring in the first couple of weeks.  After this time, it tends to become more difficult to increase supply, and many mothers find it hard or even impossible to get more milk after about 4-6 weeks, however hard they work at it.  This is why it’s so important to start expressing early and often, if your goal is for your baby to be fully breastfed when he is ready.Some women do manage to get a significant supply increase later than this, though – you never know what you can do until you try!  If you’ve had aslow start with your milk supply, and are wondering if you can increase it, find good local breastfeeding support as soon as possible.Our article onhow milk production workshas more information you may find helpful.Here are some tips onmaximising your milk supply.For more information, please also see our article onincreasing your milk supply.Use your breasts as much as you can.More milk out = more milk made.  This is the main “rule” of milk supply, and much more important than any other factors, such as your diet, fluid intake, health or how unwell or tired you are (though of course you will feel better if you take good care of these things too!)  Milk removal doesn’t have to be doneregularly(with equal time gaps between), justas often as you can.While your baby is still small and tires quickly, it is likely that a breast pump is more effective than your baby at removing milk, so if you want to maximise your supply, it makes sense to prioritise expressing.  Aim to expressat least 8-12 times in 24 hours.  Expressing doesn’t need to be regular; do it whenever is convenient for you, even if this means expressing several times close together (babies often feed like this too!)  Try not to allow more than about 6 hours to go by without removing milk, though, since this causes your hormone levels to fall.The number of times per day you express is more important than the total time you express for,so if you only have a few minutes, it’s still worth it.  You can of course use any time left over for breastfeeding as much as you like!  Some mothers find that lining up 8-12 treats (e.g. chocolates or biscuits) each morning, and eating one each time they express, helps them to track how many times they are expressing, as well as rewarding them for doing it!  If you have a competitive streak, you might enjoy aiming each day to beat how much milk you expressed yesterday!Maximise efficiency at the breast.If there is any question about your baby’s effectiveness at the breast, skilled face to face breastfeeding support can help a lot.  Often, a bit of adjustment to how your baby comes to the breast can help to make the most of the time that he is feeding.  A slightly deeper attachment can make a big difference (and to your comfort as well, if you’ve had any pain or nipple damage).  However, even with comfortable, deep attachment, a small or early baby tends not to have enough energy  to remove all the milk they need, so just waiting until he grows a bit is likely to help a lot with their efficiency!  In the meantime,switch nursing and breast compressions,both described here:https://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-needs-more-milk/during feeds can help them to get more milk out in a shorter time.  Switching sides keeps the baby interested – flow is faster on the “new” side –  and compressions do some of the work for them.  As your milk supply increases, breastfeeding is going to become easier for your baby – he won’t have to work so hard to get milk out – another great reason to invest effort in milk expression at this stage!Use the most effective pump.For most women, this is a double electric “hospital grade” pump of the kind used in Special Care units, or the next size down.  Smaller (single electrics, or manual) pumps are designed for casual use, perhaps once or twice a day, rather than the big job of establishing a milk supply for a baby who can’t yet feed effectively.   Hospital grade pumps can be hired; your local LLL Leader may know of any pump agents in your area, or you can arrange hire online.Use “hands on pumping”.This is the most efficient technique that we know of, for getting the most milk in the shortest time.  How much you use your hands is probably even more important than what kind of pump you use, and whether you pump one or both breasts at a time.  “Double pumping” (both breasts at once) can be faster and more efficient, but some women find that it feels “too much” and prefer to express one breast at a time, using their hands to massage while they express.  You can find some great pumping ideas to try here:https://med.stanford.edu/newborns/professional-education/breastfeeding/maximizing-milk-production.html.  Hand expressing as much as you canafterpumping is probably the most important tip – the better you can drain the breast, the faster it will make milk.  A full hands-on expression session takes around 15-20 minutes, but it’s still worth expressing even if you don’t have more than a few minutes.Finish at the breast.Breastfeeding experts differ about exactly how to time formula or expressed milk supplements, but some say that theleasthelpful way to give them is always to offer themafterbreastfeeding.  This encourages dissatisfaction at the breast, and tends to undermine your confidence.  Supplements can either be given as a completelyseparatefeed (not offering the breast at all),orin themiddleof a breastfeed.  As long as the baby gets the right amount of milk in each 24 hour period, it really doesn’t matter exactly how it’s timed!  The goal is tofinish on the breastas often as possible.  It’s much nicer for your baby to feed off to sleep on the breast rather than the bottle, and for you to see them rolling off the breast looking full and happy!  Even if he isn’t breastfeeding at all yet, you can let them end their feed of expressed milk or formula milk with their cheek pillowed on your breast as they fall asleep.  A baby who enjoys being at the breast, and associates it with feeling satisfied, comfortable and happy, will be eager to breastfeed as soon as they are ready.Use feeding tools in ways that support breastfeeding.There are lots of ways to give your baby extra milk, if they need it.  Hospital staff may suggest that you feed extra milk by cup, or by nasogastric (NG) tube.  Sometimes, bottles are the most convenient way of giving extra milk.   Babies are hardwired to breastfeed, and once the underlying feeding issues have been addressed (or they have matured a bit more), they will usually happily begin or continue breastfeeding, whether or not they’ve needed alternative feeding methods.  Having said that, there are ways of using feeding tools that are more, and less, supportive of breastfeeding.  However you choose to give extra milk, feed carefully and slowly, paying attention to your baby’s signals, to keep feeding calm  for your baby and encourage behaviours that are useful at the breast.    You can read more about cup-feeding, “paced” bottle feeding, side-lying bottle-feeding and other ways of giving extra milk here:https://laleche.org.uk/bottles-and-other-tools/Consider domperidone.This is a prescription-only drug which has a side effect of increasing the levels of the hormone prolactin in your bloodstream.   It isn’t magic, but there is good evidence that for some women domperidone can help to boost milk supply, when combined with intensive milk removal as described above. If your GP is not familiar with its use for this purpose (and it isn’t licensed for this use, so your GP needs to be willing to take responsibility for prescribing it), these are useful resources to share:Breastfeeding Network – domperidone factsheetandUKMi – “Drug Treatment of Inadequate Lactation”.Get support from other mothers who value what you are trying to do. Any LLL group will welcome a mother who is working on her milk supply, and the other mothers will highly value the  effort you are putting in.    We warmly welcome anyone who is interested in breastfeeding or providing their own milk for their baby, whether or not they are currently breastfeeding – please don’t feel awkward about giving extra milk at a LLL meeting.  Many LLL groups are on Facebook too – it can be a great way to connect with other mothers whose babies have been born early, and who have overcome their early feeding challenges.See also:www.laleche.org.uk/how-to-increase-your-milk-supply/How much milk do I need to make?It might help to know that a week-old full-term baby takes about500ml in 24 hours, rising to an average of750ml in 24 hoursby 2-4 weeks after birth and staying at this level until the baby starts eating other foods, around 6 months.  Although every baby is different, with some babies needing more and some less milk than this, it can be helpful to have a rough idea in mind of how much milk to aim for when you’re expressing.  Even if your small baby doesn’t need this much milk yet, if your goal is to feed them only on your milk, it makes sense to aim for a full supply, so that you will have plenty of milk for them as they grow.Although formula instructions suggest increasing the amount in line with the baby’s weight (feeding a certain number of ml per kg of baby weight), human milk supply doesn’t work like this – the daily amount stays the same  from about 1-6 months, and this is probably a better guide.  If you can get to a full milk supply by the end of the first month, you’ll be making as much milk as your baby will ever need!Babies often go through a“catch up” phaseof drinking large volumes of milk and growing fast, until they catch up with their natural size.  You can tell when this happens, because their growth curve settles on one of the “centile lines” on the chart in the red book.  It is important to work closely with your health visiting team during this stage.  You will probably want to weigh your baby at least once a week until you and your healthcare team are confident that your baby is feeding well.If your baby has needed someformula supplements, you can find information on how to use and perhaps reduce them here:https://laleche.org.uk/formula-supplements/This is an art rather than a science, and it’s important to work with your local healthcare team and local feeding supporters with the skills and experience to work with late preterm babies.Early/small babies just need a little more time and supportWith time, and patience, this special group of babies can breastfeed beautifully – they just need some extra help at first, when they aren’t yet able to do all the work of feeding by themselves.  Knowing what to expect, being prepared for the extra investment of effort, and finding good breastfeeding support will help you to reach your breastfeeding goals.Key pointsIf you know your baby will be born early, consider expressing colostrum antenatally.This gives you a headstart with feeding your baby and learning how to express milk by hand.Keep your baby close.Holding your baby against your skin will keep them calm and happy, encourage them to feed, save their energy for feeding and help you to notice the small signs that he wants to feed (like smacking their lips and sucking their hands).  It’s the best way to get to know and enjoy each other.Keep your baby fed.Early/small babies might not ask to feed as often as they need to, and often tire quickly when feeding.  Your baby needs to be fed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours.  Short, frequent feeds usually work best.  Encourage them to feed whenever they show interest.  Watch your baby’s nappies and growth carefully to make sure he is getting enough milk.  Some babies may need extra milk (expressed mother’s milk, donor breastmilk or formula milk) at first.Keep your milk flowing.Milk supply usually reaches its peak level (around 750ml in 24 hours on average) within 4 weeks of birth.  Removing milk frequently in the early days and weeks gives your body a strong signal to make more milk.  If your baby can’t take all they needs  at the breast yet, express your milk with a pump and/or your hands, as often as you can, to keep your baby fed and ensure a good milk supply for when they are ready to breastfeed.Keep your goal in mind.Early/small babies will grow into breastfeeding, with time and patience.  Their path might be more complicated, and involve more people, tools and time than a full-term baby.  Get the support you need while you do some of the work of feeding for your baby, until they can do it all for themselves!Further

“Fussy evenings” with a newborn,https://laleche.org.uk/fussy-evenings-with-a-newborn/,"My baby feeds all evening, and my breasts feel empty – have I run out of milk?Every time I try to put my baby down to sleep, they cry! What am I doing wrong?Why does my baby cry at the breast sometimes, even though they still seem hungry?If you’ve ever asked questions like this during the rollercoaster weeks of new parenthood, you’re in good company! Most new parents, unless they have been around newborn babies a lot before, are surprised and sometimes confused by how intensely their baby needs to be held and comforted. At times, it can feel like very hard work, or even as if, whatever you try, nothing quite works. Babies on the TV might sleep quietly in their beds between feeds, but real babies often don’t!Here is some information that may help you make sense of your baby’s behaviour and work out whether there is a problem that needs fixing, or whether your baby is just doing what normal babies do. If you haven’t had your baby yet, reading ahead can help prepare you for what to expect, so that you take this stage in your stride!This article about normal newborn behaviour assumes that your baby is full-term, healthy, feeding well and growing normally. If your baby was born early, is unwell, or if you are not sure whether your baby is feeding or growing well, please check with your midwife, health visitor, doctor or breastfeeding supporter.Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of signs that more could be going on than just normal newborn behaviour:your baby’s poo output is less than expected (What’s in a nappy);your baby loses more than 7% of birthweight by day 5 or keeps losing weight after day 5;your baby grows at an average of less than 20-30g per day after day 5;your baby doesn’t wake at least 8-12 times in 24 hours to feed;your baby seems to be in pain;your baby cries inconsolably for hours, even in your arms;your baby develops patches of dry skin/eczema or a wheeze;your baby has green/mucousy stools or blood in their stool;breastfeeding is painful for you and not getting any better;your baby is often unhappy or frustrated at the breast;your baby often feeds for more than 40 minutes per breast or doesn’t stop breastfeeding until you take them off the breast.If any of these apply to you, please seek further help from your healthcare provider or a breastfeeding supporter.“Fussy periods”When they aren’t feeding, many babies sleep most of the time during the first few days after birth. This may be nature’s way of letting both mother and baby recover from their birth experience.Around 10-14 days old, though, your baby may “wake up”, sometimes quite suddenly, and you may be shocked by the change! From now on, your baby will spend increasing amounts of time awake. At times, it can feel like hard work to make sense of what they need and to help them get back to sleep when they have had enough of being awake.Many young babies have a “fussy period” of a few hours each day, when they especially need lots of calming and soothing. This is most commonly, though not always, in the evening and first part of the night, and tends to build in intensity over the next few weeks. The peak age for crying is around 6-8 weeks.Why babies need so much help in the eveningMany pregnant women notice that their unborn baby seems most active when they lie down at bedtime. This could be because they have stopped walking around and lulling their baby back to sleep!It is common for newborn babies to continue this pattern of evening wakefulness during the first few weeks after birth. By about 6 weeks, most babies are learning that the night is for sleeping, and (though they may still need to feed at night for many months) will begin to settle to sleep more quickly after a feed. You can gently help your baby learn the difference between night and day by taking them out in the daylight, especially in the morning, and keeping the lights low at night.Another reason for babies to be unsettled by the end of the day is that their brains feel like they are on fire! Babies’ brains are growing amazingly fast – they double in size in the first year. Every day, they take on lots of new information and experiences, and by the evening they are so excited by the day’s learning that it takes them a long time to wind down towards sleep.In busy households, with other adults and children coming back at the end of the day, some babies may find all the extra activity overwhelming, too. And if it’s been just you and the baby all day, by the evening you may be feeling frazzled yourself, and in need of nurture and care, just like your baby! Unlike adults, babies can’t just “switch off” and relax; they need lots of help from calm, loving adults.Breastfeeding – more than just milkBreastfeeding provides babies with much more than just milk. A frazzled baby seeks the breast because the rhythm of sucking, the closeness and security of being held, and the feel and smell of their mother’s body help them to feel safe and calm.Most babies like to feed more often in the evening. Milk flow might be a bit slower than it is first thing in the morning, but this isn’t a problem; it means that babies can do lots of calming, soothing sucking at the breast without getting uncomfortably full. If your baby cries when you offer the breast yet again, it won’t be because the breast suddenly doesn’t work! It’s much more likely that they’ve just had enough for the moment. The signals for “I’m hungry” are very similar to “I’m bored/tired/sad/uncomfortable/need a cuddle”. Your baby still needs help, they just don’t want the breast again right now.You can find some ideas below of other ways to soothe a frazzled baby. If you’re not sure what your baby wants, try offering the breast first, but if it seems to make things worse, try something else, and offer again when they are calmer.The “fourth trimester”Some experts talk about the “fourth trimester” of pregnancy; the first few months after birth, when babies’ brains are still in an “unfinished” state. Human babies have to be born while their brains are still relatively immature, in order to fit through their mother’s upright, restricted pelvis.Your baby will learn to calm down and manage their own emotions when they are ready, but a young baby can’t do this yet. You don’t need to be worried that, by giving them the help they need now, they will be “clingy”, “spoiled” or more dependent later. In fact, the opposite is true. Psychologists know that babies whose needs are met promptly early on are more likely to develop into trusting, confident children, because they find the world to be a safe place and know that they can always find help if they need it.In the early months, if you are managing to keep your baby safe, fed, comfortable and reasonably happy, you are doing a great job.A typical evening with a newbornYou feed your baby until they look fast asleep. You carefully put them down in their bed. Either immediately or soon afterwards they wake up and cry. You think they must be hungry… maybe breastfeeding isn’t working? You feed them again until you think they can’t possibly fit in any more milk, and put them down…. and so on, until the early hours of the morning.Although (especially if you haven’t breastfed before) you may worry that your baby cries at the breast because there’s a problem with feeding, as long as the signs of milk intake (weight, wet & dirty nappies) are OK (What’s in a nappyandMy Baby needs more milk) , and your baby is happier the rest of the time, it’s probably nothing to do with hunger, or a breastfeeding malfunction! Your baby is most likely to have woken up because they were put down.The conditions that adults might prefer for sleep – quiet, dark, being left alone – are scary for babies, who fear being abandoned more than anything. For our ancestors, a baby who was left alone was a baby who probably wouldn’t survive. Your baby has an “alarm”, carefully developed over thousands of years of human evolution, that is programmed to go off if they sense that they have been left alone.What can you do about it?Here are some ideas you might like to try:Babies, like other small primates, feel safest held closely against an adult body, especially an adult who is moving around. Try swaying or gently dancing with your baby.If you want to put your baby down, try to help them feel they are still with you: warm their bed, put something in it that smells of you, rock the crib, leave your hand resting on them while they fall asleep, etc.Wait about 20 minutes until they are in deep sleep before putting them down. If you put them down too soon, they are more likely to wake up, perhaps quite upset, because they wanted to be asleep.Carrying your baby in your arms or a sling meets most of the same needs as breastfeeding, and can be done by another adult. Dads or other close care-taking adults are oftenbrilliant at this. A baby who is not hungry will still head towards a milky breast if they smell it close by. If they really don’t want to nurse again, they might protest when they get there, which can be confusing for everyone!You don’t need to put your baby down if you don’t want to.If you do want to, enlist the support of other people who can get to know and love your baby. If you don’t have another adult living with you, could a family member or friend come and stay for a while? Do you have an older neighbour who misses their grandchildren? A teenager who is brilliant with babies? Even very young babies can have close relationships with several adults (and older children) at once, and another pair of arms can be helpful to both you and your baby at the end of a long day.Try going outside – babies are often happier outdoors.Babies often seem more relaxed when you are surrounded by other adults; they know the sabre-toothed tiger can’t get them! Visiting a pub garden can work really well on summer evenings. If you are at home and don’t have company, try the radio or TV on a channel with people talking.Experiment with singing, dancing, music, massage, bathing, rocking, walking.Try turning the lights and the noise down. Some babies are more sensitive to lights and noise than others.If you can do so safely, (Safe sleep and the breastfed baby) you might want to experiment with sharing a bed with your baby. Learning to feed lying down in a safely prepared bed means that you won’t have to move your baby once they are asleep, and you can get some rest while you feed. If you are worried about whether your baby will be safe in bed with you, you might want to try it in the daytime first, with another adult keeping an eye on both of you.Make sure you get something to eat (prepare a meal/snack in advance) and get a nap or at least a rest earlier in the day if you can, to prepare for the time of day when your baby needs you the most.Sometimes nothing works; you can still let your baby know you are there with them in their distress.If your baby is crying as if they are in pain, check with your doctor. There is more information here about possible reasons for crying. (Unhappy baby)If you feel overwhelmed by your baby’s needs, get help & support. Looking after a crying baby is really hard, but much harder if you feel unsupported. Your midwife, health visitor, GP or a parent support group can all help.Although attending a La Leche League meeting will not guarantee you more sleep, knowing that this phase is normal and will pass can really help. Other mothers who have experienced the intensity of the early weeks with a baby will welcome and encourage you. Many LLL groups offer support on Facebook too. (Find a group)You are working enormously hard to understand and meet your baby’s needs. Every baby is different, and you are becoming an expert on your baby. There is no “right” or “wrong” way to be with your baby (any more than there is a right or wrong way to be with a partner or friend); there is only what works for you both, today.This can feel scary at first (if only babies came with an instruction manual!), but as time goes on, you will feel able to try different ideas for calming your baby, and come up with some new ones. As the weeks go by, you will learn more about what helps your baby (and what doesn’t!) and become more confident about knowing when they are OK, and when to get help. As your baby gets older and more experienced, they will find the world, and their own bodily sensations, less alarming.These early weeks, which can feel like “forever”, will pass. Before you know it, you will be able to support a newer parent who is wondering how on earth they will get through it, because you did!Written by Jayne Joyce, on behalf of LLLGB, January 2019"
Bottles and other tools,https://laleche.org.uk/bottles-and-other-tools/,"Feeding breastmilk other than at the breastWhen the nursing mother and baby are separated or the baby cannot feed at the breast, they may need another way of taking breastmilk.These tips assume that your baby is being fed expressed breastmilk. If this is not available, please check with your baby’s healthcare provider.When is the best time to introduce a bottle?La Leche League’s manualThe Womanly Art of Breastfeedingsuggests that unless it’s essential, ideally the introduction of a bottle is left until the baby is at least three to four weeks old, and breastfeeding well. Milk supply can adjust to the baby’s needs more easily if they are able to breastfeed directly, and the more practice the baby gets at the breast, the more quickly they will become skilled at breastfeeding.Some people worry that if they don’t introduce a bottle early on, the baby won’t take one later. While a younger baby is slightly more likely to accept a bottle than an older one, it’s not a strong effect. Most babies of all ages will accept a bottle – some with a little coaxing!If you are thinking ahead to going back to work or study, but you won’t be doing this until your baby is older than six months, it may be reassuring to know that your baby probably won’t need a bottle by then. They will already be eating other foods and drinking water, and could be offered milk in their usual cup. Healthcare providers recommend that by a year, all babies (even those who have been completely bottle-fed) have stopped using bottles, because of their impact on teeth.When a baby isn’t able to breastfeed at all, or isn’t able to take enough milk at the breast, it’s important to start expressing milk early and often, to protect your milk supply and keep your baby safely fed. You can find information about this here:https://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-wont-breastfeed/https://laleche.org.uk/expressing-your-milk/https://laleche.org.uk/hand-expression-of-breastmilk/Ideas for introducing a bottle to a breastfed babyIf you would like to introduce a bottle, here are some ideas that have worked for other families:Choose a time when your baby is happy and relaxed, and not too hungry. It’s difficult to learn a new skill when you’re hungry! It can be helpful at first to think of it as a play activity, rather than a meal.Have someone else offer the bottle to your baby.A breastfed baby may be least likely to accept a bottle from his mother – they knows where they expect the milk to come from! This doesn’t mean that they won’t accept an alternative when she isn’t available. Even very young babies understand that different people care for them in different ways. Often, the best person to give a bottle to a reluctant baby is an experienced, confident bottle-feeder. Ideally, this will be someone who knows the baby well. Limit the number of people feeding your baby to no more than two or three; feeding is an intimate process, and it’s important that your baby feels safe and comfortable, and that the feeder can get to know your baby’s preferences.Hold the baby comfortably, but not lying in the crook of your arm.Babies who are bottle-fed lying on their backs can end up taking too much milk, too quickly. Very young babies (under about six weeks) can be fed lying on their side, on a pillow on your lap, with their feet towards you. Some younger babies, and most older babies feed best sitting up fairly straight, supported behind their neck and shoulders by your arm or hand.Gently present the bottle teat across the baby’s lips, to stimulate their gaping (mouth-opening) reflex and invite them to take the teat into their mouth. You could gently tickle their lips with it, as many mothers do with the breast. If they accept it, give them a good mouthful, so they aren’t just sucking on the end of the teat. Most babies do best with a teat that encourages them to open their mouth wide.Keep the bottle in a horizontal (flat) position,so the baby needs to suck actively to get the milk, as they do at the breast. This is often called “paced bottle feeding.” You will need to tip the bottle as it becomes emptier, so that there is milk at the end of the teat, but the whole teat doesn’t need to be full of milk all the way through the feed. Most babies do best with a slow-flow “newborn” teat; you might need to try a few different brands and teats to find one with a speed your baby likes (flow rate is not standardised across different brands). It typically takes about 15-20 minutes to finish a bottle – there’s no rush. Tilting the bottle to pour milk into the baby’s mouth can lead to them taking more milk than they need, faster than they can easily manage. This can cause discomfort, as well as frustration when he returns to the breast and the flow of milk is slower.Watch for signs that the baby needs a break.When breastfeeding, the baby waits for a few seconds up to a minute before the milk “ejects” in a rush, then gradually slows down, allowing natural pauses. Bottle-feeding can be tiring for the baby, because they have to keep sucking at the same speed throughout the feed. The following signs suggest they might need a rest: a wrinkled forehead (frown); wide, alarmed eyes as they gulp quickly; “starfish hands” (fingers splayed out); turning their head away from the bottle; suddenly going to sleep (not just gently drifting off as they become full and satisfied). If you notice any of these stress signals, or if milk spills from theirmouth, tip the bottle down to stop the flow, or take the bottle away, until she asks for more milk. If she doesn’t ask for more, she has had enough for now.As at the breast, babies may wanta feed that comes in two parts.Young babies may want a short nap (often about 10-20 minutes) before taking the second part of their feed. Most adults prefer always to give a bottle using the same hand, but you could even try turning them round to have some more on the “other side”!Alternatives to bottlesMost breastfed babies in the world never use a bottle, going straight from the breast to drinking from a cup. And a few babies who are offered a bottle simply refuse to take one, whatever their parents and carers try! Bottles are not the only alternative feeding method – there are lots of other options.Even premature babies can drink from anopen cup, with care and practice. Special cups are available, but any clean cup can work; some parents prefer a small one, such as a shot glass.To cup feed:Sit your awake baby upright on your lap, supported behind her neck and shoulders by your arm or hand.Place the rim of the cup on their lower lip and tilt the cup until the milk approaches their lip. Their tongue will explore and find the liquid. Thet will then lap or sip the milk – on the first few attempts, this may take a few minutes. You might want to use a bib or cloth to catch spills, until you’ve got some experience of feeding this way! Don’t pour the milk into your baby’s mouth. Keep the level constantly by their lower lip and allow them to rest and pause while drinking, but do not remove the cup.When they have finished, they will let you know by turning their head away, or by other obvious cues.To learn how to cup feed, try practising with another adult first – you will quickly work out how far you need to tip the liquid to avoid frustration or spills!Other feeding methods:For a tiny baby, other options for offering milk include a dropper, oral syringe or teaspoon.A baby who can breastfeed but needs extra milk as well could be fed using a nursing supplementer – a gadget that delivers milk via a tube that is taped or held next to your nipple. The baby takes both breast and tube at the same time, and gets milk from the supplementer as he nurses at the breast. Your LLL Leader can help you decide whether this might be a suitable option for you.You can find information about this here:https://laleche.org.uk/nursing-supplementers/Babies who can sit up may prefer to feed themselves (well supervised) from a regular cup or a “sippy cup” with a lid. If you are also breastfeeding, you may want to avoid models that rely on the baby biting or pressing firmly on a valve to get liquid out.Your baby may enjoy drinking milk from something he often sees you using, such as your favourite coffee mug – just make sure you wash the coffee out first!When your baby is fed by one of these methods, be sure to breastfeed often when you are together, to satisfy your baby’s sucking need.How much milk?Most breastfed babies take about 60-120ml (2-4oz) of breastmilk per feed, from 1-6 months of life. The composition of breastmilk changes as the baby grows, but not the quantity.This is different from artificial milk, which the manufacturers suggest needs to be given in increasing volume, in line with the baby’s weight as he grows. Some experts think that this leads to overfeeding, and may be one of the reasons why babies fed on formula milk are at higher risk of overweight and obesity in later life.If you are feeding carefully, in a “paced” way (as described above), you can trust your baby to show you how much they want at each feed. It may be a quick drink or a full meal – just like adults, babies don’t need all their feeds to be the same size.Make sure that the alternative caregiver doesn’t give your baby a lot of milk shortly before you return, though; you will probably want to feed as soon as you arrive, to reconnect with your baby and relieve your breasts!Changing feeding patterns when mother and baby are apartIt’s common for breastfed babies to refuse a bottle initially when their mother returns to work or study, while they adjust to major changes such as a new daycare environment and caregivers. Adults often feel less hungry when they first start a new job, too! The baby’s appetite will come back as they settle into their new rhythm and gets to know theircarers.Some babies may choose to “reverse cycle,” which means refusing a bottle or taking less milk than normal when away from mum, then nursing a lot when they are together. Breastfeeding isn’t just about milk, of course; allow your baby to “fill up” on cuddles, as well as milk, as much as possible when you are together. Give yourselves a week or two to adjust to your new pattern. As long as your baby’s nappy output and growth are normal, he’s getting enough milk.Babies older than about six months, who are also eating other foods, may choose to manage without milk altogether while you are away, managing fine with food and water until you get back. Babies often surprise their mothers by eating much more when you aren’t there than they do at home, especially if other children are also eating!When other people want to bottle-feed your babyOften family members sometimes express a desire to bottle-feed a breastfed baby as a way of “bonding” with them. They may be impressed by the powerful connection you are making with your breastfeeding baby, and want the same kind of closeness.It can be helpful to know that what strengthens attachment is touch (especially skin-to-skin holding) and gaze (looking into each other’s eyes) – not the transfer of milk. Fathers, co-parents and other key adults who spend lots of time holding babies skin-to-skin and sharing gaze and smiles with them experience a surge of nurturing hormones, like breastfeeding mothers do. If you want to promote a closer connection between your baby and the other important people in her life, encourage them to wear her in a sling, take a bath with her or just hang out together between breastfeeds, and let nature do its magic!Even very young breastfeeding babies can have strong, loving relationships with several people at once, including other close adults and siblings. Their mother is usually the centre of the baby’s universe, and especially if they are tired, upset or unwell, there will be times when “only mum will do”.Fathers and other close adults can feel frustrated and powerless, and wonder whether life might be easier for them if the baby weren’t breastfed. Experienced parents know that these early months and years pass quickly, and the time will come when the baby or young child reaches out to someone else, in preference to their mother! Older babies and toddlers typically go through cycles of intense connection with one favoured parent or carer, then another.In the meantime, there are many ways a loved one can help you and your baby at the same time.They can love, listen to and support the breastfeeding parent.They can change a nappy.They can bathe the baby.They can hold and calm the baby when he is not hungry, especially in those evening hours when young babies often need long periods of intensive soothing.They can “babywear” and spend time skin-to-skin.They can play with, sing and read to the baby.They can bring mum a glass of water, snack, phone, TV remote, or anything else she needs when she sits down to nurse.They can take care of housework, errands and meals.They can defend mum when others may not support breastfeeding or other parenting choices.They can be right there next to mum when she breastfeeds in public, helping her feel confident.They can contact a La Leche League Leader for help!Bottles are not a necessary part of a close relationship with the baby.Differences between feeding at the breast and being bottle-fedExclusive pumping (“EP”), when a baby is fed completely on his mother’s expressed breastmilk, is becoming more popular, for many reasons. Most mothers who express all their milk for their baby have experienced such overwhelming breastfeeding challenges that breastfeeding directly does not feel like an option for them. They invest precious time in milk expression so that their babies can still have the benefits of mother’s milk. This is a true “labour of love”.A few mothers may have the option of breastfeeding directly, but wonder whether expressing their milk and feeding by bottle isn’t just as good. It may be helpful to know that there are some differences between direct breastfeeding and “breastmilk feeding” by other means.Your milk has the highest level of antibodies when your baby takes it directly from your breast, and next highest when it is freshly expressed. Your body responds to your baby’s saliva – if your baby is exposed to something that he needs antibodies for, this need is communicated to your body as your baby breastfeeds.The longer milk is stored, the more the active components are deactivated. Your refrigerated or frozen milk still provides excellent nutrition and protection for your baby, just not as good as directly from the breast or freshly expressed.The activity of breastfeeding helpsexercise the baby’s facial muscles.This promotes the development of strong jaws and balanced facial structure. Several studies have shown breastfeeding to enhance speech development and speech clarity.iiiiiiIncreasing duration of breastfeeding is associated with decreasing risk of later need for braces or other orthodontic treatment. One study showed that young children with a history of suboptimal breastfeeding have a higher prevalence and risk ratio for malocclusions.ivother studies suggestbreastfeeding could reduce childhood stutteringBreastfeeding directly is alsoless time consuming– as any EP mother can tell you! There are no pump parts to wash, a skilled breastfeeding baby can remove milk faster than any pump, and the mother doesn’t need to spend extra time pumping and then feeding the expressed milk to her baby. When the baby is hungry or needs to be comforted, you simply put your baby to the breast, without needing to prepare the bottle and warm the milk.The benefits of skin-to-skin contactSkin-to-skincontact provides a baby with huge benefits. It increases the mother’s milk supply by helping her hormones to flow, and helps to “organise” the baby’s behaviour so that he learns to feed more easily. Babies who are held skin-to-skin cry less, saving their energy for growing, and have more stable breathing, heart rate, blood sugar, and temperature.When you are breastfeeding, you have to be in skin-to-skin contact with your baby, even if you don’t feel like it! And a baby at the breast is at the perfect distance for gazing at your face, basking in the warmth of your smile. When a baby is fed partly or entirely by bottle (or any means other than the breast), they can still benefit from lots of skin contact, holding and gaze – carers just need to be more intentional about it.Your baby might enjoy:Taking a bottle snuggled against your bare breastFalling asleep with their cheek pillowed on your breast at the end of a feed (some babies may be willing to use the breast to suck themselves peacefully off to sleep after a bottle-feed, even if they get most of their calories by bottle)Taking a bath with youBeing “worn” in a sling or front carrier near the breastLa Leche League is all about mothering – not just breastfeeding. While we believe that “mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural and effective way of understanding and satisfying the needs of the baby”, we know that when this isn’t an option, or can only be done some of the time, with care and thought, babies can be fed and mothered lovingly and responsively in other ways too. We have supported thousands of mothers to provide breastmilk for their babies by means other than the breast, and to have a wonderfully close, satisfying relationships with their babies. You can too!La Leche League groups welcome anyone who is pregnant, breastfeeding or providing their own milk for a baby, or trying to do so. Please don’t feel awkward about feeding your baby from a bottle or other means during a LLL meeting, or asking questions about it! Breastfeeding mothers understand better than anyone else the challenges of breastfeeding, and the work involved in expressing milk. We would love to meet you and your baby, and support you on your feeding journey.Originally published by La Leche League International in January 2019 and available athttps://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/bottles/You can see a poster about cup feedingherei Broad, F.E.

Tandem Nursing,https://laleche.org.uk/tandem-nursing/,"If you are breastfeeding during pregnancy, you may be wondering what happens after your new baby is born. Nursing a new baby while an older one is still nursing is generally referred to as tandem nursing. This could be after a pregnancy and the arrival of a new baby or having adopted a new nursling while continuing to feed your older child.Thinking about tandem nursing will likely involve considering and weighing up many variables. As a breastfeeding mother, you are aware ofhow important nursing is to your relationship with your older child. Deciding whether to continue breastfeeding him along with a new nursling or to wean him deserves careful consideration of both of your changing needs.Many mothers find making this decision particularly difficult. You may be drawn to both options at different times. Taking one day at a time may be helpful if you are unsure of what to do. Getting support in making your decision will give you confidence that you are doing what is best for you and your child.If you do decide to tandem nurse, you are not alone! Many mothers have tandem nursed two, or even three, children and found that it works for their family. Children who have been tandem nursed often continue to have a special bond throughout life, and mothers report that tandem nursing can help to ease the transition of having a new baby in the family.Why tandem nurse?Continuing to breastfeed your toddler through the stressful and highly emotional experience of gaining a sibling can help to make the transition smoother for them. They are less likely to be jealous of the baby who is allowed to breastfeed if they can nurse alongside them. The nutrition and immunological properties of breastmilk continue to be valuable and they can help your toddler through any illness, tantrums and fussy phases (“regressions”), which can sometimes occur. Nursing your older child once the new baby arrives can ease engorgement when your milk becomes plentiful and helps protect milk production if your baby is not feeding effectively.Breastfeeding during pregnancyBreastfeeding during pregnancy is a special experience for both you and your nursling and recent research on the safety of nursing during pregnancy shows that there is usually no reason for concern (you can read more about thishere). Your breastfeeding relationship may change throughout pregnancy to accommodate both your developing needs and the needs of your child. Around the fourth or fifth month (sometimes before), pregnancy hormones will probably cause your milk supply to reduce and its composition and taste to change. These changes may cause some children to nurse less or wean completely (you can read more about thishere).Nursing whilst pregnant continues to meet your child’s nutritional and emotional needs and it can be an opportunity for you to savour your unique relationship with your older child, before your baby joins the family. However, it can also be a challenging time for you and it may invoke intense feelings. Getting support at this time may be very beneficial, and you may find talking to an LLL Leader or going to your local LLL meeting really helpful. OurPregnant and breastfeeding?article has more information.Preparing yourself and your toddler for a new babyAdding a new baby to the family has a big impact, no matter if it’s your second, or your tenth! Children, particularly younger ones, may not feel emotionally ready to accept this big change easily. It is a good idea to prepare your toddler and any older children by talking about a new baby coming. Reading stories together and showing them pictures of babies nursing can help them to be more accepting when their sibling arrives.Many mothers find that they don’t receive the same offers of support during second or subsequent babies as they did for their first. It is important to remember that as a mother nursing two children (or more), any support given will allow you to focus on mothering your new family. Try to get plenty of rest and eat well before the new baby comes. Actively preparing your support network before your baby arrives will make the transition easier for you all. LLL groups are a great place to meet like-minded mothers whose support can transform your mothering journey.Labour and birth – tandem styleYou may be wondering how you will be able to provide for your older child during labour and whether she will be able to nurse or not. Having a dedicated caregiver for your older child who is able to give her expressed milk (if necessary) and get her to sleep will allow you peace of mind if you are unable to provide for her during labour.You may want to think about whether to have your older child with you during labour and birth or soon after the new baby arrives. If you are planning a hospital birth, you can inquire about access for your toddler and inform your medical team that you will want your toddler to be present during or soon after the birth. Some nursing mothers opt for a home birth, which usually allows more freedom for your older child to be included whenever you want her too.Breastfeeding releases oxytocin and can help to progress a slow labour. However, many mothers prefer to focus on the act of birthing and choose not to have their older child with them until the new baby has arrived.Your baby’s first breastfeed is a really special time. If your older child breastfeeds at the same time, this special moment will be part of their memories too.Any stitches you have had from a tear, episiotomy, or C-section will need to heal and you may find positioning your baby, older child or both challenging and may need a helping hand.Premature birth or complicationsWhen a baby arrives early or there are birth complications, it can be a really difficult and stressful time, which often involves a hospital stay and being separated from your older child. Although your newborn will need to take priority, trying to have your toddler for short visits whenever possible can be really helpful. If your newborn is unable to nurse right away, your older child can continue nursing and protect your milk production.The early days – what to expectWhen you give birth your body will continue to produce colostrum, with milk becoming plentiful after around 3-5 days. As with your previous baby, you will need to nurse at least 8-12 times per day to establish your milk production. You may worry about your newborn not getting enough colostrum if your older child is feeding too. Some mothers feed their newborn baby first or encourage the older sibling to nurse less if they feel their baby is not feeding enough. Look out for feeding cues and give your baby unrestricted access to your breasts to help ensure he gets plenty of milk. The more milk is removed, the more will be produced. Feeding cues to watch for include rapid eye movement, moving hands, squirming or rooting.Good positioning and a deep attachmentat the breast will help your newborn feed effectively. Encourage your baby to finish one breast before switching to the other.If you are expressing milk for your baby, your toddler’s nursing will help your supply.Hands-on expressingwhile your toddler is nursing may be particularly effective.See our pageIs My Baby Getting Enough Milkfor further information.Toddler nursing like a newborn?You may find that once your baby arrives your toddler starts nursing frequently again, just like your baby. Older siblings may enjoy increased milk supply, or simply be thinking about breastfeeding more as they see the baby breastfeeding often.If your toddler does increase his milk intake, he may lose interest in solid foods for a while as he enjoys your newly increased milk production. He may have looser stools.If you are happy to nurse your toddler as much as he wants, it can be a lovely bonding experience for the three of you. However, if you are feeling overwhelmed by his requests or not keen on nursing so frequently, you might like to try negotiating with your toddler about when and for how long he is allowed to breastfeed. See ‘Feelings’ section for more ideas.Separately or together?You may prefer nursing your baby and your toddler separately or breastfeeding both nurslings together. Your older child can access your breast in many creative ways!It can take a while before your body adapts to the needs of two different nurslings. Sometimes you may feel lopsided if one breast has been drained more than the other. Eventually things will settle down and you’ll have your own individual rhythm. Alternating breasts for each feed helps with development of newborn vision and keeps the size of your breasts balanced. However, some mums find that giving a toddler his ‘own side’ works for them.Tandem nursing positionsJust as with nursing one child, there are many different tandem nursing positions you can use which are comfortable and allow for milk to be removed effectively. You may need to experiment to find out what works for you when feeding two nurslings at the same time. Your older child might also have strong opinions about how she likes to nurse!If you plan to tandem feed out of the house, it might be worthwhile practising a few positions at home first, so you know you can get both nurslings on and off easily. Some mothers find it easier to position the baby first and let the toddler climb on, while others prefer to position the toddler first and then add the baby.Double cradle holdYour toddler is positioned curled around or underneath your baby, with each child’s head supported by your arms.Double underarm (clutch or rugby) holdYour toddler sits or semi-reclines with legs pointed away from you. Your baby is held underarm with his feet away from you. This position is good for protecting caesarean stitches or if your toddler sometimes kicks or disturbs your baby.Double side-lying holdYour toddler is positioned laying down next to you, then the baby is perched on top of your toddler.There are many other variations and combinations of the above positions which you can try.For more information about feeding positions for a single baby, see Positioning and Attachment.Fast flowWith each pregnancy your body makes more milk and an abundant milk supply/forceful let-down can be challenging for your newborn. Your older child might oblige and deal with the fast flow; otherwise, expressing just a little milk into a towel until the flow eases may help your newborn.FeelingsTandem nursing is a big commitment and emotions can run high at times. You may experience huge highs, deep lows, find it too demanding, and think it is magical, all within a short space of time. It can feel as if it will be this way forever, but it might be helpful to remember that babies are small for a short period of time and the dynamics between you and your two (or more) nurslings will soon change. Having realistic expectations about what you can manage at this point in time can be helpful.As a tandem nursing mother, you and your breasts are a focal point for nourishment and care for both of your nurslings. This can feel overwhelming and at times you may feel breastfeeding aversion or agitation. This can manifest itself in feeling ‘touched out’ and having the urge to limit your toddler’s nursing. Your reaction may be mild or quite severe with strong urges to stop feeding your older child.Many mothers report that the nursing agitation they feel is not an accurate reflection of their feelings about breastfeeding or their relationship with their toddler. In this case it may be helpful to do some detective work about why you may be feeling like this. You might realise that you are unwell, need more rest, are not eating well, are stressed about something, or are experiencing a bit of mother burnout. Prioritising self-care and having some time alone can really help to rebalance your mind and recharge. Carving out time for yourself, even if it is only 10 minutes, can give you the strength to manage. Taking time to rest is also important, and you can try to take advantage of daytime opportunities for a nap.If you want to put some limits on your toddler’s nursing, you might like to try negotiating with your toddler about when he is allowed to breastfeed, setting gentle limits about the length of his feeds by counting or singing, or pre-emptively offering snacks or playing games with him.Finding support from other tandem nursing mothers gives you an opportunity to talk things through with someone else. LLL meetings are a great place to meet tandem nursing mothers.Looking after yourselfWhen tandem feeding, you may be constantly thirsty, hungry and tired. It’s important to look after yourself by taking every opportunity to rest together and by eating plenty of nutritious snacks and meals. Feeding both children at the same time during the day is a great opportunity to try putting your feet up and relaxing. Accepting offers of help with shopping, housework and cooking from family and friends can be extremely helpful. Taking a few moments to nurture yourself can help avoid feelings of stress or exhaustion.Self-care is an essential part of mothering, particularly when your body is undergoing such large changes and ongoing demands.Try to make your needs clear to your partner/support person, as they will be better able to help you if they know what you need. Trying to keep expectations realistic reduces stress for you and the rest of the family. Particularly in the early days, your priority is looking after your new baby and older child(ren), so be kind to yourself.Eating for ThreeTandem nursing puts physical demands on your body as you produce enough milk to nourish two children. Fatigue can be a warning sign that you are not keeping up with your calorie intake requirements. It is a good idea to drink to thirst and eat as normal using your appetite as a guide.NighttimesManaging bedtimes with two nurslings can be a bit tricky. If you plan to breastfeed both children to sleep you might find you can feed both simultaneously lying down, then move one child once asleep. Or it might work better to have someone else available to hold/entertain one child while you nurse the other to sleep, then nurse the second child to sleep afterwards.It is possible to nurse both children during the night, but you may need to do some experimenting and find out which positions work for you. See ourSafe Sleep and the Breastfed Babyarticle for more information on safe sleeping practices.You may choose to night wean your toddler, but this might result in considerable effort and sleep-loss in the short term during the weaning period. It is helpful to consider whether night-weaning will lead to more sleep for you or if it will be more disruptive. If you do decide to night-wean, it can be helpful to have someone else put the toddler to sleep and go to them if they wake during the night.Becoming a big brother or sisterChildren react in many different ways to the birth of their new sibling. It is common for children to find it difficult to adjust to a new family member. As a tandem nursing mother, you may find that nursing your toddler (with or without baby) offers a welcome sanctuary from the stresses of the new family dynamic. Tandem nursing siblings often have an added bond as children and can have a special relationship throughout their lives.Occupying your toddler while your baby is nursingKeeping your toddler occupied while breastfeeding your baby may be a challenge you have not faced before. It can work well to set clear expectations about breastfeeding, so your older child understands what he is allowed to do during nursing time. Some older children react well if you give them a warning before you start breastfeeding your baby. It might also work well if you feed your baby in a sling, so your older child may not even notice your baby is nursing.Here are some ideas to occupy your toddler while you are nursing your baby:Have a special “breastfeeding toy box” which is only brought out when you are nursing your babyEnsure your toddler has got a snack and drink prepared beforehand to eat while you are nursingShare a book and a cuddle with your toddler while nursing your babyPlay verbal games with your toddler, for example “I spy”Ask your toddler to help you out, for example bringing you a nappy, a muslin etc.A time for weaningFor some mothers tandem nursing continues for quite a while. Others decide that weaning an older child and nurturing their relationship in a different way works better for them. If you decide to stop breastfeeding your older child, keep in mind that it may be a gradual process and one which needs gentle encouragement and patience.OurThinking of Weaning?article has information on weaning strategies. Talking to an LLL Leader can help you decide what is going to be best for your family.Adopting a second nurslingChoosing to breastfeed your adopted baby is a wonderful way of bonding with her. As a mother who is already nursing another child, you are in the good position of already having a milk supply flowing. You will probably need to increase your supply to cater to your new baby’s needs. See our article onRelactation and Induced Lactationfor more information on how to increase your supply and how to supplement your baby if needed.Tandem nursing your adopted baby and your toddler can create a special bond between all three of you which could last for life. However, breastfeeding your adopted baby may be challenging and you will benefit from a strong support network. Your local LLL meetings can be a great place to find this support.Written by Bronwyn Davies, LLL West Kent, July 2018Further ReadingBirth and BreastfeedingIs my baby getting enough milk?Dealing with criticismNipple PainPregnant and Breastfeeding?Relactation and Induced lactationSafe Sleep & The Breastfed BabyStill nursing?Thinking of Weaning?Toddlers and FoodWhen you don’t enjoy BreastfeedingSinkiewicz-Darol E, Bernatowicz-Łojko U, Łubiech K, Adamczyk I, Twarużek M, Baranowska B, Skowron K, Spatz DL.

Breastfeeding beyond infancy,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-beyond-infancy/,"Breastfeeding may not always be easy at first, but as the months go by many mothers find it is an important and enjoyable part of their relationship with their child, one neither of them is ready to bring to an end quickly. However, society is not always accepting or understanding of mothers nursing older children and women can find themselves under pressure from others who feel breastfeeding beyond infancy will be in some way detrimental.Sometimes mothers worry that they need to stop breastfeeding and have a number of questions and concerns about “full-term” breastfeeding and the criticisms they face. This article addresses some of them.At what age “should” a baby be weaned?There is no definite age at which a baby will wean: just as with other areas of development, there is a wide range. Some babies will need the comfort of breastfeeding much longer than others and ideally nursing will continue until both mother and baby feel the time is right to wean. This can’t always happen and sometimes a mother needs to wean earlier, but if the nursing dyad is happy, there is no reason to stop.Historically, until relatively recently, “extended” – or to better describe it “full-term” – breastfeeding was the cultural norm. According to anthropologist Kathy Dettwyler, in societies where children are allowed to nurse as long as they want, self-weaning usually happens between 3 and 4 years of age. Her research on breastfeeding duration in non-human primates (based on a number of variables such as length of gestation, weight gain, age at sexual maturity and dental eruption) places the natural duration of breastfeeding in modern humans between 2.5 and 7 years.For example, Dr. Dettwyler explains how, according to one study, weaning in non-human primates’ offspring happened when they had reached about one third of their adult weight, which happens in humans at about 5-7 years.  An analysis of weaning age and sexual maturity in non-human primates also suggests a weaning age of 6-7 years for humans (about half-way to reproductive maturity).[i]Dr. Dettwyler also says:“Many primates wean their offspring when they are erupting their first permanent molars. This occurs around five-and-a-half to six years in modern humans around the same time as achievement of adult immune competence suggesting that throughout our recent evolutionary past the active immunities provided by breastmilk were normally available to the child until about this age.”[ii]Is it harmful to continue to breastfeed?On the contrary, breastfeeding continues to provide comfort, security and protection against illness for as long as it continues.The American Academy of Pediatrics states that increased duration of breastfeeding confers significant health and developmental benefits for the child and mother.[iii]These extend well beyond the period of breastfeeding and there is evidence that the longer a baby is breastfed the greater the protection from ill health and the more positive the impact on long-term health for both mother and baby.[iv]The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine states: “Claims that breastfeeding beyond infancy is harmful to mother or infant have absolutely no medical or scientific basis.”[v]Can prolonged breastfeeding cause infertility?As a baby grows older, he usually starts nursing less or having longer breaks between feeds and this often coincides with the mother’s own recovery from birth. A high-need or fragile child may nurse more frequently, and this can contribute to temporary infertility which ensures the baby is fully ready for a sibling.Fertility usually returns around the time periods return, so if they haven’t returned and a mother is ready to for another pregnancy she may want to consider cutting out night nursing or having longer breaks between feeds. This will often kick-start fertility. An older toddler is unlikely to be feeding two-hourly.A short luteal phase – from the day after ovulation until a period starts – can affect fertility. This is associated with high levels of prolactin and a doctor might be able to prescribe progesterone supplements to correct this.[vi]If a mother needs to take fertility medications, there is usually no need to wean because most are safe for breastfeeding.  Although treatment may be less effective, it’s a personal decision to weigh up a baby’s need for breastfeeding against the wish to have another baby right away.[vii]Suckling has become painfulBabies are usually pretty good at adjusting their latch as they grow and their teeth come through, and many babies never bite.  Sometimes they need to learn how to adjust the way they nurse and if they occasionally forget, there are suggestions which can help. A baby can’t bite while actively sucking.Sometimes mothers find they have sore nipples when they are feeding an older baby and there may be many causes for this – a chipped tooth, food sensitivities or a gymnastic nursing baby! Sore nipples at this stage tend to heal quickly once the cause is found and it’s possible to chat to a baby of this age, explaining it hurts and asking her to be gentle.[viii]Am I making my child too dependent on me?It’s a common misconception that nursing an older child makes him less independent; we know of no evidence to support the comments that breastfeeding an older child leads to over-dependence on the mother.It’s not possible to force a child to be independent before he is ready. In fact independence, not dependence, is one outstanding trait that breastfed children who self-wean have in common.[ix]Natural weaning reflects differences in children and it’s a natural process for children to outgrow breastfeeding on their own, at their own pace. When a child weans gradually he feels emotionally attached to his mother for his comfort and security. Many weaned toddlers and pre-schoolers continue to have a need to suck for comfort, as shown by the continued use of a dummy or thumb, as well as the attachment to an inanimate object like a cuddly toy or a blanket.Breastfeeding provides feelings of love, comfort, and protection. When a mother is there to nurse her child through a situation that he can’t handle alone, he will likely develop independence based on faith that his mother will be there to help.[x]Allowing a child to nurse (or wean) at his own pace is an expression of trust that contributes to his self-esteem.[xi]Breastfeeding mothers benefit from being near their children, and children love the comfort and security that comes from being close to their mothers.Mothers are sometimes told they will “spoil” their children by responding to them but in fact it’s been found that when mothers respond to their children they are less likely to cry.[xii]When babies are small their “wants and needs” are the same thing.  As a child grows he can’t always tell the difference between what he wants and what he needs, but knowing his mother is there for him helps him feel secure and to learn with kindness how to respond.[xiii]I’d like a bit of time to myselfMothers of young children are often urged to separate from them and being “too attached” is sometimes seen as a negative. Strong attachment to a parent is a normal need that is part of children’s development.[xiv]It is perfectly normal for children to like being close to their mother; they will grow to be independent by feeling secure, not through forced separation.Over the past few decades, many eminent child psychologists have found that children thrived better if parents acknowledged their offspring’s feelings and understood the need for attachment. Communicating with children about how they feel has been found to lead to a better relationship than an authoritarian approach.[xv]English psychiatrist Dr. John Bowlby developed the concept of “attachment theory” according to which a warm, close, enjoyable and continuous relationship with a child’s mother (or permanent mother-substitute) has a positive effect on a child’s well being.[xvi]Older nurslings are usually able to cope well with their mother doing other things and to understand how their relationship works, because they know they feel secure. There is no reason why a mother can’t have some time to herself while still enjoying their breastfeeding relationship.If a mother returns to paid work her older nursling is usually able to adapt well to being away from her, in the knowledge that when they are both home again he will have the comfort of breastfeeding. Mothers enjoy that special reconnection too.You can read more about separation here:https://laleche.org.uk/when-mum-cant-be-there/Doesn’t my child need to learn to “self-soothe”?It is interesting that the term “self-soothe” is so often used as something children need to learn, when it was actually a word invented in the 1970s during research undertaken by Dr. Thomas Anders of the University of California, Davis Medical Center. He used it to describe children who went to sleep on their own after waking, as a contrast with babies who cried when they woke up. He called this “signaling”. He wasn’t trying to say self-soothing was something to aim for, but the description has come to be adopted as a fact rather than a research term, with far more meaning than was intended.When a child is left to cry himself to sleep, there is no way of knowing if, when they stop crying, they have fallen asleep or have simply gone into a “withdrawn” state where they have given up hope of being responded to. While babies may indeed stop crying if left unattended long enough, they are not learning to “self-soothe”, they are simply giving up on the hope that comfort will come.It’s acknowledged that adults in relationships enjoy being close to each other and sleeping in the same bed. It is comforting to wake in the night and feel the presence of someone we love next to us.  This raises the question of why babies or children should be expected to sleep alone, left to cry and “self-soothe” when adults aren’t.Will still breastfeeding mean he won’t eat enough solid food?Nearly all babies can make the gradual adjustment to eating solid food without any trauma, while continuing with the comfort of breastfeeding. Mothers are sometimes told that the longer they breastfeed, the harder it will be to transition their child to solid foods. We know of no evidence to support this, as most babies will be ready for solids sometime after six months of age. Just because a baby continues to breastfeed doesn’t mean he isn’t eating other food too. Breastfeeding a toddler is very different from nursing a newborn.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends mothers worldwide to exclusively breastfeed infants for the first six months of their life in order to achieve optimal growth, development and health. It also recommends that infants continue to be breastfed for at least two years, and as long as mutually desired, while being given nutritious complementary foods.[xviii]Can prolonged breastfeeding cause malnutrition and low energy?The physiological process of weaning is complex and involves microbiological, biochemical, nutritional, immunological, and psychological adjustments for both mother and child.[xix]Most importantly, during the weaning process the composition of human milk adjusts to meet the needs of the growing child so that, although the volume is decreasing, an appropriate level of nutrients remains present and immunological protection is not compromised.[xx][xxi]If an older child is being offered a variety of healthy foods alongside breastfeeding, there is usually no cause for any concern. It’s often overestimated how much food a young child needs, and children who have stopped breastfeeding can also have small appetites. There is some evidence to show that breastfeeding might protect against obesity by helping a child to better regulate their food intake.[xxii]Breastmilk is also invaluable when an older child is unwell and can’t take solid foods.I’m ready to stop but my child isn’tThere are often ebbs and flows in a breastfeeding relationship.  Sometimes older children can have times of intense need when, after having reduced how much they nurse, they suddenly seem to want to breastfeed a lot; sometimes mothers can feel overwhelmed by this and ready to stop nursing.  If this happens, it is worth thinking about anything which might have unsettled the child – such as a change in family life, a move, more hours spent at nursery – and trying to meet the increased need for a while. Children often sense when their mother is no longer happy with the nursing relationship and this can make them feel insecure and even more interested in breastfeeding.It can seem like life would be much easier without nursing, but it’s important to remember that even after weaning, your child will still need to be comforted, may still wake up at night, and will still need a lot of attention. Having a bit of time to yourself doing something you enjoy (like taking a bath, reading a book, going to an exercise class or taking a walk) while a trusted friend or family member plays with your child can be really helpful.Spending time with like-minded mothers who understand how you feel and support you in your choices can make a big difference.  Filling up our own “emotional reservoir” is very important to be able to meet the needs of our children.Nursing is a relationship between two people and if it no longer feels right to you and you really want to stop breastfeeding, there are lots of gentle ways to wean your child. For example, some mothers choose to wean during the day but still nurse at night, or vice versa. Older children are surprisingly good at understanding and adapting to new nursing routines.You can find lots of ideas about gentle weaning here:https://laleche.org.uk/thinking-of-weaning/I’m pregnant, do I need to stop breastfeeding?Very rarely does a mother need to wean her child to maintain a pregnancy.  With uncomplicated pregnancies, there is no need to wean and nursing will not harm the growing foetus.[xxiii]Women are sometimes told that the release of oxytocin during breastfeeding will stimulate uterine contractions resulting in early labour. However, oxytocin can be released for other reasons (such as orgasm and extreme happiness) which women aren’t cautioned against.It’s not unusual for nursing mothers to feel some nipple tenderness or pain during early pregnancy. Later on, it’s very common for mothers to feel impatient when nursing their older child, also because a drop in their milk supply may make it uncomfortable to feed. This seems to be nature’s way of putting the new baby first, even though nursing doesn’t have any harmful effects on the growing foetus.[xxiv]Whether to wean or not is a very individual decision. Some mothers decide to overcome any discomfort because they know nursing is so important to their child, particularly if he’s still young; others feel it is better to gradually wean. Some mothers wean during pregnancy, but  start nursing the older child again after the baby is born. The “don’t offer, don’t refuse” weaning method is a good way to assess if a child is ready to wean. Some older children choose to wean as they lose interest due to the lack of milk or change in its taste.A useful book on this subject isAdventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding during Pregnancy and Beyondby Hilary Flowers.[xxv]The Australian Breastfeeding Association booklet on Breastfeeding through Pregnancy and Beyond is also helpful.[xxvi]You can find more information on this topic here:https://laleche.org.uk/pregnant-and-breastfeeding/What if my child starts asking “awkward questions” about nursing?Sometimes mothers are told that if a child is old enough to ask to breastfeed then they are too old to do it.  However, many mothers find nursing a child who is old enough to articulate a source of great joy. It can be a cause of happiness and contentment for both.  Older nurslings often make both amusing and heart-warming comments about their need to breastfeed.  Many a mother has got to the end of a difficult day and then sat down and nursed her child and been overwhelmed with love for her little one.  It’s a great way to relax for both of you.If they can ask, they can also understand that it might not always be appropriate to nurse.  Many older babies are happy to nurse at home for quick “comfort stops”, unlike a younger child who needs to nurse straight away.  Even if a toddler is so distressed that he needs to nurse quickly, mothers are great at finding ways to do this while out and about. It can be useful to have a family name for nursing that a child can use when out that allows for discreet toddler nursing if desired.The sexualisation of breasts in today’s society can mean that mothers are sometimes warned that continued nursing might have future consequences for older nurslings, such as overstimulated sexual feelings. Sometimes mothers worry if their little boy has an erection when he is nursing. This is perfectly normal, can also happen during cuddling and can be ignored. Responding warmly to a child’s needs will add to his future security, not harm him.[xxvii]Other people’s criticism is hard to cope withIt can be hard to deal with negativity and criticism from others, especially well-meaning relatives. A lack of understanding about why a child might continue to breastfeed can lead to people, even strangers, making hurtful and misinformed comments.It can be especially hard if a partner no longer feels comfortable with an older child breastfeeding. Sometimes, when children are walking and talking and still nurse, partners worry that they may be too dependent on you.It can help to listen to how your partner feels and to talk about why nursing is still important for you and your child, explaining how breastmilk is still nutritious, protects from illness and gives comfort and security.   What seems like a long time now, will only be a short part of the childhood years. Sometimes it can be helpful for partners to talk to others whose children have nursed for longer, or to see children who have fed for a long time and are now outgoing and independent.You can read more about dealing with criticism here:https://laleche.org.uk/dealing-with-criticism/Acceptance and supportIdeally, how long to breastfeed will be a mutual choice for each mother and baby. However, in order to breastfeed for as long as they intend, women need accurate information and appropriate help, as we work towards creating a society which accepts and supports breastfeeding as the norm for as long each mother-baby dyad wishes to continue.Finding like-minded mothers, knowing you are not alone, that you are doing the right thing for you and your child and feeling supported in that choice, can make all the difference.  It can give a mother the confidence to listen to the needs of her own child and not feel pressured by a society which may have different expectations as to how babies and toddlers behave.  La Leche League group meetings are great places to find mothers who understand why some children breastfeed for longer than others.You can find your nearest LLL group here:https://laleche.org.uk/find-lll-support-group/Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, April 2018Further reading: Mothering Your Nursing Toddler by Norma Jane BumgarnerReferences:[i]Dettwyler, K.A Natural Age of Weaning.http://whale.to/a/dettwyler.html(accessed 8 February 2018).[ii]Dettwyler, K.

I think my baby’s got colic,https://laleche.org.uk/i-think-my-babys-got-colic/,"When a baby cries for a long time without any obvious cause parents are often told their infant has colic. This is a “catchall” description for when a baby cries incessantly for around three hours a day and cannot be comforted. The crying generally happens in the afternoon or evenings. It often starts in the early weeks and usually stops by about four months.It can be extremely distressing for a mother to listen to her baby crying without knowing what is wrong or what to do to comfort her child. It’s easy to start to wonder if breastfeeding is to blame, particularly if others suggest it might be.What causes colic?Sometimes the cause of colic is never uncovered and may be related to the baby’s own personality or temperament. Some babies are more sensitive than others and need more comforting. It’s not unusual for a baby to cluster feed in the evening both for comfort and to increase milk production, and crying which is labelled as “colic” may simply mean that the baby needs to nurse again.For other babies, the discomfort can be traced to overabundant supply of milk, overactive letdown, reflux or occasionally allergies. Sometimes a baby is still feeling discomfort from the birth process.Positioning and attachmentColic-type symptoms can appear if a baby is having problems latching onto the breast. A shallow latch can lead to babies taking in a lot of air which then causes discomfort. The birth process can sometimes leave babies with tension in their jaw and neck, which makes it hard for them to open their mouth wide enough.This article gives a lot of suggestions on how to encourage a deeper latch and finding a position which may be more comfortable.https://laleche.org.uk/positioning-attachment/Tongue-tie can also cause difficulties with latching and positioning and can be distressing for both mother and baby.  You can find more information in this article:https://laleche.org.uk/tongue-tie/OversupplyThe baby may be gaining weight well,but seems fussy at the breast. She may pull off the breast spluttering and a mother may see a forceful milk flow. The baby cries and wants to nurse,but seems angry and arches away. Her poo may be green and frothy, rather than yellow, and she seems windy and unhappy.This articleexplains the causes of oversupply and gives a lot of suggestions on how to improve things.RefluxReflux and colic are closely related and are often confused. Reflux can also be caused by oversupply and both are more often a problem when a baby is given large feeds with long gaps in between. A baby who has reflux often spits up milk and cries more when he is lying down or is in a car seat.This articletalks about identifying reflux and offers ideas to help.AllergiesMothers with a fussy baby often wonder if something in their diet is to blame. Some cultures whose diet includes spicy foods have a special, milder diet for nursing mothers for the first month or so. Most babies are not bothered by any foods their mother eats, but if a baby comes from a family with allergies and seems fussy, it can help to keep a food diary just to see if any particular food triggers discomfort.There is more on allergieshere.Culture-Induced Colic?One study by Ronald Barr, a paediatrician at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, looked at infant crying patterns.[i] It suggested that some crying is normal, but it may be prolonged by modern practices such as longer intervals between feedings. Dr. Barr compared the results of a study on the !Kung of South Africa[ii] with the typical ways in which American and European infants are handled and fed. The !Kung carry their babies with them constantly and feed them whenever they cry. Babies may be fed three or four times an hour for a minute or two at each feeding.Dr. Barr asked some mothers to carry their babies for at least three hours a day and these mothers reported that their babies cried only half as long as babies who were not carried for the extra three hours.What can I do for my unhappy baby?Many fussy babies are more settled if they are kept close to their mother and can nurse whenever they need to. Offering the breast calms many a crying infant, especially if his mother has been trying to limit feeds because of sore nipples or to try to space nursing.If that doesn’t work, then just holding him and carrying him may help. Especially for babies with reflux, being held upright is much more comfortable than lying down. All babies have wind and many aren’t particularly bothered by it, but if it is making him uncomfortable an upright position can help move gas bubbles that are causing him pain.A useful phrase is “contact, carry, walk and talk”: research has shown that these steps, used in a sequence as needed, can significantly reduce crying in many babies.Many mothers have found the following ideas mentioned inThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding[iii] helpful:Respond right away. If a baby is picked up and comforted before he gets too distressed it is usually easier to calm him.Try to use a soft baby carrier as much as possible. A baby likes to be close to his mother and being upright is often more comfortable. It is easier to respond when he needs to feed. Going out for a walk may be relaxing for you both.Try the Magic Baby Hold/colic hold (pictured). This can be a really helpful calming technique, especially for a well-fed but fussy baby. The baby is held with his back against his mother’s chest so both are facing forward. Mother’s left arm goes over the baby’s left shoulder and holds his right thigh. The baby will have one arm either side of his mother’s arm and his mum will have a solid grip on his leg. He can face the floor or be hugged against his mother so he faces outwards or even with mother’s hand (still holding his thigh) on her hip. Mum has her shoulders relaxed, and a hand free if needed. In this position the baby is also on his left side, which some babies find more soothing.The “baby bounce” can be added to this hold. It can start with simple swaying, then adding a “hitch”. Although the baby’s face is not visible, it’s possible to feel his body’s tension, so if the back of his head starts to wrinkle or his body starts to tense the next things is to turn just a bit so he sees something different. Mostly the baby bounce and change of scene will help.Burp her.Change her nappy.Undress her completely – her clothes may be causing her discomfort.Swaddle her in a light blanket.If she is overstimulated, take her to a quiet room.Rock her.Sing to her, talk to her, or make loud “shh” noises while keeping her in your arms.Try different positions such as laying her on her tummy and rubbing her back, or carrying her tummy down across your forearm.If the baby is being fussy at night and it feels like you are the only ones awake in the whole world, it might help to go outside or look out the window at the moon and think about all the other mothers and babies out there under the same moon.A nice relaxing bath together can calm both mother and baby, and some babies who are refusing to nurse will naturally latch on in the warm water.Some babies like a gentle massage (there is one called the “I love U” massage in The Fussy Baby Book by William and Martha Sears).Go out and about or run errands during the baby’s fussy time to entertain him.Dance with him.Put the baby in a sling or blanket “hammock” and swing him gently either head-to-toe or ear-to-ear.Chiropractic adjustments have been suggested to alleviate colic in some babies.[iv]If he really wants to nurse, nothing will help but nursing!Is anything helping?When a baby cries non-stop and it’s hard to comfort him, it’s easy for a mother to feel she is doing something wrong. She may start to think she doesn’t know how to mother her own child or even that he is doing it on purpose. Well-meaning friends may suggest the baby is manipulating his mother, but babies aren’t capable of this. They don’t understand why they are in pain and just want the comfort of their mother’s arms.If he continues crying even when held, it can seem to a mother that she is not helping her baby, but it is never a waste of time to cuddle him. In fact, a baby needs his mother more than ever at this time. Even if he doesn’t know why he is unhappy, having his mother close helps him feel safe and loved.Finding support from othersLooking after a crying baby can be exhausting and stressful. If it gets to the point where a mother feels at her wits’ end, it can help to ask someone else to hold him for a short time while she takes a break and makes a hot drink or has a snack. If she is on her own and really feels like it is too much, then lying him down somewhere safe, just for a few minutes while she goes to another room and takes a few deep breaths, can restore her ability to comfort her little one.[v]It’s sometimes suggested that a baby be left to “cry it out”, but prolonged crying is physically and emotionally very stressful and may have an impact on the wiring of the brain.[vi] If left, a baby will stop crying eventually but learns that her needs for comfort have not been taken seriously. Responding to a baby’s cries builds security and independence in the future.[vii]You can read more about the risks of letting babies cry here:https://laleche.org.uk/letting-babies-cry-facts-behind-studies/Mothers of crying babies need a lot of emotional and practical support. It is tough having a constantly crying baby but it does end. Lots of fussy newborns grow into relaxed, happy six-month olds. While it is ongoing it can help to find a circle of friends you can complain to. At LLL meetings mothers will be able to empathise, offer suggestions and encouragement during this challenging part of motherhood.You can find more information here:https://laleche.org.uk/unhappy-baby/Recommended reading:The Fussy Baby Book by William Sears and Martha SearsColic Solved: The Essential Guide to Infant Reflux and the Care of Your Crying, Difficult-To- Soothe Baby by Bryan VartabedianThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, 8th Edition, by La Leche League InternationalWritten on behalf of La Leche League GB by Anna Burbidge, March 2018.Referencesi Barr, RG et al.

What legal rights do breastfeeding mothers have when returning to paid employment?,https://laleche.org.uk/legal-rights-breastfeeding-mothers-returning-paid-employment/,"Many women plan to return to paid work in the months following the birth of a baby, either through choice or necessity. Knowing your rights and planning ahead can help you continue to breastfeed after your return.What are the options?• If a woman has worked for an employer for at least 26 weeks she can request flexible working hours, asking for changes to her days, hours or place of work.• She can ask for shorter shifts, to work part-time or move from evening/night shifts to day in order to continue breastfeeding.• The employer is legally required to give the request serious consideration and can only refuse for good business reasons.• This could be a temporary change in contract while she is breastfeeding.• It may be possible to work from home for all or some of the time or even bring the baby to work.Planning ahead• It’s a good idea for women to make a flexible working request at least two months before returning from maternity leave, or to discuss this option during pregnancy.• Sorting out breastfeeding breaks at least three weeks before returning to work will allow for adjustments in routine.• It is indirect sex discrimination for an employer to refuse a flexible working request from a breastfeeding mother if there are not good business reasons for the refusal, and if it results in the mother stopping breastfeeding.• It’s important to tell an employer about the need to express milk at work. Breastfeeding/expressing breaks in the workplace are not a statutory requirement, but the Equality Act 2010 considers failing to assess or take action on health and safety risks for a breastfeeding woman as sex discrimination. Providing employees with breaks to breastfeed or express may reduce health risks, such as that of developing mastitis.• Employers are required by law to provide a breastfeeding mother with a place to rest, and this could be used as a room to breastfeed or express. The provision of washing facilities and a clean secure fridge to store milk are recommended.• Providing breastfeeding or expressing breaks has positive results for both employer and employee. Women who feel their employer is supportive are more likely to return to work and have higher morale, productivity and overall satisfaction.Finding support and informationYou can find more practical help and suggestions here:Working and breastfeedingWorkday practicalitiesWhen mum can’t be thereIf you leave your babyAccommodating Breastfeeding on Return to WorkMaternity Action has published a leaflet for employers entitled Accommodating breastfeeding on return to work and it also provides information for mothers on continuing to breastfeed when returning to paid work .Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, March 2018Further readingMaternity Action.
