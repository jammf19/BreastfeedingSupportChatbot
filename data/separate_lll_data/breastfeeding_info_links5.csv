Letting Babies Cry – The Facts Behind the Studies,https://laleche.org.uk/letting-babies-cry-facts-behind-studies/,"One of the biggest adjustments a new mother may have to make is to realise that babies can need their mothers twenty-four hours a day. From the moment a woman gives birth she can find herself bombarded with a vast array of ideas and suggestions, and this can lead to confusion on what she might expect.In particular, where, when and how much a baby should sleep is the subject of much confusion and contradiction.Parents may have been given unrealistic information on how much a baby will sleep, and their expectations might not be developmentally or physically appropriate.The baby may be labelled as having a sleep problem when, in fact, he is exhibiting normal behaviour.Questionable methodology of studies which suggest babies should be left to cryLLLGB disagrees with the methodological approach and the conclusions of a study from Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, which was recently published in the journal Pediatrics.1The researchers studied 43 sets of parents, with babies between 6 and 16 months, who felt their child was having problems sleeping. They divided the group into three sets: one group was asked to leave the child and wait longer and longer before going back to comfort him (graduated extinction); the second group was able to stay in the room until the child dozed off (bedtime fading); and the control group did not attempt any sleep training.After three months, the researchers found that the babies in the first two groups fell asleep more quickly and woke less during the night. They tested for levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, and found that babies had lower levels during sleep training interventions at the time they were tested. Moreover, one year after the interventions, parents didn’t report more behavioural problems compared with the babies in the control group. Michael Gradisar, Associate Professor of Psychology at Flinders University, said there was no evidence that “crying it out” was stressful for babies, and that he believed it gave peace of mind surrounding bedtime.2This study echoes research led by Psychology Professor Marsha Weinraub of Temple University in Philadelphia, published in Developmental Psychology in November 2012.3Weinraub was quoted as welcoming the Flinders study and she said that the gains in sleep would help both babies and parents. She added that the most important aspect of the study is that both sleep training techniques seem safe for babies in the short and long term, and that the study disproves expert opinions about the detrimental long-term effects of sleep training methods in terms of children’s stress levels and problematic behaviours. However, Professor Gradisar himself mentioned that while sleep training appears to improve sleep without detriment on the child or family, more independent trials are needed to validate the findings of his study.4Measuring StressNew parents who are feeling sleep deprived and are confused on whether to leave their baby to cry could be misguided by this new research, and it is therefore important to stress that when the study is looked at in detail, the results are not as positive as they may at first seem.In order to measure the babies’ stress, the researchers tested their levels of cortisol, but these tests were done in the morning, and there is no way of knowing just how stressed the babies were while they were crying themselves to sleep, or if their sleep would have been any different if they had fallen asleep in a calm state. In addition, when follow-up tests for cortisol levels and to gather sleep data were conducted at 1 and 3 months, only 28 and 23 participants respectively out of the initial 43 were included in the study. Although the full 43 participants were included in the 12 months follow-up tests, the small numbers in the various groups could mean that any differences and effects might not have been detected. The study also neglected to record data such as the babies’ feeding method, sleep arrangements, and if they were in any sort of day care.5Claims that babies need to crySome popular baby care manuals in the first half of the 1900s gave mothers a very unrealistic idea of how much babies needed to sleep, and some of the baby ‘experts’ of that era were convinced that babies needed to cry. It was thought that a baby’s lungs didn’t fully expand unless they were exercised every day. Mothers were terrified with the tale of a baby who died of pneumonia at the age of 8 months because he had never been allowed to cry.6Leaving babies to cry because it is supposedly good for them is a long way from the calmness we aim for today, and yet, some modern day ‘gurus’ still cling to this idea. In her recently republished book, The Baby Book, maternity nurse Rachel Waddilove says she teaches mothers that it is ok for babies to cry. In a comment which could be an echo of the misinformed statements of the 20th century, she says: “Very often a baby’s normal way to go to sleep is to have a shout, air their lungs. If you rush to them you interrupt the pattern of them falling asleep”.7It would be considered very distressing for an adult to cry themselves to sleep each night, and the same is true for a vulnerable baby calling out for his parents in the only way he can.Leaving a baby to cry may, possibly, give short-term relief to the family who may get a better night’s rest. However,there are many studies which disagree strongly with the claim that leaving a baby to cry is not stressful. The 1999 Ontario Early Years Study8explains how the brain is being hard-wired in early development and how the patterns which emerge will last for a lifetime. How the adult brain reacts to stress is influenced by this early development, and adults who were stressed as babies can have abnormal stress reactions in later life, as well as a greater vulnerability to social attachment disorders.In 1998, Harvard research showed that babies who cried excessively were susceptible to stress as adults, and sensitive to future trauma.9Chronic stress in infancy can also lead to an over-active adrenaline system, causing anti-social and aggressive behavior, and even affect physical illness far into the future.While the Flinders study claims to have found no ill effects, the participants would need to be monitored for many years into the future for this to be clearer.On the other hand, research has shown that infants and toddlers who experienced responsive and sensitive care tend to develop into socially competent pre-schoolers.10Are there any sleep training gains?The Flinders study found that, after three months, babies in the cry-it-out group fell asleep almost 15 minutes faster than babies in the control group, and those in the bedtime fading group went to sleep about 12 minutes faster. Commenting on the Flinders study, Professor Weinraub said: “When you are waiting for your baby to go to sleep, every minute counts”11, but this assumes that the time spent with a baby is something to be wished away. The Flinders study also found that, one year after the interventions, babies in all three groups had about the same amount of sleep because sleep health improves naturally as babies get older. This would seem to indicate that babies would have started sleeping more without any intervention.It is not easy for mothers to leave their baby to cry. It isn’t meant to be. A baby’s cry is intended to elicit a response from its caregiver. It is extremely distressing for a mother to listen to her baby calling for her and yet to believe that not responding is the best thing for their child, even when it seems so wrong.Leaving a breastfed baby to cry may alter normal feeding patterns, and unnaturally longer sleep patterns may affect the protection regular waking gives babies in regulating their breathing. There seems to be very little gained by leaving a baby to cry, and a very small, short-term increase in sleep time would have to be balanced against the stress caused to both parents and infants.“Self-soothing”Many proponents of sleep training claim that it is really important for babies to learn to fall asleep on their own. Professor Weinraub says: “When mothers tune in to these night time awakenings and/or if a baby is in the habit of falling asleep during breastfeeding, then he or she may not be learning how to self-soothe, something that is critical for regular sleep”.12While babies may indeed stop crying if left unattended long enough, they are not learning to self-soothe, they are simply giving up on the hope that comfort will come. The term “self-soothing” was invented in the 1970s during previous research by Dr. Thomas Anders, but it has come to be adopted as a fact rather than a research term, with far more meaning than was intended. There is no way of knowing if, when babies stop crying, they have fallen asleep or have simply gone into a “withdrawn” state where they have given up hope of being responded to.13It’s interesting to note that adults in relationships enjoy being close to each other and sleeping in the same bed. It is comforting to wake in the night and feel the presence of someone we love next to us. It raises the question of why a baby or child should be expected to sleep alone, left to cry and “self-soothe” when adults aren’t.Should babies be expected to sleep through the night?The Flinders study assumes it is normal to expect babies to sleep through the night by themselves by a certain age. However, in many cultures, co-sleeping and breastfeeding are the norm. The idea of putting a baby to sleep in his own room alone has only been considered normal in industrialised Western societies over the last hundred years or so. We may have changed our expectations of what is normal, but a baby’s need for his mother’s milk and proximity to her body remains the same.Professor James McKenna of the University Of Notre Dame, Indiana, says that human babies are born developmentally immature and require parental (especially maternal) smell, touch, sounds, and movement in order to feel secure and have their physical needs met at an optimal level14.  All primate infants, including humans, biologically expect to be in close contact and proximity with their caregivers.For hundreds of thousands of years mothers have effectively combined co-sleeping and breastfeeding to provide for their babies’ immediate social, psychological, and physical needs.According to James McKenna, mothers and babies who sleep with or close to each other develop coordinated sleep patterns, so it is often much easier to wake when the baby needs feeding or comforting and to fall back to sleep afterwards.When deprived of the physical comfort she needs, a baby will use her primary survival response — crying to attempt to attract the attention of her parents. By using cry-it-out methods to train their babies to sleep, parents are severing the link between crying and response. They are ignoring the very thing which is meant to ensure an infant’s survival.What about parents?Looking after a new baby can feel exhausting. Weinraub’s 2012 study claimed that mothers of babies who woke persistently were more likely to be depressed, although it recognised this needed further research.In fact, recent research by Kathleen Kendall-Tackett indicates that mothers who were exclusively breastfeeding reported significantly more hours of sleep, better physical health, more energy, and lower rates of depression than mothers who were mixed- or formula-feeding.15One of the things many parents find useful is to know that what they are experiencing is normal. Just knowing that they are not alone and that night waking is something many others experience can make all the difference. When parents are led to expect that babies should sleep through the night at a certain age, that they should learn to sleep on their own and ‘self-soothe’, parenting doubts and concerns can arise. It can be helpful to talk to other parents who understand their difficulties, including those who have seen their children develop and start sleeping through the night when they are ready. The age at which this happens will vary greatly from child to child and labelling a child who wakes up as having a “sleep problem” can be misleading.If a mother is feeling exhausted, it may help to look at the family’s life as a whole and ask if anything can be done to make it easier. Are there times in the day when the mother might be able to make time to sleep? Perhaps a trusted friend or family member could be asked to come to the house and keep an eye on the baby for an hour or so in the day while the mother has a rest, or give a hand with household tasks. Taking a short break to do something she enjoys, or even having a relaxing bath, can revitalise her and make it easier to give time to the baby. Knowing that night waking is normal and will pass helps to create a more positive feeling. Believing that it is wrong and you should be doing something about it builds negativity.Many parents already instinctively stay with their baby while he falls asleep and avoid stressful crying. Some mothers also decide to keep their baby right beside them during the night and find this much easier than attempting an unrealistic bedtime routine.Making a decision which feels rightAll parents need to make choices which feel right to them, basing their decisions on accurate information. While “experts” may assure parents that they shouldn’t feel guilty about not comforting their babies when they are crying, many parents find their instinct to go to their child is hard to ignore. In her study, Weinraub says that parents should “resist the urge to respond right away to awakenings”.16Ideally, this kind of decision would be based on what the parents feel is best for them and their own baby, rather than academic advice.La Leche League GBLLL accredited Leaders are mothers who have breastfed their own babies and know that when a mother needs a bit of help it can’t wait until tomorrow.

Breastfeeding and Taking Exams,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-taking-exams/,"Breastfeeding mothers who need to sit an exam can feel concerned about how to manage separation from their babies while they might need a feed, as well as how to avoid the health risks of not removing enough milk from their breasts.One of the first routes may be to talk to the examiner and explain the situation. It may be possible to make special arrangements to accommodate breastfeeding.Shorter length examsMothers who have to take exams of around three to four hours have found various ways of coping.When Anna found her exam was scheduled for three weeks after her baby’s birth, she asked for an invigilator to come to her home. She arranged for another carer to be there for the baby, nursed just before the exam started, and then took the three-hour exam without a break, finishing just as the baby was ready for a feed. It was the longest the baby had ever gone between feeds!Claire needed to take an exam when her baby was five weeks old. She built up a supply of expressed milk beforehand, just in case the baby got upset, and during the exam her mother put the baby in a sling and went for a long walk. Claire had arranged beforehand that if her baby got upset her mother would text the invigilator, who would quietly take Claire out of the room. She would be allowed to nurse the baby, in the company of another staff member and without speaking to anyone, before returning the baby to her mother. Claire got through the exam without being called, but says the first feed afterwards was wonderful!One mother of twins arranged beforehand for a set break to go and nurse her babies.International Board of Lactation Consultant ExaminersIBLCE exam candidates normally sit a continuous four-hour computer based exam. Breastfeeding mothers of babies under 12 months can arrange a scheduled break.  For a baby older than 12 months there is an extra charge to cover the cost of an extra proctor to be with them while away from the exam centre.  Some mothers of younger babies have found they could arrange to have their baby in a nearby room with a carer.Further information can be foundhere.What about longer exams?Some mothers find they are unable to avoid taking a long exam while still breastfeeding and it has sometimes proved difficult to arrange adequate breaks for expressing. While provision can be made for examinees with specific needs to have extra breaks, the needs of breastfeeding mothers have not been specifically addressed in this context in the past. However, in 2007, a US mother fought a decision not to allow breaks for expressing milk when she had to take a long medical exam and the court found in her favour. It ruled that the issue was one of gender discrimination and nursing mothers should be given extra break time to express milk during long exams.Possible legal routes within GBIf a woman is told she cannot express her milk during exams, the first route might be to explain the potential health consequences, such as engorgement and mastitis. The following acts might help.Equality Act 2010According to the Equality Act of 2010, treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding a child of any age is considered sex discrimination. Having to sit an exam in increasing discomfort and with the possibility of health consequences might be considered unfavourable treatment. A mother might be able to bring up the issue of sex discrimination as a relevant factor in the decision to allow her to take pumping breaks. If she is denied such breaks, she can contact the Government Equalities Office. A solicitor can advise on whether a claim can be brought for discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act.Human Rights ActIt may also be possible to object under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which regulates the right to respect for private and family life. Amongst other things, this applies to a woman’s right to physical integrity and autonomy, i.e. what she does and doesn’t do with her own body. A mother might also argue under Article 3 that it is inhuman and degrading to be prevented from removing milk from her body, particularly if she is refused the right to pump. A mother would need to make it clear that she is being put at serious health risk by not being allowed to express breastmilk.After the examAs Claire found, after the exam breastfeeding provides a way for mother and baby to reconnect. The baby may be a little more fussy and may want to nurse more, but any drop in milk production should soon be resolved.  Prior communication about the situation, an understanding of why a break may be needed, and good planning can all help to ensure taking the exam goes as smoothly as possible.Written by Anna Burbidge and Johanna Rhys-DaviesCopyright LLLGB 2016"

Pregnant and Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/pregnant-and-breastfeeding/,"If you’re expecting a baby and are continuing to breastfeed your older child, many questions may be going through your mind. Mothers  can breastfeed while pregnant; some go on to nurse both their new baby and their older child after the birth. This is known as ‘tandem nursing’.Breastfeeding during pregnancy is a special, unique relationship and one that may constantly evolve to take into account your changing needs and those of your older child. Breastfeeding can help you meet your child’s needs more easily, especially if he is tired or unwell, and it continues to give him important nutritional and immunological benefits. However, breastfeeding whilst pregnant can often invoke intense feelings. Extra support at this time can be crucial and you may find talking things over at your local LLL meetings really helpful.Is it safe?NutritionMorning sicknessMilk supply and colostrumManaging when you are not enjoying itCoping with questions and commentsDeciding to weanTandem feedingFurther ReadingIs it safe?Research tells us there’s usually no reason why a mother shouldn’t breastfeed while pregnant. Although breastfeeding may help a slow labour to progress, the amount of oxytocin normally released is not usually enough to cause the cervix to open before it is ready to do so.  Oxytocin is also released during sex, which is generally considered to be safe during pregnancy.  If you are expecting multiples or considered to be at risk for miscarriage/early delivery you may be advised to stop breastfeeding. You could discuss this with a breastfeeding-friendly caregiver.NutritionYou won’t be depriving your unborn baby of nutrients by continuing to breastfeed so long as you eat reasonably well. Getting plenty of rest and eating nutrient dense food will help you stay well-nourished and healthy.The UK Department of Health recommends that all pregnant women take a vitamin D and folic acid supplement (often taken in the form of the Healthy Start vitamins).Calcium needs during pregnancy and the first six months of breastfeeding it is normal to experience a gradual loss of bone density. Even if breastfeeding continues, recovery of bone mineral content (BMC) starts from around 3–6 months and is generally complete by about 12 months after birth. If a mother has breastfed there may even be a small overall increase. When a mother becomes pregnant again before 12 months BMC actually continues to increase and tandem nursing mothers have no increased risk for osteoporosis. During pregnancy your body absorbs more calcium from the food you eat. If you feel your diet is low in calcium, then eating foods rich in calcium (eg leafy greens, nuts and seeds) may be a good idea but otherwise there’s no need for any extra.Morning sicknessPregnant mothers often have nausea, whether breastfeeding or not, though breastfeeding while pregnant may make it worse. Eating frequent healthy snacks can help manage nausea, as can getting more rest. Some mothers find motion sickness wristbands work for them.Milk supply and colostrumAround the fourth or fifth month (sometimes before) your milk production is likely to reduce due to pregnancy hormones. The composition of your milk will also change and become more similar to weaning milk. Your child may nurse less or wean completely. Some children resume nursing at a later stage. The drop in milk production is due to hormonal changes and nursing more frequently or pumping won’t increase production in the same way it does when you are not pregnant. Your baby may need age appropriate supplements and a baby under 12 months may need his weight monitored. Continuing to breastfeed during pregnancy has no effect on the milk supply that you will have following the birth of your new baby. Colostrum is produced during pregnancy whether or not it is being removed.Managing when you are not enjoying itYou may experience nipple soreness, increased nausea and/or feelings of irritability caused by pregnancy hormones. Limiting nursing times, (eg to a few minutes or even a few sucks), ensuring a deep latch, distraction, and offering other snacks/liquids can all help to make nursing through pregnancy more manageable. Support from family and friends can help you get more rest.Coping with questions and commentsPregnancy and breastfeeding can be an emotionally challenging time. It can be difficult if you hear negative comments from others. Talking about the importance of breastfeeding to you and your child can sometimes help people appreciate that this is something you have carefully considered and that it is your choice for your family. Sharing information/research and surrounding yourself with supportive people can also help.  Yourlocal LLL groupwill be a good source of support.Deciding to weanThe decision to stop breastfeeding is a very personal one and one only you or your child will make. It is useful not to have too many expectations when you get pregnant.Tandem feedingContinuing to nurse your older child after your new born arrives can help maintain and strengthen your special bond. Mothers often say that tandem feeding helps their older child to be more accepting of their newborn sibling and helps them through the emotional transition of having to now share their mum. Tandem feeding can also foster a special bond between the siblings.

Breastfeeding in Public Spaces,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-public-spaces/,"Breastmilk is instantly available for babies and is wonderfully convenient wherever a mother is. This is particularly important as babies have small stomachs and breastmilk is digested very quickly.  However, many mothers worry about breastfeeding in public spaces and are unsure about their rights in the event of negative comments from other people.What does the law say?It is entirely legal to breastfeed in public places anywhere in the UK.According to the Equality Act of 2010, treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding a child of any age is considered sex discrimination. This applies to any business or premise providing services to the public, including public institutions, associations and higher education bodies.Service providers dealing directly with the public must not discriminate, harass or victimise a woman because she is breastfeeding. Discrimination includes refusing to provide a service, providing a lower standard of service or providing a service on different terms.Can cafes, restaurants and shops ask a breastfeeding woman to leave?Businesses, such as a cafes, restaurants and shops, are not allowed to ask a woman to stop breastfeeding her child or refuse to serve her. This is applicable to mothers breastfeeding children of any age, as the law protects them for as long as they wish to breastfeed their babies.If anyone being served in a cafe takes offence at a breastfeeding mother, the business owner could offer to move them to a different table, but it is against the law to ask the mother in question to leave because she’s breastfeeding.A guide produced by the Government Equalities Office to explain the 2010 Equality Act to businesses selling goods and services states: “A business may ask a breastfeeding woman to leave their premises if the reason for this request is not due to her breastfeeding. However, if the woman later claims that discrimination occurred because she was breastfeeding, the business will have to prove that there was in fact no discrimination.”It is possible that individual business employees, owners or managers may not be aware of these regulations and may tell a woman that she cannot breastfeed on the business premises. If this happens, the mother can challenge their request.If still asked to stop breastfeeding or leave the premises, a woman can contact the Government Equalities Office. A solicitor can advise on whether a claim can be brought for discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act.What about communal public spaces?If a mother is out with her baby she may need to stop and breastfeed. She is not required to cover herself or go to a specific feeding room, but people may occasionally object.In England and WalesA woman cannot be prosecuted for breastfeeding under public decency laws. A mother can ignore people who ask her to stop feeding and she can just carry on. Unfortunately though, she has no specific legal protection against their actual comments objecting to breastfeeding. If, however, the remarks become aggressive or abusive then women have a right to report this as with any other form of abuse.In ScotlandUnder Scottish legislation, it is an offence to deliberately prevent or stop a woman from breastfeeding in a public place. If a mother is approached by anyone, anywhere, and asked to stop breastfeeding, she has the right to phone the police who will attend, discuss with the person involved, and warn them that they are committing an offence liable to a fine of up to £2,500.In Northern IrelandBreastfeeding mothers are protected by sex discrimination laws that prohibit anyone from treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding and the Government intends to introduce specific legislation to support and protect breastfeeding infants and their mothers in public places.Breastfeeding is normalAlthough in recent years breastfeeding may have been considered something which should not be done in public, limiting nursing when out and about can restrict your baby’s food intake. Breastfeeding is the most natural way of understanding and satisfying your baby’s needs and its importance in terms of promoting healthy development for both baby and mother is officially recognised by healthcare organisations all over the world. The more often breastfeeding is noticed, the more easily it will be accepted by the public, leading to a change in people’s attitudes and a reduction in any criticism.Written by Anna Burbidge and Eva WilliamsCopyright LLLGB 2016Further readingOut & about with your breastfed babySupporting women’s right to breastfeed2010 Equality ActInformation for New Mothers, Pregnant Women and Families – Information about Feeding a Child in Public and Private Spaces: The Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005"
Relactation and Induced Lactation,https://laleche.org.uk/relactation-induced-lactation/,"Ask any breastfeeding mother why she’s chosen to breastfeed. She’ll probably tell you about the benefits to herself, her baby and her family, as well as the joy and satisfaction of meeting her baby’s needs for food, protection and security through breastfeeding. Mothers who stop breastfeeding after a difficult start may miss this experience. And when a much-longed-for baby is adopted or born by surrogacy, the reasons for breastfeeding can be just as powerful and compelling.Breastfeeding is more than the provision of milk, with its protective and nourishing qualities. An adoptive mother may choose to nurture her baby at the breast, regarding any breastmilk as an added benefit. And mothers who relactate often do so to re-establish the breastfeeding relationship.Will I make enough milk?Relactation—a second chance at breastfeedingBreastfeeding an adopted babyMilk ProductionGetting StartedSupplementationIncreasing Milk Supply By BreastfeedingWhen a baby is reluctant to breastfeedMoving away from supplementsExpressing breastmilkGalactogoguesDefine your own successMaintaining Milk ProductionWill I make enough milk?This will depend on your individual situation. Many mothers find they can produce enough milk to be able to give up supplements totally. While there is no guarantee that you will be able to meet all of your baby’s needs, you can maximise the amount of breastmilk they receive. Any amount of breastmilk is beneficial. Even if you haven’t managed to cut out supplements totally by the time your baby is over six months old, solid foods can gradually start to replace any formula supplements.Relactation—a second chance at breastfeedingIt can be easy to stop breastfeeding, even if things are going fairly well. Many mothers struggle to establish breastfeeding because of difficult circumstances such as lack of access to accurate information and/or lack of support. They end up stopping breastfeeding, but then might regret their decision.Vicky’s storyAn induced birth and separation led to feeding difficulties and Toby losing too much weight. He had to be treated for jaundice and was later hospitalised with an infection. Vicky started to bottlefeed her baby with infant formula to ensure he started gaining weight. After all she had been through, she felt sad and guilty but also slightly relieved.“Back home we settled into a routine of bottlefeeding, but day by day I became more and more upset by my decision. My baby would turn to me to try to breastfeed and I couldn’t believe that I couldn’t do it. After a week of not breastfeeding I deeply regretted my decision and contacted La Leche League, where I was offered the support and encouragement I needed. At the time I had no idea it was possible to restart breastfeeding once you had given up. I started by putting my baby to the breast as often as possible and before every formula feed.It was only a couple of days before I felt the milk coming in and my breasts started to feel full before feeds. I found I didn’t really have time to express as I was breastfeeding a lot of the time. Some afternoons I spent hours breastfeeding but I didn’t let this worry me and just sat down with a good book or a movie. I continued to supplement with formula, writing down the amount I was giving at each feed and gradually started to reduce it. In fact, as I was reducing the last bit Toby suddenly jumped up in weight so I realised he actually didn’t need the top-ups and I just needed confidence that I had enough milk to feed him.I am so pleased that I made the decision to give it another go. It has been hard work but never a chore. Every day I continue to feed Toby I feel amazed at what I’ve achieved. He’s now four months old and is a big, healthy baby.”From LLLGB’sBreastfeeding Mattersissue number 178.Breastfeeding an adopted babyIt is possible to establish milk production for an adopted baby, even if you have never been pregnant or given birth.Ginny’s story“Carly came to us at 12 weeks. Her foster mother from day two had been lovely to her. She had Carly on infant formula feeds. The first time I put Carly to my breast she happily latched on, even though there was no milk and no supplementer.* Wow! I’d forgotten the strength of a baby’s suck. It didn’t make me sore and soon I was used to it and loved having another baby to nurse.Her big brother (who was home-made) had fully weaned three years before.  My attempts to assemble the supplementer were hopeless for the first day or two. Not that it’s difficult, but I was anxious, so her dad got it ready for me to just hang round my neck. Carly easily did the switch from bottle to breast with supplementer. Pretty soon I noticed her dirty nappies showing breastmilk stools (yellow, runny, sweeter smell) along with the artificial infant milk ones. I soon had a thirst at feeding times and needed a glass of water next to me.Then a couple of weeks or so on I had a go at expressing and saw some drops of real live breastmilk! I knew a lot of theory but still doubted my body’s ability to lactate without childbirth. Nearly three months on, Carly didn’t need any more infant formula than she had at 12 weeks old, so my breasts were making the rest of her requirements. Her skin glowed in that breastmilk way. I really felt like I was her mum.The breastfeeding, along with using a baby carrier lots of the day and keeping her nearby at night, helped me bond. Certainly it wasn’t just as easy and convenient as fully breastfeeding, but it was worth the effort. I shall always be thankful for such a good start to mothering our adopted child.”* Nursing supplementer—a device worn by a mother through which her baby receives other milk whilst nursing at the breast. For more information, seeSupplementation(below) and our page onNursing Supplementers.Milk ProductionDuring pregnancy, hormones cause the milk-making cells and milk ducts in the breast to enlarge and multiply.Colostrum (low volume milk, high in protein and antibodies) is produced from late in pregnancy. After birth, milk is produced and released in response to the baby’s suckling and the hormones prolactin and oxytocin. For a mother who has previously breastfed, stimulating the breasts to produce milk without pregnancy and childbirth is called relactation. If you have never had a baby before, this process is called induced lactation.Milk production depends upon a number of factors, including:• Your baby’s age and willingness to breastfeed effectively.• Frequency of breastfeeding and/or milk expression.• Whether you have ever been pregnant, and how long ago.• Effective treatment of any medical conditions you have, eg thyroid problems or diabetes.• Extent of any previous damage to your chest/breasts/nipples eg surgery, burn or other injury.• Extent of any previous damage to the pituitary gland in your brain (where the necessary hormones are produced).• Reason for any infertility.• Practical and emotional support available to youGetting StartedIt’s possible to induce lactation successfully and increase milk production just by breastfeeding frequently and/or expressing.It can take anything from a few days to a few weeks to be able to express a few drops of milk. You can express as you prepare for the arrival of your baby and/or while you encourage them to the breast. Certain hormonal, herbal, pharmacological and dietary treatments can also help stimulate milk production (seeGalactagoguesbelow).If you are adopting, you can also stimulate breast development and induce lactation using oral contraceptives.www.asklenore.infodescribes various protocols, depending upon how long it will be before you are likely to welcome your new baby into your family. However these methods are not suitable for mothers who can’t take oral contraceptives or are taking medications to suppress oestrogen levels.Medical conditions and breastfeedingIf you have a medical condition and/or are taking any medication, tell your doctor that you are planning to breastfeed. Lactation can affect the management of certain medical conditions. Mothers often find medical conditions improve or are easier to manage while they are lactating. If a medication you are taking is incompatible with breastfeeding or may affect milk production there are usually alternatives. An LLL Leader can research information about any medications you take and about breastfeeding with specific medical conditions.Learning to breastfeedYour baby will probably have already experienced bottlefeeding, and breastfeeding may be a totally new experience for them. They may take to it quickly or need time and patience to get used to this new way of feeding. Mothers have found that even babies older than three or four months can still learn to breastfeed. Breastfeeding may be a new experience for you too so finding good support and information on the basics of breastfeeding, including comfortable positioning and attachment will be invaluable. Check out the Further Reading section below. If you are relactating it may also help to talk to an LLL Leader about why you stopped breastfeeding. If possible attend your local LLL group. You can be sure of support and information, even if you attend while bottlefeeding.Close contact really helpsOffer lots of close contact and carrying, either skin-to-skin or lightly dressed, to help your baby associate close contact with pleasure and comfort. Offering to breastfeed before they are too hungry or when they are sleepy may help them respond instinctively to the sensations of being held at the breast. Breastfeeding, rather than using a dummy, when your baby needs to comfort suck can encourage them to nurse more too.SupplementationAt first you will probably need to supplement some breastfeeds with your expressed breastmilk or infant formula. Alternatives to using a bottle can help your baby with the transition to breastfeeding, depending on his age and previous feeding experiences.Nursing Supplementershas details of how to use supplemental nursing systems. Nursing supplementers are devices worn by a mother through which her baby receives other milk whilst nursing at the breast. For older babies, cups are also an option. There is more information on managing and reducing supplements inMy Baby Needs More Milk.If bottles are usedIf you choose to use a bottle to give supplements, the following tips can help your baby switch to breastfeeding.• A smaller teat hole prevents a baby being overwhelmed with milk; a larger one means he has to suck less strongly.• Hold him in an upright position, using your hand to support his neck and head.• To encourage your baby to open wide, place the teat across his upper and lower lips with the tip at the ridge between the upper lip and nose.• Allow your baby some control. Let him take the bottle teat into his mouth himself. Avoid pushing the teat into his mouth.• Tip the bottle just enough to give a gentle flow so your baby isn’t overwhelmed with milk. As the bottle empties, you’ll need to gradually tip the bottle more and lean your baby back.• Encourage frequent pauses to mimic breastfeeding.• Allow your baby to decide when he has had enough.Different supplementsIf you have expressed breastmilk, give this first, before you give your baby any infant formula supplement. To make the most of your precious milk avoid mixing the two together. Infant formula supplements need to be prepared just before use and according to current safety guidelines (see below). Allow prepared powdered formula to cool to body temperature or below so as to avoid burns. Although expensive, using ready-to-feed formula may be more convenient when you are out and about or at home without help. Concentrated and ready to feed forms of infant formula are less likely to clog nursing supplementer tubing than powdered forms.Monitoring weight gainMonitor your baby’s weight gain and keep a check on his wet and dirty nappies to reassure yourself he is gettingenough milk.Using infant formulaYou will probably need to use infant formula whilst you work to increase your milk production. Powdered infant formula is not a sterile product. To reduce health risks associated with using infant formula, follow carefully theNHS guidelines for preparing formula.Increasing Milk Supply By BreastfeedingBreastfeed oftenIt may take a little patience to get your baby to nurse effectively. If your baby is willing, offer the breast every one to two hours and at least 10–12 times in every 24 hours. Cut out any dummy use and let him breastfeed for comfort as well as food to help stimulate milk production. Be prepared to encourage night-time and frequent evening nursing, as this can be particularly good at increasing milk production. Laid back breastfeeding positions also boost the levels of the hormones that increase your milk. A soft carrier or sling can be a handy way of keeping your baby close and encouraging breastfeeding.Start and finish at the breastBabies expect fast flowing milk at the start of a feed when they are thirsty. So: 1. Breastfeed first from both breasts, using breast compression (see box below) to encourage flow, until your baby begins to fuss. 2. Offer a supplement until he is not quite satisfied. 3. Then finish the feed at the breast, using breast compression again. This can work well even if you need to give larger amounts of supplement. If your milk production is very low you can start feeds at step 2 until it increases a little.Try breast compressionThis technique can encourage a baby to breastfeed actively and take more milk.1. Support your breast with one hand—thumb on one side, fingers on the other.2. Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, his jaw moving all the way to his ear. When he stops swallowing, compress your breast firmly to increase milk flow and prompt swallowing. Hold it squeezed while he continues nursing actively then release your hand.3. Rotate your hand around the breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast.Go gently—this should not hurt. Experiment to find what works best for you. Try switching breasts at least two or three times during each feed—when he comes off the first breast on his own, or when breast compression no longer keeps him breastfeeding actively. With time, your baby will need less and less breast compression to keep him actively nursing, until you will find that you no longer need to do this.A deep, comfortable latchAttention to positioning and attachment will help ensure your baby is feeding effectively. You can try experimentingwith different feeding positions. Many mothers find laid back or Biological Nurturing™ a good way of encouraging a baby to nurse really well. Many babies instinctively seek the breast and attach deeply and comfortably if they can snuggle up close to their mother’s chest for periods of time.Try letting your baby lie on your body, skin-toskin or lightly dressed, as you recline so both his chest and tummy are against you.As your body supports your baby, this leaves your hands free to help with latch on. SeePositioning & Attachmentfor more information.Some babies who are accustomed to taking adummyor supplements from a bottle may not take a big enough mouthful of breast and might need to be coached to get a wide enough mouth. Try opening your own mouth very wide and encouraging your baby to look at and imitate you. If you can’t get comfortablespeak to an LLL Leaderwho can give you further suggestions.Take a ‘baby moon’Get some help with household jobs, ignore the dust and eat simple, easily prepared meals for a week or two so you can concentrate on breastfeeding your baby. A couple of days’ bed rest together with your baby can really boost your milk production. Even if you can’t manage this, do plan some time each day to sit or lie down with your baby.Positive signsSigns that your milk is increasing include:• Hormonal changes, such as a brief slump in mood before your milk appears.• Breasts feeling hotter, tingling, fuller or heavier.• Feeling thirsty when breastfeeding.• Leaking milk and/or being able to express more milk.• Your baby gains weight and produces more wet and dirty nappies, especially yellow, mustard-coloured poos.• Your baby starts to refuse supplements.When a baby is reluctant to breastfeedSome babies don’t take to breastfeeding straight away. It can be enormously frustrating if he refuses but patience and gentle persistence can work wonders.Ideas to try• Offer close contact skin-to-skin or lightly dressed for sustained periods of time each day even if your baby is reluctant to latch on at all.• Letting your baby doze on your chest in Biological Nurturing™ or laid-back positions may prompt him to seek out the breast instinctively. Bathing and sleeping together can also have the same effect.• Express a little milk to stimulate your let-down so your milk flows as soon as he latches on.• Or offer a little supplement to take the edge off his hunger and help calm him before you attempt to breastfeed.• If he will latch on, use breast compression to help maintain your milk flow. You can switch sides to maintain his interest too.For more ideas seeMy Baby Won’t BreastfeedandNipple Confusion?Keeping calmEncouraging a reluctant baby to nurse can become stressful. Try to keep calm and avoid conveying anxiety to your baby. Some mothers find relaxation exercises helpful. It’s quite possible that, once your baby is comfortable and relaxed with the closeness, he may latch on when you least expect it, especially if you are expressing to increase your milk production. And even if he doesn’t, you will still have pleasant memories of times spent in close contact together. Remember that you are spending time expressing as well as feeding and caring for your baby. You are doing far more than a mother who is simply bottlefeeding or breastfeeding alone. Be gentle on yourself and take time to meet your own needs for food and rest.Moving away from supplementsWhile your baby is slow to gain weight or not breastfeeding well, keep offering the same amount of supplement. If you get to a point when you are expressing enough milk each day to meet your baby’s needs then you can encourage your baby to get all his milk at your breast instead and gradually cut out the expressed milk supplements. Offer frequent feeds making sure he is latched on well, and use breast compression to help maintain milk flow if his suckling slows or stops. Switching sides several times during a feed can help maintain his interest in nursing and maximise the amount of milk he takes.Reduce supplements graduallyOnce he is nursing and gaining weight steadily, and you are producing more milk, you can start reducing supplements gradually.• Reduce the amount of supplement every few days so your baby continues to get plenty of milk.• It’s best to reduce all or several of the day’s supplements by very small amounts, about 5–15ml for each one.• At times of the day when you feel as though you have more milk, for example, in the morning, you may be able to reduce a supplement by 20–30ml.• Keep an eye on your baby’s wet and dirty nappies so you know that he’s taking plenty of milk.• Keep in touch with your health visitor or GP for regular weighing, and to discuss reducing supplements. Be prepared to take things more slowly if your baby becomes fussy or seems hungry. You may need to slow or temporarily stop reducing supplements.Expressing breastmilkBefore your baby is breastfeedingThe more frequently you express, the more milk you are likely to make. Express at least 8 times each 24 hours,including once during the night if possible. Try to establish a routine you can sustain on a day-to-day basis, and fit in extra sessions on days when you have more time. Milk you express before your adopted baby arrives can be frozen for later use. Even a little breastmilk, however small, is beneficial for a baby. An actively nursing baby is more effective at stimulating milk production than any pump, so you can continue to work to induce and increase your milk supply once your baby arrives and/or is breastfeeding.In addition to breastfeedingYou can express between feeds to stimulate milk production if your baby is reluctant to take the breast or is sleepy and not feeding effectively. You can also express after breastfeeds (either immediately or after a short break) to help stimulate milk production. Expressing even small amounts after feeding boosts milk production. You can give any milk you express as a supplement before you give formula.If your baby will go to the breast frequently, breastfeeding really is the best way of increasing your milk.Expressing milk is an extra, to give your milk production a boost. Mothers who breastfeed frequently (10–12 times a day or more) and don’t have the time to express any milk often increase their milk and establish breastfeeding fastest. Don’t be surprised if you don’t notice any increase in the amount of milk you can express. If you are nursing your baby frequently, he will take the extra milk directly at the breast without you realising.Hand expressionHand expression is very effective, especially for mothers producing small amounts of milk. The skin contact helps stimulate milk flow. Hand expression also works well when combined with pumping. Use it to stimulate your milk flow before pumping, to maintain flow whilst you are actually pumping and/or after pumping to express milk the pump has not reached.PumpingHospital-grade pumps are considered the most effective for mothers needing to induce or increase their milk supply. Pumping both breasts at the same time saves time, stimulates milk production and boosts milk-producing hormones better than single pumping. When pumping one breast at a time, try switching back and forth between breasts as your milk flow slows. Sterilise equipment once a day if your baby is healthy. Just like your milk, pumping equipment can safely be left at room temperature for short periods and refrigerated in a clean container for longer periods, giving you more time for your baby. SeeStoring Your Milkfor details.Making time to expressIt can help to think of expressing time as an enjoyable break to have with a drink, snack or treat. Put your feet up and listen to, watch or read something you enjoy. Find something that makes you relax and smile. The less you think about the process, the more you may be able to express.Try expressing your milk:• In the evening if your baby sleeps—to ‘put in an order’ for more milk tomorrow.• During or after skin-to-skin contact.• Little and often—as frequently as you can manage.More information aboutexpressing your milk.GalactogoguesMedicinal herbs such as fenugreek or prescription medications such as domperidone can increase milk production in conjunction with breast stimulation.Galactogogues are effective only when combined with frequent nursing or expressingto ensure breasts are kept well drained.Many mothers can increase their milk by nursing and expressing alone and don’t need galactogogues. Galactogogues can have side effects. They also need to be taken regularly and in sufficient doses. Even then, not all mothers respond to them. Milk production can drop if you suddenly stop taking a galactogogue so it’s best to cut back gradually and only once you feel confident you are producing more milk than your baby currently needs.FenugreekTake three 500mg capsules, three times a day (nine per day in total). It takes 24–72 hours to see an increase in milk production. Possible side effects include perspiring more profusely and sweat and urine smelling like maple syrup. A few mothers have developed diarrhoea and a few mothers with asthma have reported aggravation of their symptoms. Two cases of fenugreek allergy have been reported (fenugreek is closely related to peanuts). Be cautious if you have diabetes, since fenugreek lowers blood sugar. If you develop any worrying symptoms, stop taking fenugreek and consult your doctor if necessary.DomperidoneYou will need a prescription from your GP. The dose usually recommended is one or two 10mg tablets three times a day. Domperidone is not licensed for use as a galactogogue.FromUK Medicines Information(document will download for viewing):‘As there are limited alternative options for the stimulation of lactation, the use of domperidone can be considered provided there is evidence of thorough evaluation for treatable causes such as poor attachment, and when increased frequency of breastfeeding, pumping or hand expression of milk has not been successful. A maternal dose of 30mg daily for a maximum of 1 week should not be exceeded.Domperidone should not be used if the mother or infant:have conditions where the cardiac conduction is, or could be, impairedhave underlying cardiac diseases such as congestive heart failureare receiving other medications known to prolong QT or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g. ketoconazole or erythromycin. If this is the case, metoclopramide is the preferred alternative.have severe hepatic impairment’Define your own successRelactation or adoptive breastfeeding can be a big commitment. Some mothers consider it but decide it is not for them. Whether or not you choose to go ahead with it, just knowing that it is a possibility can help you come to terms with what you have experienced and to feel in control.Relactation or adoptive breastfeeding is probably best entered into with equal measures of optimism and realism. You might find it helpful to define your own level of success in what you aim to achieve. You may be able to bring in a full milk supply, but even small amounts of breastmilk are beneficial. If your main purpose is to enjoy the closeness of breastfeeding, you can aim to nurse for comfort whenever possible and use a nursing supplementer for feeds. Any breastmilk you produce is a bonus for your baby.Maintaining Milk ProductionEvery drop of breastmilk counts To maintain milk production as long as possible while supplementing with formula:• Breastfeed often and as long at each feed as your baby is willing to, including nursing for comfort between feeds.• Avoid going longer than eight hours without breastfeeding or expressing.• Use breast compression to maximise the milk your baby receives each time he goes to the breast, and to help keep your breasts well drained.• Give formula only after he has nursed. • Offer the breast again if he is willing after taking a formula supplement.• Whilst your baby’s weight gain is steady, avoid increasing the amount of formula he receives.MenstruationSome mothers find their milk production drops temporarily just before or when they are menstruating. If you continue to breastfeed and/or pump, milk production will increase in a few days.Out at work?You could:• Compensate for lack of daytime nursing by encouraging some night-time nursing.• Make extra efforts to increase your milk on days when you are off work. As your milk production increases, or after days at home, your breasts may feel fuller. Be prepared to express milk while at work to keep comfortable, to prevent engorgement and to reduce the risk of mastitis.There may come a point when you decide to stop because establishing breastfeeding isn’t working out. Pumping to keep up milk production takes a lot of time and is not a long-term option for many mothers when a baby doesn’t take to the breast easily. But whatever happens, be proud because every single drop of breastmilk you have given your baby will have been beneficial. You know that you did everything possible to make breastfeeding an option. If you have another baby, don’t hesitate to get in touch with La Leche League again. Making contact with LLL before your baby arrives means you can share your concerns and gather information to help avoid problems. Knowing who to contact means you’ll be able to get help quickly to prevent any minor problems in those early weeks from escalating.Support networkLLL groupsare a great source of support for all mothers who are working to establish breastfeeding, whatever their circumstances. If you plan to adopt or have a baby born by surrogacy, you can attend LLL meetings before your baby arrives just like other expectant mothers.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone, and mothers of LLLGBFurther ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Positioning & Attachment,https://laleche.org.uk/positioning-attachment/,"Getting your baby positioned and attached comfortably at the breast is an art—mothers often say it takes a little while for breastfeeding to feel entirely comfortable and natural, even if they’ve breastfed before. In the past girls grew up learning about breastfeeding by watching mothers in their families and communities. These days many of us become mothers having never seen a baby breastfeed.But breastfeeding has worked for mothers and babies for thousands of years and it can work for you too.Many babies can find their way to the breast by themselves, especially if they haven’t been too affected by birth interventions. Other mums and babies need a little longer to work it out with maybe some help from a skilled breastfeeding supporter such as anLLL Leader.When all is going well, specific holds and positions don’t really matter because you and your baby will work out what suits you best. However if you are finding it awkward, uncomfortable or downright painful then the following information is designed to help you think about where you can make adjustments and get breastfeeding working comfortably for you.Good positioning and attachment is important for maintaining milk production.A baby who attaches deeply at the breast is able to remove milk effectively.This is important for maintaining milk production. Well-drained breasts make milk quickly. If there is any concern about how much milk you are making, working on improving positioning and attachment is an important first step.There’s no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’.If you are comfortable, your baby is producing plenty of dirty nappies and is gaining weight after the first few days, then breastfeeding is going well for you. There are no rules—but there are a few principles that can help you work out what to do if things aren’t going well: seeLatching on – getting a good attachment.Positioningdescribes how you sit or lie and how you support your baby as he takes the breast. How you hold your baby can make a big difference to how well he can breastfeed. Even small adjustments can be significant.Attachmentdescribes the way he latches onto the breast.Tips for getting startedThe laid-back approachLatching on – getting a good attachmentDifferent breastfeeding positionsAs time goes byTips for getting startedIf it hurts then make changesIf it doesn’t feel right to you, then it isn’t fine, whatever anyone says. Pain is your body’s way of letting you know something is wrong. Start by trying to improve positioning and attachment. A few quick adjustments to how you are sitting or lying or how your baby comes towards the breast may be all that are needed.Sometimes it can take a little longer. You may need to work with one or more skilled breastfeeding supporters over a period of time to get to the point where everything falls into place and breastfeeding starts feeling natural.Each mother and baby pair is different and what works well for one mother and baby may not work for you. This is one reason why you may hear different suggestions from different helpers. You are the best judge of what is helpful so don’t be afraid to use what feels right for you and discard the rest.Your baby needs to be calmYou can offer the breast at any time when you are both calm. You may even find it easier if your baby isn’t obviously hungry. Feed your baby before he needs to cry. Early cues for wanting to eat include suckingtheir hand, smacking their lips, turning their head towards you, or fussing. They won’t latch well if they are distressed. If your baby is upset take time to soothe them. Hold them upright against you, stroke them and talk to them. A little expressed colostrum or breastmilk given on a spoon can help to calm them if they are desperately hungry.Your baby needs full body contactWhen your baby is held in full body contact against you, they will feel stable and be better able to coordinate their movements. Laid back positions ensure full body contact. If you’re sitting up, you’ll need to hug your baby in as tightly as if you were standing up holding them against you. Babies who don’t feel stable tend to wave their arms around, which can make latching more difficult. Pillows can get in the way and aren’t always necessary. So wait until after your baby’s latched on, and then tuck them in only if you need them for support.Some babies need timeSome babies find it difficult to latch on, or simply nurse ineffectively at the breast. Often a difficult birth or interventions during labour or birth are the cause. Giving a baby time to recover, and using laid-back breastfeeding positions  withskin-to-skin contactcan maximise your baby’s natural instinct to breastfeed. If your baby isn’t latching or feeding well seek help from an LLL Leader and read our pageMy Baby Won’t Breastfeed. With time and patience, most babies will breastfeed. In the meantimeexpress your milkfor your baby to maintain milk production and give you both the time to work it out.Laid-back breastfeedingLaid-back breastfeedingMany people assume you have to sit up to breastfeed. Not so. In fact evidence suggests humans evolved to breastfeed in laid-back positions with our babies upright against our chests. You may have experienced this type of position when you had your first feed, soon after your baby’s birth. There is more and more evidence that laid-back breastfeeding positions (also called Biological Nurturing) help babies breastfeed more effectively and are more comfortable for mothers, especially in the early days and weeks.Laid back breastfeeding is really useful for those first few days and weeks when you want to rest and recover and your baby needs to be in close contact with you to get breastfeeding established. It can be done skin-to-skin or with you both lightly dressed. You don’t have to be in bed; the sofa or a reclining chair is a comfortable alternative.You can also use laid-back breastfeeding principles when sitting in an upright chair by shifting your weight back onto your tail bone and reclining your body back a little, to open up a space for your baby. This allows more of their weight to be supported by your body and less by your arms. It isn’t safe to sleep with your baby on a chair or sofa.Sleepy babiesIf your baby issleepy, perhaps because of birth interventions, then using laid-back positions with skin-to-skin contact can encourage your baby’s interest in feeding. In laid-back positions babies often attach and feed when in light sleep so it helps to spend substantial periods of time with your sleepy baby against you. When you notice the little movements that indicate your baby is moving into a light period of sleep you can encourage them to latch.How laid back breastfeeding worksYou lay back in a comfortable, supported semi-reclining position (not flat) that opens up your body, creating space for your baby.Your baby lies against you, their whole front against your body, vertically or at any comfortable angle.Your baby feels stable and secure and their instinctive feeding reflexes are triggered, prompting them to bob their head and seek out the breast.Gravity helps them latch deeply and stay latched, rather than hindering the process.Your hands are free to support and caress your baby and help them attach.Your body releases the hormones that stimulate milk production and make you experience loving feelings towards your baby.There are no rules—you and your baby are free to work it out between yourselves.If you have twins or more, laid-back positions can allow you to feed two babies at once with less need for cushions or helping hands.Latching on — getting a good attachmentYour baby needs to tip their head back and reach forward with their lower jaw. As your baby tips their head back their jaw drops and their mouth opens wide, so they can anchor their chin and lower lip firmly against your breast. If they have to tuck their chin in to reach the nipple they won’t be able to open their mouth so wide. Tipping their head back also makes a deep latch possible, swallowing easier, and frees up their nose for comfortable breathing. In laid-back positions lay your baby with their head between your breasts. If you are sitting up, keep your supporting hand away from the back of their head. Babies tend to creep forward, so try shifting them so that their eyes and nose are opposite the nipple to encourage them to reach forward and anchor their chin first. In sitting or side lying positions a little push between the shoulder blades with your supporting hand or arm as they latch brings their chest in closer and helps their head tip back.Their lower jaw needs a clear space to anchor.Think about how you might take a mouthful from a big sandwich by placing your lower jaw first then opening your mouth to accommodate the top of the sandwich—the principle is the same. Your baby’s lower jaw needs to be deeply placed on your breast well away from the nipple. Keep the fingers of your supporting hand away from the place where their chin and lower jaw need to be so their lower lip and chin can sink into your breast. Your baby’s chin needs to stay firmly in contact with your breast.Your baby needs a big mouthful.When a baby chews on a nipple, this compresses the milk ducts, prevents milk flowing and hurts. When a baby has a good big mouthful of breast beyond the nipple, breastfeeding is comfortable and milk can flow. Some women like (or need) to hold their breast when nursing. They flatten their breast as they would a big sandwich they were offering to the baby, matching it to the oval of his mouth. This can help their baby grasp more breast tissue. It doesn’t matter if fingers are closer to the upper jaw but try to keep the “lower jaw fingers” out of your baby’s way. Biological Nurturing™ positions make use of gravity to help a baby get a bigger mouthful.The exaggerated latch. To get an even deeper latch you could try this optional extra. Place your thumb or finger near the base of the nipple where the middle of your baby’s upper lip will be, lined up with their nose. If you press, your nipple will tilt away from your baby, presenting them with your breast rather than your nipple. Avoid pressing your nipple into their mouth. As they open wide, snuggle them in close and use your thumb or finger to tuck the breast into their mouth. Your nipple will be taken in last and unroll in their mouth. You can then slip your finger out.Our own video below demonstratesflipple technique(aka exaggerated latch), it can be very helpful for getting an effective pain free latch:Let your breast rest at its natural level. It can be tempting to lift your breast and move it towards your baby’s mouth. If you do this, your baby probably won’t get a full mouthful, and after a while your hand will get tired and the breast will drop and slip out of their mouth. Breastfeeding pillows can get in the way too because they lift a baby up too high and prevent you tucking them in against your tummy. See where your breasts naturally rest and hold your baby accordingly. If you need them, tuck pillows in after they are well attached.Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby.Since breasts are attached to you and you baby is moveable it makes much more sense to bring your baby to the breast, not the other way round! And it works better too. With their body tucked firmly against you (or laid on top of your body), your baby will feel more stable and have better head control, and you’ll feel a lot more comfortable too.It’s easier to latch onto a softer breast.It’s much easier to get a deep mouthful if the breast is soft so breastfeed frequently to avoid engorgement. When your baby bobs their head and licks the nipple, it naturally makes it easier to latch on. If your breast is full and hard, you can usereverse pressure softeningto move fluids away from the nipple area so your baby can latch on well. Apply gentle steady pressure with your fingertips on the areola around your nipple for about a minute. You can also press with the sides of your thumbs or fingers. Denting the breast at the edge of the areola with a finger and placing your baby’s chin in the dent may also help. Gently hand express a little milk too if needed.Your baby needs to choose his own timing.Your baby will probably do best if they pick the moment to latch on. You can help by supporting them in a position that lets them do this when they are ready. To encourage your baby to gape hold them close against you, close enough to the breast so they know the nipple is there, but where they can’t quite reach it. Be prepared for your baby to lick and nuzzle for several minutes before they are ready to open wide.The natural or laid-back breastfeeding positions shown in the following videos can be a great help in encouraging your baby to latch on well, as well as being comfortable for you. You can recline comfortably with your baby on top of you with their whole front against you and their body completely supported by yours.Best Beginnings’ video demonstrates clearly how to make sure your baby is attaching well to the breast, you can view ithere.This video fromGlobal Health Mediademonstrates how to enable your baby to latch deeply on to your breast so that breastfeeding is comfortable for you and means your baby get enough milk:This video fromRaising Children.net.aushows how to attach your baby well, and shows a variety of comfortable breastfeeding positions:Using different breastfeeding positionsThe cradle holdAlthough the cradle hold is one of the most common nursing positions it can be a challenge for new mothers to learn. You need to hold your baby’s body firmly against you to give them stability because their weight is supported mainly by your arms. Shifting so you are sitting on your tailbone, rather than upright can help stability and reduce the strain on your arms (see picture right). It can be difficult to control a baby’s head and to keep them high enough and close enough to your breast. A small baby may tend to curl up in a ball in this position if not pulled in closely enough against your body. It may not be the best choice at first if you’re experiencing any problems with latch-on, milk transfer or if you have sore nipples. Once you’re more confident with breastfeeding, you may find you use a version of the cradle hold much of the time, especially when out and about.Tuck your baby’s body firmly against yours.Your baby’s whole front is against your tummy, their hip resting on or near your thigh, tucked around you like a comma. Their chest will be snuggled into the breast and your nipple near their nose.Their head is resting on your forearm and/ or wrist (not the crook of the elbow).As your baby opens their mouth to take the breast, pull their body in firmly against you.Once your baby is attached, settle back a little for your own comfort and so that more of their weight is taken by your body.Laid back breastfeedingRemember that Biological Nurturing™ positions aren’t just for the first week or two. They can be really useful later on when you want to relax, and especially if you are breastfeeding more than one baby or if your baby is fussy or unwell.The cross-cradle holdThe cross-cradle position can be useful in the early days because it gives you more control in guiding your baby to the breast. It can be uncomfortable to maintain without good support under your arms, especially with larger babies, so once your baby is attached, switch arms as shown in the picture below. After the first few weeks and as your baby grows longer and heavier, you may prefer to use other comfortable holds. Avoid touching the top or back of your baby’s head because it often causes a baby to pull back from the breast. Forcing a baby onto the breast by firmly holding the back of the head usually has the opposite effect and can put a baby off breastfeeding.Cross cradleTuck their whole front against your tummy, their hip near or resting on your thigh.Your hand supports their neck (not the back of the head) with your palm between their shoulder blades.Your other hand is free to shape or stabilise your breast if needed.Make sure your baby isn’t too far round the front—line them up so their eyes and nose are near the nipple.As your baby opens their mouth, give a little push with the palm of your hand to bring their chest in close against you.This will help their head tip back and let them plant their chin deeply against your breast.Once your baby is attached you can bring your  other arm round to support your baby’s body and settle back a little for your own comfort and so that more of his weight is taken by your body. Hold your baby with the arm opposite to the breast he’s going to latch onto.The underarm (clutch or rugby) holdThe underarm hold is useful if you have had acaesarean birth. It helps keep the weight of your baby off your incision. It is also a good position for mothers with flat or inverted nipples and for babies with latch-on or sucking problems because it offers you a good view of baby and breast and control of your baby’s head. You can also feedtwo babies at oncein this position. For larger, longer babies you may need extra cushions behind your back to bring you further forward and allow space for your baby’s length.Your baby’s front is close against your side, with your hand under their shoulders and neck.Your elbow keeps them tucked closely against your body.Your baby approaches your breast from below. This can work well if you have large breasts. If you have smaller breasts you may need to bring your baby into a semi-sitting position.Make sure your baby isn’t too far round the front. You may need a cushion between your back and the chair back to allow room for your baby’s length and prevent them pushing themselves forward with his feet.Side lyingThis side-lying position is helpful if you are recovering from a caesarean birth or an episiotomy and invaluable for nursing in bed during the night.It can take a while to get the knack but it’s well worth persisting because it can make night feeds so much easier.Some mothers decide to sleep with their baby alongside them. Others choose to move their baby back onto a separate sleep surface.Safe Sleep and the Breastfed Babywill help you decide on the safest sleep arrangements for your family, based on your own individual circumstances.• Lie on your side, with your knees bent up and a pillow under your head.• Place your baby on their side facing you so that their body and your body form a V-shape, meeting at your hips, with your nipple level with their nose or eyes.• You can put your arm under your baby’s head as shown, or up by the pillow with your baby lying on the bed.• As your baby latches, give a little push between their shoulder blades to bring their chest in closer and help their head to tip back and their mouth toopen wide.• You may find it helpful to tuck a small pillow or rolled blanket behind the small of your back and/or between your knees.Standing upAt some feeds babies just do better if you stand up. You can sway or bounce gently to help calm your baby, and the lack of a lap can be helpful. As always keep your baby nice and stable and let them lead the way. Try angling their legs down instead of holding them horizontal, and see what happens. Or try starting with them against your shoulder, supporting them as he moves down to the breast. Even when using other positions, sometimes just standing up and sitting down again straight away helps everything settle into a comfortable position.As time goes byWhether you choose to breastfeed sitting up, reclining or lying on your side, you will need to adjust how you support your baby as he grows in length and weight. Use the principles shown here as you experiment with different positions. Sometimes there are physical or medical causes for pain or discomfort such as tongue tie or a thrush infection. If you are still finding it difficult to get comfortable, do persist with seeking further and continued support. There is almost always a breastfeeding solution to breastfeeding problems.

Sharing Breastmilk,https://laleche.org.uk/sharing-breastmilk/,"LLL is aware that throughout time mothers in many cultures have informally shared their breastmilk and wet nursed among family members and trusted friends. We know that in times of severe maternal illness, death and natural disaster sharing breastmilk can be lifesaving.The World Health Organisation states that if a mother’s own milk is not available then the next best thing is the milk of another woman (1). La Leche League fully supports the use of human milk for babies. We aim to help mothers breastfeed their babies; we also seek to help mothers express and safely store their own milk for their babies. When mothers can’t provide sufficient breast milk themselves we provide information and support to help them find a safe alternative.Can I increase my own supply?Some techniques to try:Increase frequency of nursingmake sure the baby is latched on correctlyoffer both breasts at each feedingYou might also find useful information on our pageIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?and inFurther Reading.In rare circumstances mothers are unable to provide their baby with a full supply of breast milk. Human milk banks provides pasteurised, screened donor milk, which is a good alternative.There are documented benefits and risks to informal milk sharing. Benefits of breast milk include, but are not limited to:optimal nutritioneasy digestibilityimmunological protectionRisks of sharing breast milk can include, but are not limited to:transmission of certain infectious agents, like bacteria or viruses, some of which may be found in milk expressed by asymptomatic womenmedicines and other drugsenvironmental contaminants as a result of unhygienic storage and handling of unprocessed donated milkLLLGB suggests that mothers who wish to obtain breast milk contact licensed human milk banks, or another regulated and medically supervised human milk collection centre.Licensed milk banks require donors to meet specific health requirements before accepting their donated milk. The milk is screened and treated for viruses to eliminate undetected infections it might contain.Women who wish to donate their breastmilk to others can request complete information from a milk bank about how her milk will be used, and she may be able to restrict how it will be used.An LLL Leader may providecontact informationfor non-profit human milk banks, other regulated collection centers, and formal/medically supervised or informal milk-sharing networks but cannot set up or facilitate any type of milk-sharing network.Further ReadingIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Amazing MilkBeginning BreastfeedingNursing SupplementersExpressing Your MilkStoring Your MilkLLLI information and policy on milk sharingIn Praise of at-breast supplementers– a mother’s story  from Breastfeeding MattersOther websitesHuman Milk for Human Babies (HM4HB), theInformed milksharing networkReferencesWHO Infant and Young Child Nutrition[1]http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA55/ea5515.pdfWritten by Anna Burbidge"
Alcohol & breastfeeding (quick read),https://laleche.org.uk/alcohol-drink/,"The effects of alcohol on your baby are directly related to the amount you drink. When you drink occasionally the amount of alcohol your baby receives has not been proven to be harmful.Things to considerDo I need to pump and dump?Can alcohol affect milk supply?Do I have to pump and dump after drinking alcohol?Alcohol abuse affects the babyLa Leche League International’s Health Advisory CouncilSummaryThings to considerYour baby’s ageA newborn has an immature liver, and will be more affected by alcoholUp until around 3 months of age, infants metabolise alcohol at about half the rate of adultsAn older baby can metabolise alcohol more quickly than a young infantThink about the following:your weight: the heavier you are the more quickly you can metabolise alcoholthe amount you are drinking: the effect of alcohol on the baby is directly related to the amount of alcohol that is consumedWill you be eating? An alcoholic drink consumed with food decreases the absorption rate into the bloodstreamDo I need to pump and dump?Alcohol is present in a woman’s milk at the same level as in her blood. It passes freely into breastmilk and peaks about 30 to 60 minutes after drinking, 60 to 90 minutes when drunk with food.You do not have to pump and dump after drinking alcohol when you’re breastfeeding, except for comfort.As alcohol leaves your bloodstream, it leaves your breastmilk. Alcohol is not “trapped” in breastmilk and pumping and dumping will not remove it. Drinking a lot of water, resting, or drinking coffee will not speed up the rate at which alcohol leaves your body.Can alcohol affect milk supply?Studies have found that babies nurse more frequently when their mother has consumed alcohol. Although letdown is inhibited and milk intake temporarily reduced after a mother has drunk alcohol, babies may compensate by feeding more frequently in the hours after a mother has had a drink.Alcohol abuse affects the babyMaternal blood alcohol levels must attain 300 mg/100ml before significant side effects are reported in the infant.  (80mg/100ml fails the police breath test). If a mother is regularly consuming large amounts of alcohol this could harm the baby. It would be a good idea for a woman to consult a health professional if she has any doubts about the compatibility of her drinking habits with breastfeeding.If you are sober enough to drive you should be sober enough to breastfeed.If consumed in large amounts alcohol can cause drowsiness, deep sleep, weakness, and abnormal weight gain in the infant, and the possibility of decreased milk-ejection reflex in the mother. Mothers who have been drinkingshould not bed-sharewith their babies as their natural reflexes will be affected.La Leche League International’s Health Advisory CouncilDr. Jack Newman MD, FRCPC and Thomas W. Hale, R.Ph. Ph.D, both members of La Leche League International’s Health Advisory Council believe that a mother can drink some alcohol and continue breastfeeding as she normally does. See further reading for more information .SummaryIf you want to drink but are concerned about the effect on your baby, you can use expressed breastmilk.  Alternatively you can wait for the alcohol to clear from your system (about two hours for each drink consumed).  If you become uncomfortable while waiting you can express and discard your milk.Further ReadingSafe sleep and the breastfed babyRead a longer version of this articlehere.NHS guidanceAlcohol while breastfeedingLLLI articlesAlcohol and breastfeedingCopyright LLLGB 2016"
Tongue Tie,https://laleche.org.uk/tongue-tie/,"Are you experiencing pain while breastfeeding, possibly combined with slow weight gain for your baby? While the vast majority of such breastfeeding problems can be resolved by adjusting positioning and attachment, and with good breastfeeding management, occasionally tongue tie might be the cause of the problem.Tongue tie (ankyloglossia) is caused by a tight or short lingual frenulum (the membrane that anchors the tongue to the floor of the mouth). The frenulum normally thins and recedes before birth. Where this doesn’t happen, the frenulum may restrict tongue mobility. Tongue tie often runs in families and is thought to be more common in boys than girls. There is an association between high or unusual palates and tongue tie, because restricted tongue movement can affect the shape of the palate.Breastfeeding challenges can also occur for other reasons. Identifying the cause is important when deciding on appropriate solutions, so seek help from someone skilled.Identifying tongue tieWhen your baby tries to lift their tongue or move it forwards it may appear misshapen, short or heart-shaped, with the frenulum clearly pulling its centre down and restricting its movement. Or you may be able to see or feel firm tissue where their tongue meets the floor of his mouth. Degrees of tongue tie vary and it can be difficult to diagnose accurately. A short, tight, posterior tongue tie is rarer, but may be particularly hard to spot.How breastfeeding may be affectedTongue tie affects tongue movement to varying degrees. The shorter and tighter it is, the more likely it is to affect breastfeeding. Some babies with a tongue tie breastfeed well from the start, others do so when positioning and attachment are improved. But any tongue tie that restricts normal tongue movement can lead to breastfeeding difficulties. A baby needs to be able to move their tongue freely and extend it over the lower gum with their mouth open wide to be able to breastfeed well. The symptoms below are all associated with poor attachment that may be caused by tongue tie.A baby may:• Be unable to latch on to the breast at all.• Be unable to latch on deeply, causing nipple pain and damage.• Have difficulties staying on the breast, making a clicking sound as he loses suction.• Splutter and choke when coping with fast flowing milk.• Breastfeed constantly to get enough milk.• Have poor weight gain or need supplementation to maintain adequate weight gain.• Develop jaundice that needs treating.• Be fussy at the breast when the milk flow slows.• Develop colic.A mother may experience:• Pain during feeds, with damaged nipples. Her nipple may be compressed or distorted into a wedge shape like that of a new lipstick immediately after feeding, often with a stripe at its tip.• Engorgement, blocked ducts and mastitis because of ineffective milk removal.• Low milk production because of ineffective milk removal.• Oversupply—if her baby compensates for not being able to breastfeed well by nursing very frequently.• Tiredness, frustration and discouragement.• A premature end to breastfeeding.Breastfeeding is important for every babyThough sometimes needed as a temporary supplement if your milk production is very low, introducing infant formula is not the answer. It has short-term and long-term health risks for both your baby and you. A baby with tongue tie can also have difficulties with bottlefeeding. Milk may leak from his mouth during feeds and he may suffer from colic.TreatmentWhere a tongue tie is causing breastfeeding problems, treatment options are available and effective— especially if the treatment is prompt. Although attention to positioning and attachment can help maintain breastfeeding and improve comfort to a certain extent, there is evidence that treating tongue tie by frenotomy (see below) is effective in resolving breastfeeding difficulties. Weight gain can improve dramatically. As well as the continued breastfeeding benefits, continuing to breastfeed after frenotomy maximises a baby’s chance of normal mouth (palate), speech and dental development. This includes tongue mobility for licking and moving particles of food around the mouth, helping prevent tooth decay.Keeping breastfeeding goingMastering the art of breastfeeding can sometimes be a challenge and it takes determination to keep going if you are in pain. The information here can help you keep breastfeeding, both before and after treatment.Soften your breastA baby with tongue tie may find it easier to latch on if your breast is soft so breastfeed frequently to avoid engorgement. When your baby bobs their head and licks the nipple, they naturally makes it easier to latch on. Or you can use reverse pressure softening to move fluids away from the nipple area so your baby can latch on well. Press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple. Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola. You can also press with the sides of your fingers. Place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be. Gently hand express a little milk if needed.Biological nurturing™A baby often instinctively attaches more deeply and comfortably if they can snuggle up close to their mother’s chest for periods of time. Try letting your baby lie on your body as you recline so both their chest and tummy are against you. This kind of ‘laid-back’ breastfeeding contact is known as Biological Nurturing™ and can be done skin-to-skin or with you and your baby lightly clothed—whatever is more comfortable and convenient for you both. Because gravity helps a baby keep their tongue forwards, this can make a real difference to how well your baby feeds and how much milk you make. See picture above and Online Information section for details of an online video.A deeper latchHelp your baby get as deep a latch as possible at the breast. This will maximise the amount of milk they get and minimise nipple pain.If your baby retracts (pulls back) their tongue when they open their mouth, try sliding their chin a little further from the nipple so he can feel the ‘fatter’ part of the breast with his tongue. Denting the breast at the edge of the areola with a finger and placing your baby’s chin in the dent may also help.You could also try placing your thumb or finger near the base of the nipple where your baby’s upper lip will be. If you press, your nipple will tilt away from your baby, presenting them with your breast rather than your nipple. As they open wide, snuggle them in close and use your thumb or finger to tuck the breast into their mouth. Your nipple will be taken in last and unroll in their mouth. If needed, you can then slip your finger out. An LLL Leader can give you further suggestions to help you improve your baby’s positioning and attachmentEncourage tongue mobilityTo encourage your baby to move their tongue forward, you can also try:• Reclining with your baby on top of you. Try leaning forward and back yourself to understand how gravity affects tongue position.• Encouraging them to lick milk from their lips or from your nipple before and after feeds.• Sticking your tongue out at your baby to encourage them to copy you.Maintain milk productionIf your baby is sleepy or has jaundice, or if you have engorgement or inverted nipples, then a tongue tie can make things worse. If they are not able to take enough milk directly at the breast then you will need to express it and give it to your baby until they are able to breastfeed effectively. Express by hand and/or with a pump at least 8 times a day if your baby is not draining the breast well. This will maintain your milk production and ensure they get enough milk.Small amounts of expressed milk can be offered by spoon, cup or syringe while you both learn how to breastfeed. Bottles or dummies can confuse your baby’s sucking technique so consult an LLL Leader about breastfeeding friendly ways to bottlefeed or about using a nursing supplementer. This device delivers extra milk through a tube along your breast as your baby nurses, avoiding the need for bottles.An unusual palateRestricted tongue movement caused by tongue tie may affect the shape of a baby’s palate, leading to a high palate or a bubble palate with a high spot. These may be a factor in broken suction, a clicking sound and pain during breastfeeding. A baby with an unusual palate may also resist a deeper latch due to gagging.The following may help.• Start with a clean finger with closely trimmed nail.• Touch your baby’s lips and wait until they open their mouth.• Gently slide in your finger, pad side up along his hard palate, stopping just before the gag reflex is triggered.Make this a pleasant game and, over a few days, gradually move your finger back to overcome sensitivity. After a tongue tie is divided, a baby’s increased tongue movement helps the palate shape become more normalTreating Tongue TieWhat can be done?Frenotomy—dividing the tongue tie—can dramatically improve breastfeeding comfort and efficiency for both mother and baby. Dividing a tongue tie is a quick and simple procedure. No anaesthetic is needed for a baby under six months of age.There are health professionals around the UK who have been specifically trained to divide tongue ties. For treatment on the NHS, you will need a referral from your midwife, health visitor or GP. Knowledge about tongue ties and how they affect breastfeeding varies, so it is worth persisting and seeking a second opinion. In areas where only GPs can refer, your midwife or health visitor may be able to give a recommendation to your GP or suggest seeing a particular GP. Private treatment may also be an option.  SeeFurther Readingfor information on finding a practitioner trained to divide tongue tiesIs waiting an option?Sometimes a very thin tongue tie breaks spontaneously or can be stretched by gentle massage of the frenulum. The earlier a tongue tie is divided, the easier it is to resolve any breastfeeding difficulties. Dividing a tongue tie in a baby over six months old is also a more complicated procedure and usually requires a general anaesthetic.Frenotomy—what will happen?After the health professional’s initial assessment, your baby will be swaddled and held (often by an assistant) so they stay still during the procedure, which only takes a minute or two. The health professional lifts the tongue and divides the frenulum by cutting it with a pair of round-ended sterile scissors or by cauterising it.Does it hurt?No anaesthetic is needed for a very young baby as having a tongue tie divided only hurts a little, if at all. Some babies protest more at being swaddled than about the treatment. Others sleep right through the procedure! You will be asked to breastfeed your baby as soon as the procedure is over, to offer comfort, clean the wound and get their tongue moving as soon as possible. The inside of a baby’s mouth heals very quickly. The only treatment usually needed is to breastfeed to keep the wound clean and keep his tongue mobile. There may be a white patch under your baby’s tongue, but this heals within 24 to 48 hours.If things don’t resolveUsually a mother notices an instant improvement in her comfort during breastfeeds. Sometimes it takes a week or two for a baby to adjust to their tongue’s greater mobility. An older baby may find it harder to adjust to increased tongue mobility and tongue exercises may be recommended. Occasionally a baby’s frenulum needs dividing a second time, usually because the division was not quite extensive enough the first time. If you suspect that the initial procedure has not resolved your baby’s breastfeeding problems arrange another consultation. Do persist with finding solutions. If several factors are involved it can take time and expertise to resolve the problem. An LLL Leader can suggest further paths to explore and provide ongoing support.Painful nipplesUsing different feeding positions can help if breastfeeding is painful. Or use the position you find most comfortable until your nipples heal. Check your baby’s attachment later in the feed—if they slip down your nipple, this may cause you pain. Reclining breastfeeding positions or extra support under your arms may help.Ask your LLL Leader aboutbreast compression,which can help your baby get more milk quicker. An increase in milk flow may also help them breastfeed more effectively.Hand expressto stimulate milk flowbefore feeding. Or start on the least painful side, switching sides once your milk lets down. Pain can reduce milk flow, leading to engorgement and mastitis. Ask your doctor, midwife or health visitor about using a suitable painkiller. Applying warmth and using gentle massage and relaxation exercises just before feeds can help milk to flow.Moist wound healingWhen the underlying problem is corrected, moist wound healing can help your nipples heal without scab formation. After each feed gently pat your nipples dry to remove surface wetness. Apply a tiny smear of ultra pure modified lanolin to each nipple, dabbing it on rather than rubbing. Hydrogel pads without a cloth backing can also be used.Blood from cracked nipplesBlood from cracked nipples is not harmful to your baby. You can continue to breastfeed whilst working to improve positioning and attachment.If healing is slowOnce your baby starts latching on well you should feel more comfortable and notice signs of healing within a few days. If not, visit your GP—sometimes a bacterial or fungal infection can prevent healing. Continued pain may be a sign that treatment (or further treatment) of your baby’s tongue tie is needed.Seek supportThis is a time when the support of other mothers in your local LLL group can be invaluable.
