My Baby Won’t Breastfeed,https://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-wont-breastfeed/,"This page is about young babies who have never breastfed or who get very upset when offered the breast. If your baby was breastfeeding well but is now refusing, see our page on “nursing strikes”. Sometimes, a new difficulty with feeding is the first sign that the baby is becoming unwell. If you are not sure that your baby is well, please contact your doctor.When a baby doesn’t breastfeed after birth, it can be upsetting, confusing and frustrating. You might wonder whether you’re doing something wrong, or even whether your baby likes you. It’s hard not to take it personally!Babies are ‘hardwired’ to breastfeed – it is an essential survival behaviour. When a baby doesn’t breastfeed, it’s never because they don’t want to. Something is making it hard for them. Babies are never “lazy” or “difficult” – they always do the best they can. So do their mothers!When it’s taking time for breastfeeding to get going:Keep your milk flowingKeep your baby fedKeep your baby closeIf you do this, your baby is very likely to breastfeed when they are ready. Time, patience, and good feeding support are usually all you need.This useful summary of the “3 Keeps” can be downloaded as a free A4 posterhere.You can read more about getting breastfeeding on track after a difficult starthere.Why isn’t my baby breastfeeding?After a straightforward birth, most well, full-term babies will start feeding within an hour or so. Not all babies have such an easy start, though. Babies can take longer to start breastfeeding if:They had amore complicated birth. Babies born with the aid of forceps, for example, often take a few days to recover and feed well.  If you had pain medication in labour, your baby may be sleepy and uncoordinated at first.Your baby wasborn early, or smallfor their gestational age. See alsobreastfeeding premature babiesandlate preterm babies(those born between 34 and 37 weeks). Even being born one or two weeks early can mean that your baby takes longer to start breastfeeding. It might take until around your baby’s due date, or a little longer, before they are ready to feed well.You and your baby wereseparatedafter birth because one or both of you needed medical care.Your baby is verysleepyand doesn’t yet have enough energy to breastfeed. See alsosleepy babyandnewborn jaundice.Your baby isunwell.Your baby isuncomfortable, e.g., some babies have a sore head or sore shoulder after birth.Your baby haslow muscle tone(hypotonia).Your baby has a physical challenge such astongue-tie.You have plenty of timeParents sometimes worry that if their baby isn’t breastfeeding well, or at all, in the first few hours, days or weeks after birth, it will never happen.  While breastfeeding in the first hour after birth is ideal, the window of opportunity for babies to start breastfeeding is much longer than this.  The feeding reflexes, which keep babies seeking and attaching to the breast, last for at least two to three months after birth.  We have seen many babies start breastfeeding older than three months, too! There are even reports of children over a year old starting to breastfeed, when placed for adoption with a lactating mother. Where there is milk, there is always the possibility of breastfeeding.Photo: Jen ValslerFirst things firstSorting out breastfeeding problems can feel overwhelming.  There seems to be so much to do, and you might feel you have to do it all at the same time!  It is helpful to know what is urgent and what can wait.  This can help you to work out what to do in what order, and how best to use your time and energy. Feeding at the breast is the least urgent thing, at this stage.If your goal is to have a full milk supply (enough milk to meet all your baby’s needs) but you need to use donated breastmilk or formula at the moment, or if your baby is not growing well just on your milk, then making more milk is the top priority. This is more urgent than your baby starting to feed at the breast.If your baby is not breastfeeding at all yet, or is not breastfeeding effectively, you canexpress your milk. This gives you milk to feed your baby now and encourages your breasts to make plenty of milk for the weeks and months to come.Your breasts may temporarily become swollen and uncomfortable, starting around 2-4 days after birth. This is called “engorgement” and is a sign that your breasts are becoming more active (though not all mothers feel it). It is important to treat engorgement, to keep your breasts comfortable and your milk flowing well. Read more here:Engorged breasts – avoiding and treating.Read here abouthow milk production worksand how toincrease your milk supply.You can find information here on how to usebottles and other feeding tools.Exclusive ExpressingExpressing all the milk your baby needs is known as “exclusive pumping” or “EP”. You can read morehere. Some mothers choose to do this; many do it because their babies are not able to breastfeed. You might find it helpful to join an online support group for “EP mums”.If you need to express your milk for a baby who is not breastfeeding yet, it is important to work with a skilled breastfeeding supporter. You might also want to connect with other mothers who have needed to express milk – they can be your best cheerleaders while you do this important job! Yourlocal La Leche League groupwould love to support you.Setting the scene for breastfeeding – happy time at (or near) the breastMost babies need only time, patience, and gentle encouragement to help them start breastfeeding. Babies are born expecting to breastfeed, with a set of reflexes to help them do it. We need to keep them well fed (with expressed or formula milk), give them lots of relaxed time near the breast, and…. give the baby time.Here are some ideas to try:Hold your baby skin-to-skin. Babies use their whole bodies to feed. The more of their skin they feel against yours, the more likely they are to find the breast and start feeding. Undress your baby down to their nappy and move your clothes out of the way. If you are cold, you can put a blanket round both of you. Even if your baby doesn’t breastfeed yet, it feels lovely, and helps your baby get used to being at or near the breast. Holding your baby against your skin helps you make more milk, too! If your baby can’t tolerate being held in a feeding position, try holding them against your shoulder.Avoid holding your baby in a feeding position during medical procedures, especially if your baby will be having lots. Offer the breast afterwards instead, if it calms them.Try“laid-back” breastfeeding. Try putting your baby tummy-down, on the slope of your body as you recline comfortably (as if you are lying on a sun lounger). Placed like this, they can use their arms and legs to help themselves find the breast and attach well for feeding. This can work better than trying to “put” the baby to the breast, especially if they have already had difficult experiences of this.This videoshows you how. The safest place to do this is in a bed that has been set up following safe sleep guidance. See our article onsafer sleep.Turn up the smell!Newborn babies don’t recognise the breast well by sight, though they do recognise your face, and love looking at it. They find the breast mostly by feel and smell. The little bumps around your nipple (Montgomery’s glands) make a scented oil which helps your baby find the breast and encourages them to feed. You can give your baby extra help by expressing a bit of milk and rubbing it on and around your nipples. This can encourage your baby to feed by increasing the smell and giving them something to lick as they approach the breast!Try“drip-drop feeding”. Your partner or supporter uses a cup and spoon to drip milk (expressed milk or formula) onto the breast as you hold your baby. This can encourage babies to attach and feed. You can watch a videohere.Take a bath with your baby.When placed skin-to-skin with their mother in a warm bath, some babies find the breast and feed for the first time. Some mothers even describe it as “a second chance at giving birth”. You could set the scene with low lighting, a candle or soft music. Whether or not your baby is ready to breastfeed yet, sharing a bath can help you and your baby relax together and enjoy each other. Have another adult with you to help you get in and out safely, put the baby on you and wrap them in a warm towel when they are ready to get out.“Wear”your baby.Babies who are kept close in a sling or soft carrier cry less, are calmer and warmer than babies who are put down by themselves. Being carried is good for babies’ physical & emotional development and helps parents and babies make strong connections. If your baby is not breastfeeding yet, carrying them close, as much as you want, is an excellent way to help them feel comfortable near the breast. Always follow the instructions for your sling or carrier and therules for safe babywearing. You can read more about babywearing inthis book.Feed your baby at or near the breast. If your baby will go to the breast at all, consider using anursing supplementerso your baby can have extra milk while they breastfeed. This can be helpful when milk supply is low and/or your baby is frustrated by the speed of milk flow at the breast. If your baby is fed by cup or bottle, try feeding them skin-to-skin with their cheek against your breast. Let your baby end the feed by sleeping with their cheek pillowed on the breast.Consider sleeping with your baby. Some babies will attach and feed in their sleep if the breast is near enough to smell and feel.  Always considersleep safetybefore sleeping with your baby in your bed.   It is never safe to sleep with a baby on a sofa. You can read more about sleep safety and normal baby sleep in LLL’s bookSweet Sleep.Babies with low muscle tone (hypotonia)A baby who has been diagnosed with a condition that makes them hypotonic, or ‘floppy’, may show little interest in breastfeeding. To make feeding easier:Support your breast. Tuck a rolled-up cloth under your breast close to your chest wall, or support your breast with your thumb on one side of the areola, fingers on the other side.Support your baby’s chin. If your thumb is parallel to your baby’s upper lip, you can use your index finger to put gentle pressure just behind the bony part of the chin while your baby feeds.Try upright positions. A hypotonic baby often feeds better held with their head higher than their bottom.Breast compressioncan also be helpful, but you may also need to give some expressed milk until your baby’s muscle tone improves. Breast compressions are explained in more detail in “My baby needs more milk”.If your baby suddenly becomes floppy and you don’t know why, seek medical advice.Baby stepsWhen you are keen to breastfeed, but your baby isn’t yet ready, it can be frustrating. Don’t forget to celebrate how far you have already come! Every time your baby enjoys being held close to your body, or falls asleep near your breast, they are taking another “baby step” towards breastfeeding. Your baby is doing the best they can for now, and so are you.When breastfeeding is stressfulWhen breastfeeding is difficult for your baby, it may become stressful for both of you. Babies who have had unhappy experiences at the breast can develop negative associations with breastfeeding. This might happen, for example, when:A baby is in pain or discomfort e.g. from birth injury or allergy.A sensitive baby is handled at the breast in a way they don’t like, e.g., if a helper tries hard to “put” the baby to the breast when they aren’t ready.Milk supply is low.A baby has a physical restriction (e.g., tongue tie) that makes attaching and sucking difficult.A baby who is finding feeding difficult may become upset:A short time into the feed, when milk flow slows down.At the start of the feed, when milk doesn’t come straight away.When offered the breast.When put in a breastfeeding position.When they see the breast.When feeding isn’t going well, babies may come to associate the breast with hunger and frustration. They may develop apreference for another feeding method, such as a bottle, if they associate it with feeling full and satisfied. You can find some ideas on how to keep your baby’s relationship with the breast positive here:using donor milk & formula milk to support breastfeedingThe ideas in the previous section (“Setting the scene for breastfeeding – happy time at (or near) the breast”) can help your baby learn that the breast is a lovely place to be, and to associate it with calm, relaxation, comfort, and satisfaction rather than hunger and frustration.Take a breakIf breastfeeding has become very stressful for you and your baby, you might need a “breastfeeding break”.  You could stop trying for a few days, whilst expressing your milk to keep your baby fed and keep your milk flowing.  When you’re both ready, you can try again. There is no rush! Dr Christina Smillie, an American doctor who specialises in breastfeeding medicine, calls this “rebooting the baby”.What if my baby is still not breastfeeding?When you are eager to breastfeed, it is hard to wait. It is not uncommon for babies to need time to begin breastfeeding well. You might be encouraged by hearing the stories of other parents whose babies took time to get going.If your baby is still not breastfeeding even with time, patience and some of the tips in this article, there will be a reason why. A skilled breastfeeding supporter can help you find out, and work towards breastfeeding. Some babies need medical care, some benefit from feeding tools such asnipple shieldsand a few need treatment fortongue tie. Many just need a little more time.A few babies never do breastfeed. Some have a medical condition that makes it impossible. Very rarely, we never find out why. You don’t have to feed your baby directly from the breast to give them the many benefits of your milk or to nurture them at your breast. We can support you to have a close, happy feeding relationship with your baby, whatever form that takes.La Leche League Leaders (breastfeeding counsellors) can help.

Jaundice in Healthy Newborns,https://laleche.org.uk/jaundice/,"If your new baby has jaundice, it’s normal to be worried and concerned. Knowing more about newborn jaundice will help you decide if you need to see medical help and understand why tests may be needed.More than 80% of all newborns appear jaundiced during the first week of life. In most cases, this is a normal part of adjusting to life outside the womb, but occasionally jaundice is a sign of other more serious health problems. Jaundice is also more common in pre-term and premature babies, who need treatment to avoid serious health problems. Sometimes treatment of jaundice presents challenges that new breastfeeding mothers and their babies need to overcome.What causes jaundice?Breastfeeding and jaundiceWhen to be concernedDifferent types of jaundiceIs jaundice normal?Treating newborn jaundiceSleepy babyBreastfeed frequentlyEnough breastmilk?What causes jaundice?Most babies are born with more red blood cells than they need for life outside the womb. When these cells break down after birth, they produce a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which circulates in the blood. When bilirubin reaches the liver, it is changed into a form that can be transported to the intestines and passed out of the body in the baby’s poo. However, a newborn baby’s liver cannot process all the bilirubin at once. Excess bilirubin is deposited in the skin, muscles, and mucous membranes of the body, which look yellowish or a golden colour. This may be harder to notice on darker skin.Breastfeeding and jaundiceJaundice seems to occur more often and last longer in breastfed babies. It’s more serious in those who don’t breastfeed frequently in the first days of life. Newborns who nurse every hour or two have frequent poos, and this clears bilirubin from the intestines more efficiently. However some healthy breastfed babies may still show signs of jaundice at two or three weeks of age.When to be concerned?Seek medical help if your baby:appears jaundiced within 48 hours of birth;appears jaundiced beyond the third week;appears jaundiced and is premature or sick;shows yellowing of the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet;has black, brown or green poo after day 5shows signs of dehydration with fewer than five wet nappies per dayWhen a baby appears jaundiced, regular blood tests may be requested to monitor bilirubin levels.Continue breastfeedingFrequent breastfeeding during the first days of life will help clear bilirubin from your baby’s body.Babies who are breastfeeding well are less likely to be jaundiced. If your baby is jaundiced, continue to breastfeed and make sure they are getting enough milk. See our informationhereand seek help if you are unsure.Don’t give waterBilirubin is eliminated in a baby’s poo and a baby who is frequently breastfed will have plenty of bowel movements. Giving water or other breastmilk substitutes makes things worse as baby will nurse less often.Different types of jaundiceSuboptimal intake jaundiceOccurs within the first week in association with ongoing weight lossshould resolve within two weeksBreastmilk jaundiceJaundice which persists past 2-3 weeks along with healthy weight gain.May last up to three monthsTreatment is not generally requiredIs jaundice normal?When bilirubin levels rise slowly over the first three or four days, a baby probably has normal physiological jaundice. This is harmless and some experts think it may even be beneficial.When blood bilirubin levels are too high, bilirubin may enter the brain and damage the nervous system. High bilirubin levels and jaundice may be related to other health problems. Blood tests can identify these early, so the underlying problem can be treated.Treating Newborn JaundiceBlood TestsIf your baby finds blood tests distressing, it helps to breastfeed immediately after the test.PhototherapySometimes phototherapy is needed to treat newborn jaundice. Phototherapy uses special blue-green lights to break down the bilirubin stored in a baby’s skin so that it can be eliminated more easily. A baby lies under the ‘bili-lights’ wearing just a nappy, with their eyes covered to protect them. They stay under the lights continuously for a day or two, although you may remove them from the lights for feeds. Once the bilirubin levels begin to fall, the lights are no longer needed.Phototherapy restricts the time you can spend holding and nursing your baby. So if phototherapy is needed, try to do everything you can to stay close to them and continue to breastfeed as frequently as possible. This can be a stressful time for you –contact an LLL Leaderif you want support or to talk things through.Keep baby close during phototherapy:If you are still in the hospital, the phototherapy unit can usually be set up at the bedside, so that you can talk to your baby, touch them, and breastfeed frequently.In some cases, babies can receive phototherapy using a fibre-optic blanket that wraps around the baby’s body and provides continuous light treatment. Your baby’s eyes will not have to be covered, and you can hold and breastfeed them during treatment.Questions to ask about treatment optionsHow necessary is it to treat the jaundice at this stage?Could we continue to monitor our baby’s bilirubin levels, encourage him to breastfeed more frequently, and re-evaluate the situation in 24 hours?If phototherapy is needed, how can we ensure frequent breastfeeding?Sleepy BabyHigh bilirubin levels can make your baby sleepy and lethargic and less interested in breastfeeding. Encourage your sleepy baby to nurse well using the suggestions fromSleepy Baby—why and what to do.Breastfeed frequentlyFrequent breastfeeds help clear bilirubin from baby’s intestines more quickly. A baby who feeds well and often is less likely to have a problem with jaundice.Respond to your baby’s early feeding cues and encourage your baby to breastfeed at least 10–12 times in 24 hours.Help them to attach deeply and comfortably at the breast and nurse well. ‘Laid back breastfeeding’ positions where your baby is snuggled in full body contact against you for periods of time can encourage frequent,comfortable breastfeeding. Seek skilled help straight away if you are finding breastfeeding difficult or painful.If your baby is not breastfeeding effectively, express your milk every couple of hours to help establish milk production and reduce breast engorgement. Give small amounts of your expressed milk to your baby by cup or syringe. Once your baby has the food they need, they will have more energy to breastfeed.Enough breastmilk?What comes out is a sign of what has gone in, so counting dirty nappies can be a useful guide between weighing sessions.AgeDirty Nappies per 24 hours1-2 daysGreenish-black tarry meconium3-5 daysAt least 3 greenish transitional poos5+ daysAt least 3-5 yellow, loose unformed poos the size of a 2p coin or largerIf your baby is not getting enough milk, refer to our articleIs my baby getting enough milk?orMy baby needs more milkor seek support from an LLL leader to increase your milk production. Sometimes supplementing may be necessary while continuing to breastfeed.Seek supportIf you are feeling overwhelmed, an LLL Leader can provide a listening ear. She can also offer ideas to help you improve your baby’s attachment and suggest ways to encourage your baby to breastfeed better to help clear the jaundice.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of La Leche League GB.  Photo courtesy of Justine Fieth and Lena KnowlesFurther ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Is My Baby Getting Enough Milk?,https://laleche.org.uk/is-my-baby-getting-enough-milk/,"How do you tell if your baby is getting enough milk? In a world where everything is measured, it can be nerve-wracking when you can’t see how much milk your breasts are making.Follow your baby not the bookWeight gainDirty nappiesHow frequently are you breastfeeding?Sleepy baby?Breastfeeding solutionsBreast compressionsSimple ideas for boosting milk productionFollow your baby not the bookSome parenting books recommendroutinesfor breastfed babies. Butroutines can reduce breastmilk production, as can unnecessary supplements or adummy. Whatever their weight, a young baby needs to nurse at least 2–3 hourly to establish their mother’s milk supply and get enough milk.Frequent nursing is normal, partly because breastmilk is a drink as well as a food. Adults rarely go longer than a couple of hours without a drink, snack or meal. Your baby’s tummy is tiny and breastmilk is quickly digested so they need frequent feeds to help them grow.Weight gainNewborns often lose up to 7% of their birth weight in the first few days. Once your milk production increases, usually on day 3–4, expect your baby to begin regaining their lost weight.  Most babies regain their birth weight by 10–14 days old.  Your baby will grow at their own rate, and a growth chart will indicate how they are doing (seeFurther Reading). Once breastfeeding is going well and there are no concerns, weighing is advisable no more than once a month in the first six months. If there are concerns, monitor the trend of his weight change over several weeks rather than focusing on one particular week.Your baby’s weight may increase steadily and so follow a single percentile line on the chart, or rise faster, crossing the percentile lines. A gradual drop from one percentile line to the next (or the equivalent distance) is unlikely to be a problem unless your baby’s weight is low for their age. Heavier newborns often show ‘catch-down’ growth—meaning they gain weight steadily even though they gradually drop against the percentile lines. Dropping against the chart is more of a worry for lower weight babies. Seek help quickly if your baby isn’t gaining weight well.See our pageMy Baby Needs More Milk, or contact anLLL Leaderfor further information.Look at your babyYou may instinctively know how your baby is doing.  Ask yourself: Do they look healthy and seem active and alert? Are they meeting developmental milestones? Do they usually seem content and satisfied after breastfeeds.Dirty nappiesDirty nappies are a good indicator of how much milk your baby has taken. The table below shows what is normal.AgeDirty nappies per 24 hours1-2 daysgreenish-black tarry meconium3-5 daysat least 3 greenish transitional poos5+ daysat least 3-5 yellow, unformed poos, the size of a 2p coin or larger6 weeks +possibly less frequent but larger poosHow frequently are you breastfeeding?The more often you breastfeed, the more milk you will produce. You will make less milk if you breastfeed less often.In the early weeks, a baby needs to nurse about every 2–3 hours, or at least 8–12 times in a 24-hour period, including some feeds at night.Allow your baby to breastfeed for as long and as often as they seem interested. To help them get a balanced meal let them finish feeding from the first breast before offering the second.Sleepy baby?A baby who sleeps a lot rather than feeding every 2–3 hours may need to be wakened to nurse, and this is particularly important if they havejaundiceor they aren’t gaining enough weight. If this is difficult, or they are lethargic, ask your midwife, health visitor or GP to check that all is well. Our pageSleepy Baby  – why and what to doexplains more.For most breastfeeding problems there is a breastfeeding solution.  Almost all mothers can produce enough milk to meet their baby’s needs.Check your baby is latched on well.Make sure they have full body contact with you. Ensure they have a large mouthful of breast and listen and watch for swallowing as they feed. See our article which has lots of information about how to help your baby withpositioning and attachment.Breastfeed often, offering both breasts– at least 8-12 times in 24 hours. Wake your baby if necessary. Watch for rooting (head turning) or fist sucking – crying is a late sign of hunger.Encourage ‘cluster nursing’– breastfeed very often at times when your baby is willing to.Seek skilled help early onif you are finding breastfeeding difficult, uncomfortable or painful. Contact an LLL Leader for help.Keep your baby close– try laid back breastfeeding, reclining comfortably with your baby while lightly dressed or in skin-to-skin contact close to your breasts. They will have lots of opportunity to breastfeed, even in a light sleep, and this boosts levels of the hormones that increase your milk.Encourage breastfeeding for comfortas well as food as this boosts milk production. Stop using anydummy—breastfeed instead.Night feeds are especially importantfor establishing and increasing milk production. See our pageSafe Sleep & The Breastfed Baby.Get help with household jobs—ignore the jobs around the house and and eat simple, easily prepared meals so you can concentrate on resting and breastfeeding your baby.The most effective way to increase your milk production is to take your baby to bed with you for a day or two, and focus solely on nursing and caring for him, whilst other people take care of you.Breast compressionsBreast compressions can encourage a baby to breastfeed actively and take more milk:Support your breast with one hand—thumb on one side, fingers on the other.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, their jaw moving all the way to their ear. When they stop swallowing, compress your breast firmly to increase milk flow. Hold it squeezed while they continue swallowing, then release your hand.Rotate your hand around the breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast. Go gently—this should not hurt.Try switching breasts at least two or three times during each feed—when your baby comes off the first breast on their own or when breast compression no longer keeps them breastfeeding actively. As time goes by you’ll find that you no longer need to do this.Simple ideas for boosting milk productionRemoving small amounts of milk even from soft comfortable breasts increases milk production:Full breasts slow milk production.Babies nurse for comfort as well as for food:those little ‘in between’ comfort feeds really help your milk production.Your baby is fussy:Many babies have a regular fussy time (often evenings) however hungry or not they may be. Some babies need lots of stimulation; others need soothing. You’ll soon learn what your baby needs. If they settle at the breast, just let them nurse.Expect your baby to want to breastfeed very often from time to time:Your breasts will quickly adjust to making more milk if you follow your baby’sneeds.Your baby’s feeds may become shorterperhaps only five minutes at each breast. Most babies become very efficient at breastfeeding once nursing is going well.Babies’ feeding patterns are very individual: If your baby is gaining weight at an appropriate rate, then following the feeding pattern they choose is the best way to meet their needs. It may be different from other babies.For more information about increasing our milk supply if needed, see our article:How to increase your milk supply.Your milk is always perfect for your baby, even if he is gaining weight slowly. A breastfeeding solution is usually possible if he needs more milk.Contact your local LLL Leader.

Inverted nipples,https://laleche.org.uk/inverted-nipples/,"The size and shape of nipples and breasts vary widely between women. These differences have little to do with the ability to breastfeed—though if one or both nipples are flat or inverted some mothers find that establishing breastfeeding takes a little extra time and patience in the early days.Inverted nipples?Many nipples will protrude when stimulated.If you think yours may be inverted, try placing your thumb and finger on opposite sides of the areola (the darker area of skin surrounding the nipple) and squeezing gently inwards. A nipple that stands out when stimulated is not inverted. Sometimes nipples may be partly inverted, looking dimpled or folded. Severely inverted nipples usually retract deeply when compressed or stimulated.It’s common for nipples to change shape during pregnancy, gradually protruding more. After your baby is born, your nipples may appear flatter but babies often lick the nipple to stimulate it before latching on. Your nipples may also appear flatter if your breasts are very full or engorged.CausesTreatmentGood attachment is the keyComfortable breastfeedingIf your baby isn’t nursing wellSoften your breastStimulate your nipplesTry using a breast pumpNipple shieldsPracticalitiesGetting a deep latchSeek supportTreating inverted nipplesWhen further help is neededCausesInverted nipples may be caused by:Tiny bands of connective tissue connecting the nipple to the inner breast tissueShort milk ductsLess dense connective tissue beneath the nipple than in women with protruding nipplesTreatmentThere is no agreement about whether it is helpful to treat inverted nipples. The Royal College of Midwives believes that a diagnosis of flat or inverted nipples serves only to damage a mother’s confidence in her ability to breastfeed. While individual mothers sometimes find one of the treatments suggested overleaf for inverted nipples helpful, no controlled studies have shown any particular treatment to be effective. Whether or not you try the techniques below, do learn how to hand express milk. You may also like to try expressing your colostrum in the last four weeks of pregnancy. Any colostrum you collect can be frozen and given to your baby after the birth if needed.Antenatal Expression of Colostrumprovides more information.Good attachment is the keyWhatever breastfeeding specialists think about the different treatment options, they all agree that getting a deep latch is crucial. Babies breastfeed—not nipplefeed—so with effective positioning and attachment your baby can learn to nurse well even if you have flat or inverted nipples. When a baby takes in a large enough mouthful of breast he will be able to feed effectively, so the shape of your nipples may not be an issue at all. ReadingLa Leche League booksand leaflets before your baby is born will help you learn about breastfeeding and how to avoid common difficulties. Try to attend anLLL Meetingtoo—pregnant women are always welcome.Comfortable breastfeedingComfortable positioning and attachmentare important for all mothers. You will have time to practice with your baby while your breasts are soft before your milk comes in. Whether or not you have flattish nipples, start as soon as possible by holding your baby in skin-to-skin contact right after the birth. The earlier you start, the easier it is. laid-back or ‘natural’ positions can be a great help in encouraging your baby to latch on well, as well as being comfortable for you.If your baby isn’t nursing wellHand express or pumpto stimulate your breasts to make milk. Aim to express as often as your baby would be feeding, about 8–12 times in 24 hours. Your expressed milk can be offered by spoon, cup or syringe while you both learn how to breastfeed. Avoid using bottles or dummies as they may cause nipple confusion, making matters worse.Soften your breastBreastfeed as often as you can. When your baby bobs his head and licks the nipple, he naturally makes it easier to latch on. If your breast is full and hard, you can use reverse pressure softening to move fluids away from the nipple area so your baby can latch on well. Apply gentle steady pressure with your fingertips on the areola around your nipple for about a minute. You can also press with the sides of your thumbs or fingers. Denting the breast at the edge of the areola with a finger and placing your baby’s chin in the dent may also help. Gently hand express a little milk if needed.Stimulate your nipplesIf your baby’s head bobbing and licking isn’t enough to stimulate your nipples, try:Rolling your nipple gently between your thumb and fingerTouching your nipple with a cold moist clothTry using a breast pumpWith some deeply inverted nipples, when a baby tries to breastfeed, he compresses the buried nipple beneath his mother’s areola. If simpler techniques of stimulating your nipples before a feed fail, an automatic electric pump may be needed to provide suction to draw the nipple out before a feed. Once may be enough, or you may need to pump before each feed for a few days or perhaps weeks.Nipple shieldsAnipple shieldis a thin, silicone teat that can be placed over a mother’s nipple and may help a baby who is having difficulty learning to breastfeed. Nipple shields can be used temporarily to help establish breastfeeding. They come in different sizes—a comfortable fit is very important.It is very important to seek skilled help with positioning, attachment and any other problems if you are already using nipple shields or planning to use them. Whilst a nipple shield can be a useful tool it should be regarded as only a temporary solution—continue to offer your baby some time in skin-to-skin contact every day without a nipple shield so he has the opportunity to latch on if he is able.PracticalitiesFirst breastfeedsBreastfeed early and often after your baby’s birth to minimize engorgement. Many babies have no difficulty feeding from mothers with inverted nipples, so start off by putting him to the breast and see how he gets on. If he latches on well and you are comfortable he will get plenty of practice and will probably continue to feed well after your milk comes in and your breasts feel fuller.If your baby won’t breastfeedDon’t panic! A baby usually starts to suck spontaneously if he can snuggle up close to his mother’s bare chest for periods of time. Try letting your baby lie on your body as you recline so that both his chest and tummy are against you. This kind of contact, sometimes known asBiological Nurturing™, usually stimulates a baby’s instinct to attach and suckle well at the breast. In such positions babies can also latch on when sleepy or in light sleep. Watch for signs your baby is stirring and gently encourage feeding.Practical tipsGetting a deep latchHelp your baby get a deep mouthful of breast using the following tips:Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby. Relax comfortably with your breast in its natural positionKeep your baby’s whole body close against your bodyHelp your baby approach the breast ’nose to nipple’ with his chin on or close to the breast. Keep his body tucked in close as he attaches and feeds but make sure he can tip his head back easily to open his mouth wideAs your breast touches his tongue, it will push his lower jaw open wider. If you are sitting up, as he opens his mouth to take the breast pull his body in firmly against you and give a little push between his shoulder bladesThis will help him open his mouth very wide to get his top lip over the nipple area to latch on, resulting in a bigger and better mouthful of breastHis lower jaw will be tucked into your breast well away from the base of your nipple and his nose will be free. Active sucking is triggered when your breast tissue reaches the back of his mouthOnce your baby is attached you can make small adjustments to maximise your own comfort. If you’re sitting up to feed, try shifting your weight back onto your tail bone and reclining your body back a little to open up a space for your baby. This allows more of his weight to be supported by your body and less by your arms. Gravity can help him stay attached deeply.You can also experiment with different holds to help you find what works best for you. An LLL Leader can help you find the most effective approach. You can find more detailed information by reading our pagePositioning & Attachment.Some women like (or need) to hold their breast when nursing. Theyflatten their breast as they would a big sandwich they were offering to the baby, matching it to the oval of his mouth. This can help their baby grasp more breast tissue. It doesn’t matter if fingers are closer to the upper jaw but try to keep the “lower jaw fingers” out of your baby’s way.Exaggerated latchTo help get an even deeper latch you could try placing your thumb or finger near the base of the nipple where the middle of your baby’s upper lip will be, lined up with his nose. As you press, your nipple will tilt away from your baby, presenting him with your breast rather than your nipple. As he opens wide, snuggle him in close and use your thumb or finger to tuck the breast into his mouth. Your nipple will be taken in last and unroll in his mouth. You can then slip your finger out.Seek SupportMany mothers experience challenges with breastfeeding and findattending LLL meetingssupportive. They will give you the chance to see that, whatever challenges you may face, breastfeeding can become a rewarding experience. If there is noLLL groupin your area, you can stillcontact an LLL Leader for support.Treating inverted nipplesVarious techniques can be used to draw out nipples—though research on their effectiveness is inconclusive. If using devices, it is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions.The Hoffman TechniqueThis technique is used during pregnancy. With a thumb on each side of the base of the  nipple, press in firmly against the breast tissue and at the same time pull your thumbs away  from each other. If this feels comfortable, repeat five times each morning, moving your thumbs around the base of the nipple. If you experience pain this technique may not be appropriate for you.The Nipplette™The Nipplette™ is a device that uses suction to help a nipple protrude. It consists of a transparent nipple mould from which air is sucked using a small syringe. The device is placed over the nipple area for increasing time each day during the first six months of  pregnancy. One device is needed for each inverted nipple. The manufacturers do not recommend use in the last three months of pregnancy. While breastfeeding, limit use to a  few minutes to draw out the nipple immediately before breastfeeding.Breast shellsSometimes, two-piece breast shells are suggested to apply steady pressure to encourage flat or inverted nipples to protrude. Whilst individual mothers report that using breast shells is a help, research has found them to be ineffective. They can be worn during pregnancy or before breastfeeds. If you decide to try breast shells, wear them for no longer than 30 minutes before feeds to reduce the risk of nipple soreness due to lack of air circulating around the nipple and blocked ducts due to pressure. You may need a bra with a larger cup size than normal. Breast shells need to be washed daily and any milk collected should be discarded because of the risk of bacterial growth.Other concernsSore nipplesYou may experience some discomfort in the first couple of weeks of breastfeeding as your baby gradually draws your nipple out. This is temporary and different from nipple damage and soreness caused by a baby who isn’t latching on well. Pat your nipples dry after feeds, replace breast pads frequently and change wet bras. Your aim is for comfortable, relaxed feeds for you and your baby. So seek skilled help if you do experience nipple damage.One breast preferenceDifferences in your nipples can lead to your baby preferring one breast to the other. You can encourage your baby to breastfeed on the least preferred side by putting your baby to the breast when he is in light sleep, offering it first at feeds and by breastfeeding frequently. Some mothers express from the least preferred breast to maintain milk production. However, some babies are quite determined in their preferences and end up breastfeeding from only one side. If this happens, milk production from the preferred breast will increase to meet your baby’s needs as the other breast produces less. Any lop-sidedness will be temporary.When further help is neededIf you have flat or inverted nipples and then experience additional challenges such as a premature birth or a thrush infection, seek help from your midwife orLLL Leader.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone & mothers of LLLGB.  Photos courtesy Lois Rowlands and Kate Riley.Further ReadingAntenatal Expression of ColostrumBeginning BreastfeedingComfortable BreastfeedingEngorged breasts – avoiding and treatingHand Expression of BreastmilkIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?My Baby Won’t BreastfeedNipple ConfusionNipple ShieldsSleepy Baby – why and what to doFrom LLLIInverted nipples don’t stop breastfeedingBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

If You Leave Your Baby,https://laleche.org.uk/if-you-leave-your-baby/,"When you and your baby have a satisfying breastfeeding relationship, preparing for any separation can leave you with mixed feelings. This is regardless of whether you’ll be away from your baby for just an hour or two, or longer. You may be concerned about whether your baby will take your expressed breastmilk in your absence and whether he will be happy being looked after by someone else.A breastfeeding mother often finds it easier to keep her baby with her when at all possible, rather than making arrangements for separation. A little creative thinking may get around many obstacles. However, for situations when it’s necessary to leave your baby with someone else, these tips from other mothers may help you and your baby.Your baby’s carePractical considerationsMore than one feeding optionHow much milkPracticalitiesReverse cycle nursingSolid foodsAn evening outTime can make a differenceYour baby still needs youYour baby’s careYour baby may be distressed by being separated from you and that is normal. Being left with a stranger, however kind and caring that person may be, can be frightening for a young  child. So try to find a carer your baby already knows and loves, eg his other parent, carer or grandparent. If this isn’t possible, choosing someone who has looked after breastfed babies before and who will respect your own mothering style is going to be best for you both. Allow as much time as possible for your baby to get to know his caregiver gradually in your presence before leaving him. Talk with whoever is to look after him about your baby’s needs and your expectations for his care, and explain that you will be leaving your own milk for him.If you are returning to work, choosing childcare near your workplace can often reduce the time you are away from your baby. It may allow you to go to breastfeed him during your lunch hour, or your baby to be brought to you. However, what’s most important is to have a caregiver you and your baby are comfortable with, even if they are further from your workplace.If your baby will be in a group setting, ask who will be your child’s key worker so you can speak directly with them. When returning to work, arrange to leave your child with his carer for short introductory periods of time before leaving him for a whole day.Practical considerationsExplain about your baby’s preferences and how you would like him cared for. Consider:Feeding patterns. Explain how his milk feeds should be offered, how often and how to recognise your baby is hungry.Reminding the carer to offer only your milk unless you’ve given permission for your baby to have other foods and drinks.Storage and preparation of your milk.If your baby is over 6 months, what foods and drinks he is used to and whether he prefers to feed himself.Your child’s favourite toys and activities.His individual character and how he approaches new situations.Nap patterns and how he prefers to be settled to sleep.It’s a good idea to discuss what to do if your baby refuses to feed or is upset. A good carer will have his or her own suggestions too. Lots of physical contact and attention will help your baby while you’re away. Familiar toys and feeding utensils can also help a baby feel comfortable.Source: United States Breastfeeding CommitteeMore than one feeding optionMany breastfed babies never have bottles even in situations when mothers and babies are apart. Your baby can be offered your milk in several ways—you can opt for whichever he prefers. Detailed information on the feeding options outlined below—including ideas for when a baby is reluctant to take a bottle—are given on our pageWhen Mum Can’t Be There.Babiesunder three months: very young babies can be fed breastmilk from a small feeding cup, a spoon, or a feeding syringe.Fromthree months: using either an open cup or a baby beaker with a simple spout (no valves) is an option for a baby from three months of age. A baby will often take drinks from these when his mother is present, which can reassure you that your baby will take milk while you are away. You can give your baby the chance to experiment with a spouted or open cup that he can hold himself.Once your baby issix months old, you can offer water or occasionally very diluted juice in a cup to encourage him to drink. Sit at a table with him and have a drink yourself, so he can copy you. You could pretend to drink from his beaker, and emphasise the pleasure of drinking. The social interaction can be very important, compensating for the closeness of breastfeeding to help your baby accept the alternatives more readily.Bottles: there are disadvantages to using bottles to feed very young breastfed babies. They may develop ‘nipple confusion’, as sucking at the breast requires a different technique from sucking at a bottle. Once breastfeeding is well established this is less likely to be a problem, though many babies resist or refuse to take a bottle. The longer you can wait to leave your baby, the easier it is to avoid bottles altogether.How much milk?It’s very difficult to determine how much a breastfed baby will drink when separated from his mother. Much will depend on his age, how well fed he is beforehand and for how long he is left. There’s evidence that fully breastfed babies require less milk than formula fed babies— as much as 25% fewer calories at four months. No one can predict how much milk an individual baby will want at a particular feed, although a regular caregiver will soon get a good idea of how much a baby usually takes. On average, breastfed babies take between 60–120 ml (2–4 oz) about 8 to 10 times per day. It’s unlikely that a breastfed baby would consume 240 ml (8 oz) of breastmilk at one feed.PracticalitiesPlan to nurse your baby just before you leave and immediately upon your return. That way you needn’t worry if he only takes small amounts whilst you are gone. It will also reduce the number of times you need to express whilst away and help you avoid engorgement or mastitis. If you are not able to breastfeed at the caregiver’s prior to leaving your baby, nursing just before you leave home is an alternative. Some mothers nurse in the car outside their caregiver’s.Reverse cycle nursingMany babies adapt to their mother’s working hours, taking very little milk from their caregiver and then nursing very frequently when mother is around. This frequent nursing helps make up for a mother’s absence and also helps maintain milk production. The less you are apart the easier it will be for your baby to compensate for missed feeds. You may also find sleeping close to your baby helps you cope more easily with night waking.Taking time to concentrate on your baby’s needs is the greatest help in maintaining your relationship, whatever a baby’s reaction to separation. If your baby appears to reject you it is even more important that you give him as much of your time and attention as possible. It isn’t really a rejection of you, but a normal reaction to the stress of separation. You may find that he becomes very clingy, and doesn’t want you to leave or put him down. Encouraging better attachment to his caregiver—perhaps by spending time together with your baby and his caregiver— may help him feel more secure when you are away. Some mothers find it helpful to reduce their working hours temporarily.Solid foodsBreastfed babies are often very good at moderating their own intake of foods and fluid, and not taking more then they need. A healthy baby is more likely to take whatever food and drink is available, than go hungry or thirsty. If your baby is taking solid foods, these will compensate if he refuses to take much expressed breastmilk. Many foods contain water, especially fruits. It’s also possible to offer expressed milk mixed with some solid foods. Some babies prefer to take a drink with solids, so offering a drink with a snack may be a good option. If your baby has solids, it’s important to let your carer know what he’s used to. If you aren’t providing food yourself, share information on what he can eat and whether to serve it as finger food, mashed or pureed. If your baby feeds himself, tell your caregiver, as many people expect to spoonfeed babies.An evening outIf you’re planning to leave your baby for an evening out, you may have more options than you think. Some mothers choose to meet with friends during the day. There may be a time of day when your baby is more content for you to be away. Others arrange a suitable  get together so they can take their babies along too.Although drinking substantial amounts of alcohol regularly can have an impact on your milk supply and can lead to poor weight gain and motor development in your baby, research shows that an occasional beer or a glass of wine is not harmful for nursing babies. As alcohol inhibits oxytocin release, thus reducing milk letdown, nursing right after a couple of drinks can temporarily decrease the baby’s milk intake, although studies show that the baby will make up for it by nursing more often once maternal alcohol levels are back to normal. If you are planning to drink while you’re out, you may want to breastfeed your baby before your do so and then wait until your body has metabolised the alcohol (approximately 1 ounce in 3 hours) before nursing again. The less alcohol you drink, the shorter it will take for it be gone from your milk. Alternatively, you may want to consider having a non-alcoholic drink. You can  read more about alcohol and breastfeedinghere.If you drink heavily and need to express for comfort during or after, discard this milk. Consider whether the alcohol you drink will make you less responsive to your baby and less able to care for him. Remember that younger babies are more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and thatbedsharing is unsafe if anyone in the bed has drunk alcohol.Time can make a differenceA few weeks can make a lot of difference in the life of a baby, especially to your baby’s coordination, ability to sit up, and readiness for solid foods and other ways of taking drinks. If you’ve been trying unsuccessfully to introduce a bottle prior to a necessary separation, why not take a break? Try to relax and trust your plans will go well. If you feel stressed and preoccupied with the coming separation, your baby may react to this. There are always other feeding options that can ensure your baby’s needs are met. Some mothers have found that exploring ways of delaying or avoiding separation from their babies has been possible and best for them both.Your baby still needs youBeing able to breastfeed frequently when you are back together will help him adjust to the times when you are unavailable. Breastfeeding is so much more than just food; it’s an opportunity for your baby to feel safe and secure. And it will also help protect him from any illnesses with which he comes into contact while you are apart. He really is a very lucky baby to have a mother who cares so much about his needs. By continuing to breastfeed you are giving him a sense of normality and the opportunity to be close to the most important person in his life just now: YOU.Written by Karen Butler and mothers of La Leche League Great Britain.

Dummies and Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/dummies-and-breastfeeding/,"Sucking is a basic instinct that babies are born with. Babies suck for both food and comfort. Breastmilk also provides protection against disease so nature has made sure that babies love to be at the breast. They are comforted by the warmth, smell, delicious milk and reassuring sound of your heartbeat.Breastfeeding offers a lot of security too, whether your baby is feeling lonely, frightened, sad, cross, or ill at ease with a new situation.In the early days, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by your baby’s need to nurse. But meeting his needs makes him feel safe and ensures you have plenty of milk. As he grows, your baby’s nursing pattern will change and life with your new baby should settle down.Whenever a substitute for sucking at the breast is used there is a risk of affecting the breastfeeding relationship, especially for a baby who has not yet mastered nursing at the breast.Milk productionBreastfeeding problemsEarly weaningWhy give a dummyInfectionsDental problemsProblems for motherIf breastfeeding is affectedWeaning from a dummyBreastfeeding, Dummies and SIDSMilk productionDummy use may reduce your milk production and result in poor weight gain. In the early weeks it’s really important to nurse often and ensure all sucking is at the breast to establish and maintain good milk production.Breastfeeding problemsUsing a dummy can make it harder for your baby to breastfeed comfortably and effectively (1). The shape and firmer feel of a dummy differs from your pliable breast. Some babies may prefer the stronger sucking trigger of a dummy, leading to ‘confusion’ about how to nurse at the softer breast. The result may be sore nipples for you and not enough milk for your baby. He may become frustrated and start to fuss, cry or refuse to breastfeed altogether.Early weaningRegular dummy use is associated with premature weaning (1,2).  A dummy is often assumed to be an essential parenting tool. A baby is comforted by sucking, so what could be more convenient than a small portable device to pop in his mouth? But will offering a dummy cause problems with breastfeeding or can you combine the two?Babies like to suck for pure pleasure even when milk flow slows. You have only to look at your older baby to see this—he frequently looks up into your eyes then breaks off sucking to give you a great big smile. You in turn smile and talk to your baby. These are the first steps in your baby’s development of language and relationships.Why give a dummy?It’s important to remember that a dummy is a substitute for the breast—an object to silence, or pacify a baby’s crying until the real thing is available. For this reason it doesn’t really make sense for people to suggest a baby is using his mother as a ‘human dummy’ when he wants to nurse for comfort.There may be occasions when it’s convenient to use a dummy—to calm your baby briefly when you can’t nurse him immediately, for example if you’re driving. Sometimes a baby with colic will find it soothing to suck on a dummy between feeds.If you decide to give your baby a dummy, it’s better to wait until breastfeeding is well-established and he is gaining weight well. You will also need to follow manufacturer’s guidelines on cleaning and replacement.In some hospitals premature babies may be given a dummy during tube feeding to stimulate their sucking reflex, help digestion and help them associate the action of sucking with receiving food. It’s best if this is just a temporary substitute and efforts are made to establish breastfeeding as soon as possible.InfectionsYour baby has an increased risk of ear infections if he regularly has a dummy (3).Thrushcan be a problem too, as it thrives on moist surfaces at room temperature.Dental problemsBreastfeeding provides exercise for optimum development of a baby’s mouth, tongue and jaws and many orthodontists say they see fewer dental problems in breastfed babies. Regular dummy use can affect the growth of teeth and the shape of babies’ mouths, increasing the risk of sleep apnoea* and the need for braces later on (4,5). It can also increase the levels of decay-causing bacteria in babies’ mouths (4).Problems for mothersYou can be at risk of engorgement and mastitis when you introduce a dummy—a particular problem if you have an oversupply of milk. Your periods and fertility may also return earlier as your hormone levels are affected when your baby nurses less.Don’t forgetMany babies have no interest in using a dummy. You are the best pacifier in the world from your baby’s point of view. And what could be more natural than to bring peace to your baby with the warmth of your presence through breastfeeding, rather than with a plastic device.If breastfeeding is affectedStop using the dummy so that your baby can concentrate on learning to feed well at the breast.Offer a breastfeed while he is still calm and pay extra attention to how he is positioned and attached at the breast.Encourage your baby to breastfeed at least 8–12 times in 24 hours, offering both sides and allowing him to nurse for comfort.To encourage his interest in breastfeeding hand express so milk is flowing before offering the breast.Ask yourLLL Leaderabout the technique of breast compression which has been found to encourage babies to continue breastfeeding actively for longer.Spend extra time cuddling, carrying and holding your baby, including skin-to-skin contact to help him relax and encourage his interest in breastfeeding.Weaning from a dummyRegardless of whether it affects  breastfeeding, you and your baby can become over-attached to a dummy. It is easy to find yourself using it more and more and your toddler’s language and social development may be delayed. It is recommended that parents stop using a dummy once a baby is 6 months old.You may need to wean yourself from the convenience of popping in the dummy when your baby fusses and give extra attention, cuddling or nursing instead.To reduce or cut out dummy use, try:Offering to nurse instead.Restricting your baby’s dummy use to certain times such as only in the car.Carrying him, taking him for a walk in the buggy, giving him a bath, playing games, singing or sharing other interesting activities.If your baby has become accustomed to falling asleep with a dummy, the simplest option is to breastfeed him instead. From 6 months:Try gently removing the dummy once he is asleep or very sleepy so that he gradually learns to fall asleep without it.Keep trying as new sleep associations take a while to establish. You could introduce other sleep cues such as wrapping in a blanket, rubbing his back, rocking and/or a key word, for example ‘shh’.Extra time focussing on your baby’s needs whilst working to reduce dummy use will help the change go more smoothly. If you have any questions or need support as you wean your baby from using a dummy you can contact an LLL Leader by calling ourHelpline. You can find your local grouphere.Breastfeeding, Dummies and SIDSSome research has shown that using a dummy to settle a baby to sleep can reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (6,7). The cause and effect is unknown, and may be related to other protective factors. It is possible that a baby falling asleep with a dummy mimics babies falling asleep at the breast (8,9) Babies generally keep a dummy in the mouth for less than 15 minutes at sleep times (10)—similar to the time it takes a baby to breastfeed to sleep.Current recommendations for dummy use at sleep times (6,11) are that a dummy should:Not be used to replace breastfeeding.Not be replaced after a baby falls asleep.Not be given to a baby who doesn’t want it.It would seem from these recommendations, that a baby who breastfeeds to sleep is unlikely to want or need a dummy.*Sleep apnoea: irregular breathing during sleep.Further ReadingBeginning BreastfeedingMy Baby Needs More MilkNipple Confusion?Safe Sleep & The Breastfed BabySleepy Baby – Why & What To DoBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, LLLI.

Caesarean Birth and Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/caesarean-birth-and-breastfeeding/,"During pregnancy your body is preparing to give birth and your breasts are getting ready to feed your baby.  If you are told you need to have a caesarean birth you may wonder if you will still be able to breastfeed as you planned. Mothers successfully breastfeed after a caesarean birth and you can expect your healthcare professionals to support you with getting breastfeeding established straight away.Whichever way we give birth, our bodies need time to recover and to adjust to feeding a new baby. Birth by caesarean usually means a longer hospital stay, and a longer recovery time because this is major abdominal surgery so practical support from friends and family can make a big difference to you.Before the birthCommon concernsA good start for breastfeedingPractical help and supportBefore the birthWhichever way you will be giving birth, find out as much as you can beforehand about labour and breastfeeding. Whilst some aspects will be out of your control, choosing your place of birth and your caregiver can reduce your chance of a caesarean.An induced birth can lead to more interventions, increasing the chance you’ll need a caesarean.Continuous support during labour from a woman you feel comfortable with and trust can reduce the risk of a caesarean birth.Simple things like eating and drinking, moving around and relaxation can improve your experience of labour.Tell hospital staff beforehand that you plan to breastfeed and to emphasise:You want to keep your baby with you, provided neither of you needs special care.You don’t want your baby to be given bottles or dummies without your permission, because this will interfere with breastfeeding.An unplanned caesareanA caesarean after a long or difficult labour can leave you feeling extremely tired and frustrated. However the hormones released during labour have already prepared you and your baby for breastfeeding.A planned caesareanKnowing in advance that you will be having your baby by caesarean can let you prepare, both emotionally and practically. When possible, going into labour first can help get breastfeeding off to an easier start. If you have had a previous caesarean, it is not always necessary to have one the next time. Discuss your options with your health professionals.After an caesareanWhether or not your caesarean was planned, you may still feel upset or sad about what happened and mourn the loss of the birth experience you were hoping for. It is quite understandable to feel this way and these feelings may affect the way you feel about your baby and breastfeeding at first.Breastfeeding can give you confidence in your body’s abilities. When you breastfeed, your baby needs you. The close physical contact can also help you to feel better emotionally. Breastfeeding helps your womb to contract, which will help you heal more quickly. And it’s nature’s way of ensuring you spend time sitting or lying down, resting and recovering.Common concernsIVs or dripsTo make holding and feeding your baby easier, ask that your IV drip be inserted into your forearm, rather than in the back of your hand (and without the supporting board if one is used). You can request that your catheter be inserted after your spinal anaesthetic has taken effect, to make the procedure more comfortable.The extra fluid from an IV can increase engorgement. Before breastfeeding, you can easy any swelling back by pressing your fingers around the nipple area (reverse pressure softening) and seeEngorged Breasts—Avoiding and Treatingfor suggestions.IV fluid will also transfer to your baby. This can lead to an artificially high brith weight which may result in a higher percentage weight loss in the early days. Weighing your baby at 24 hours old may give a more accurate baseline weight.AnaestheticAny anaesthetic in your system will not be harmful to your baby. However the anaesthetic may make your baby very sleepy during the first few days—you may have to wake them up and encourage them to nurse. Keep them close and offer the breast whenever they stir.Antibiotics and pain reliefPain relief and antibiotics are routinely given after a caesarean. Pain relief will be essential to help you through the early days. Over the counter pain medications, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, are considered safe for breastfeeding. If you need something stronger, then discuss this with your health care team, who can check which drugs are compatible with breastfeeding. You may need further antibiotics, but be aware that these increase the risk of a thrush infection for you and your baby.A good start for breastfeedingExpress your milkSeparation or feeding problems are more likely if your baby is born early, if you have an induced birth, or if you have a health problem such as diabetes. It can be very helpful to express and store colostrum before the birth so that your milk will be available for your baby if separation occurs. SeeAntenatal Expression of Colostrum.If your baby is a bit sleepy at first you can hand express drops of colostrum and give it on a spoon. You partner could help with this.It can sometimes take a little longer to have a plentiful milk supply after a caesarean birth. Hand expressing frequently will encourage this process. If you baby needs a supplement offer it with a spoon, syringe, feeding cup or supplementer.Breastfeed as soon as possibleYou can breastfeed as soon as you are alert enough to hold your baby, in the recovery room or even on the delivery table. At this stage you will be free from pain as the anaesthetic will not have worn off. Although you may be lying flat on your back and may need some help positioning your baby, you don’t need to be sitting up to breastfeed. Simply lying there, skin-to-skin is enough to prompt a baby to nuzzle onto your breast themself. If you are drowsy your partner can help by holding your baby close to you.Skin-to-skin contact with your babyIt’s important and never too late, to enjoy skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Tuck a blanket over both of you to keep warm. Skin-to-skinEncourages your baby to latch on and feed frequently.Helps colonise your baby’s skin with your own individual ‘good’ bacteria.Calms your baby and regulates their temperature.Encourages bonding.If your need for medical care prevents this happening straight away, your birth partner can step in. Babies still benefit from sking-to-skin contact even when they can’t be with you.Get comfortable for breastfeedsGetting your baby attached well at the breast helps them to feed effectively and helps prevent nipple damage. Lying down, laid back or using the underarm position may be easiest at first. Use extra pillows for support and comfort—behind your back, under your arms or between your knees. A rolled up towel or small pillow can cover and protect your incision. . SeePositioning & Attachmentfor tips. Be aware that pain relief can mask pain during breastfeeding. If your nipples are squashed or flattened after feeds, or look sore or damaged, seek help without delay.Baby feeding cuesMothers often find they need help responding to their babies’ early feeding cues. If you feel groggy after birth, it helps if the people supporting you are aware of the signs your baby needs to feed. These include, in increasing urgency:Opening their mouth, making sucking motions and turning their head (rooting) looking for the nipple.Moving their tongue.Furrowing their eyebrows—perhaps showing tension in their face.Clenching and unclenching their fists.Flexing their arms.Moving their hands to their mouth.Followed by restless movement.Then crying—the last resort.Practical help and supportIt is useful to check hospital policies on visitors, so you can arrange as much help as possible. Even in hospital, it will be much easier with your partner, family member or friend to help you care for your baby. If you are on your own, ring for help from hospital staff when you need it.Once at home, extra help will be essential. You will be recovering from major abdominal surgery and need to rest, recover and concentrate on nursing your baby. You may be advised not to drive for about six weeks. Organise as much help as possible with meals, laundry and essential housework, and with caring for any older children. Drink enough fluids to keep your urine pale, and eat a balanced diet. Simple meals will be easier to prepare.SeeSupporting a Breastfeeding MotherandAdjusting to Motherhoodinclude practical tips on making life easier after birth.Support for breastfeedingTry to contact an LLL Leader, attend an LLL meeting or join an LLL Facebook group before your baby arrives to establish your support network.

Beginning Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/beginning-breastfeeding/,"Breastfeeding is normal and natural but it may take you and your baby time to learn.Breastfeed earlyBreastfeed oftenColostrumLearn to breastfeed comfortablyAllow them to take full feedsWatch for signs they are hungryAfter your milk comes inGive only your milkNight feeds are importantGet to know and enjoy your babyCoping with engorgementHelp for sore nipplesBreastfeed earlyYour breasts will already be making colostrum (first milk).Lay your baby against you skin-to-skin as soon as you can, to make the most of their inborn instinct to breastfeed. Ideally do this within the first hour after birth before any interruptions such as washing and weighing.It’s never too late to startBiological Nurturing, even if your baby is sleepy due to drugs you had in labour—spending lots of time skin-to-skin helps babies breastfeed well.Breastfeed oftenBabies have tiny tummies so they can’t wait long for food.Encourage your newborn to breastfeed at least 8 to 12 times in 24 hours.Your colostrum (first milk) is made in just the right amounts for your baby’s tiny tummy.Small, frequent feeds ensure that your baby takes in all the milk he needs—the more you nurse, the more milk you will make.ColostrumThis concentrated milk produced in the first few days clears meconium (first poo), reduces jaundice. Colostrum provides their first immunity boost and lines and protects their intestines.Learn tobreastfeed comfortablyUse your baby’s natural reflexes to help them get a good latch.Get yourself comfortable and well supported. Nursing pillows can get in the way so tuck cushions in for support after your baby is latched, or to support your arms and back.Keep your breast at its natural level.Hold your baby so they are cuddled in close against you, their body in full contact with yours. So their whole front is close against yours, wrapped around or along your body.Align them ‘nose to nipple’ to encourage them to extend their neck. That will help them open their mouth wide and get a deep, comfortable latch.Seek skilled help early on if you are finding breastfeeding difficult or uncomfortable.Allow them to take a full feedThere is no need to time each breastfeed— they will let you know they have had enough by letting go or falling asleep.Offer the other breast if they want it. That way they’ll get what they need and your breasts will be encouraged to make plenty of milk.Watch for signs they are hungryWriggling or fidgeting, rooting (head turning) and fist sucking are all early signs of hunger.Offer a breastfeed while they are still calm—crying is a late sign of hunger.Just like you, they will be hungrier and thirstier at some times of the day than at others. Many babies ‘cluster nurse’ and space feeds closer together at certain times of the day, especially during the evening.Some babies sleep a lot at first because of the effects of anaesthetics during birth or because they’rejaundiced.  This can mean they’re not able to feed as much as they need. More information aboutsleepy babies.Watch for signs he is getting enough milkAfter your milk comes inListen for swallowing during feeds.At least three yellow 50p coin sized poos in each 24 hours are a sign they’re getting enough milk.Seek skilled help if your baby seems constantly unsettled, even after a long breastfeed.Encourage a sleepy baby to feed actively 10 to 12 times in 24 hours. Hold them more and encourage latching on when awake and during periods of light sleep.Is My Baby Getting Enough milk?Give only your milkYour healthy full-term baby doesn’t need any other fluids or solids until around six months.Giving infant formula or other liquids reduces your milk production and may trigger allergies.As well as affecting your milk production, bottles or dummies can confuse your baby’s sucking technique and make them reluctant to breastfeed. SeeDummies & Breastfeedingfor more about this.If a supplement is needed, try using a spoon, flexible feeding cup or syringe. Our article here may help with ideas of how to give your baby any extra milk:My baby needs more milk.Night feeds are importantYour baby will need to breastfeed during the night to ensure they take in enough milk.Night feeds will help you to establish and maintain your milk supply and avoid engorgement, blocked ducts and mastitis.You can make night feeds easier by keeping your baby close by.For more information see our page onSafe Sleep & the Breastfed Baby.Milk production speeds up (your body makes more milk faster) if you nurse or pump more frequently. The emptier the breast, the faster your body works to replace the milk that was taken out. Milk is being produced at all times, and breasts are only ever about 75% empty, even after a very long feeding. For more information on how your breasts make milk see:How milk production works.Get to know and enjoy your babyYou will soon learn what they need and enjoy. The easiest way to care for a newborn baby is to accept and meet their need for closeness.  Other family members can enjoy closeness too —by cuddling, changing, bathing or carrying baby in a sling.Settle into your own rhythmsThe responsibility of looking after a baby 24 hours a day can be quite overwhelming at first. Try to relax—soon you will find gentle patterns emerging. You can then build on these patterns, creating a daily rhythm to suit you both.  Read more aboutRhythms and Routines.Get out and aboutGoing out can prevent you feeling isolated and give structure to your day, entertain your baby and give you a sense of purpose. Breastmilk is the ultimate in travel food – no need to take bottles of formula with you. If you wish, it’s easy to be discreet while breastfeeding, so that other people may not even notice. It helps to practise at home in front of a mirror. Offer a feed before your baby gets frantic—after all, a crying baby will guarantee an audience! For more ideas see our articleOut and about with your breastfed baby.As time goes byYour healthy baby needs only your milk until about the middle of the first year, when they start to show signs of readiness for solids. If you are returning to work, you can express your milk and continue to breastfeed when you are together.Growth spurtsBabies have frequent growth spurts starting in the first few weeks. During a growth spurt your baby will be extra hungry—nurse as often as you can to increase your milk production. Your breasts will also feel softer and more comfortable as your milk production is established. This can coincide with a growth spurt. Don’t panic, you are still producing plenty of milk and feeding will settle down again soon.  Have a look at the ways you can tell if yourBaby Getting Enough Milk?Coping with engorgementBreastfeed as often as you can.Reverse pressure softeningmoves fluids away from the nipple area so your baby can latch on well:Press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple.Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola. You can also press with the sides of your fingers.Place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be. Gently hand express a little milk if needed.Warm moist heat just before feeding helps milk flow. Cold compresses between feeds help reduce swelling and pain.Help for sore nipplesRemember—getting your baby latched oncomfortablyis important for preventing sore nipples. Pain is a sign that something needs changing—seek skilled help. Nurse your baby before they are really hungry. Offer the least sore breast first and try different nursing positions. Insert your finger between your baby’s gums if you need to remove them from the breast. If you experience itchy or burning nipples or shooting pains during or between feeds talk with an LLL Leader to help identify the cause.Help for sore breastsA tender spot or a sore lump or a red area on pale skin may be a blocked duct. Avoid mastitis by nursing frequently to keep milk flowing. Use different nursing positions and check your baby’s attachment at the breast. Rest and treat as for engorgement. Avoid bras and clothing that cause pressure on the breast. Seek medical help if things don’t improve.Seek supportIt is OK to ask for help—it can take a while for breastfeeding to become easy, or for your baby to learn to breastfeed effectively. It will get easier as time goes on. You can easily get skilled help from an LLL Leader by calling ourHelpline.

Antenatal Expression of Colostrum,https://laleche.org.uk/antenatal-expression-of-colostrum/,"Mothers start to produce colostrum (early milk) while pregnant. Being able to express colostrum is a useful skill to have. Saving your expressed colostrum may also be beneficial if your baby is likely to need special care after birth.Why express while pregnant?Being familiar with your breasts and how they work will give you confidence for after the birth.You’ll be able to express a small amount of colostrum onto your nipple if your baby needs encouragement to feed.You’ll be able to express colostrum for your baby if he has difficulty feeding or is cared for in the neonatal intensive care or special care baby unit.Being able to hand express will help you avoid problems with engorgement and mastitis.If your baby doesn’t breastfeed well in the first few days, being able to hand express will help you:Express your milk if needed.Provide your own milk for your baby to prevent or treat conditions such as low blood sugar or jaundice.Avoid the need to give infant formula.Special circumstancesLearning to hand express while pregnant, and collecting and saving the colostrum can be helpful in some special situations, including:Planned caesarean or induced birthConsider expressing the day before birth so your milk is available if you and your baby are separated. This will be especially useful if your baby will be born early.Babies with a cleft lip or palateThis may be diagnosed during pregnancy. Babies with any form of cleft can find it harder to breastfeed. Breastfeeding is particularly important for the first six months as it helps protect these babies against ear and respiratory infections. When the cleft is repaired, your milk helps promote healing and protects your baby against hospital germs.Mothers with diabetesIn the first 24 hours after birth, babies of diabetic mothers risk developing low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). A baby needs colostrum to  maintain his blood glucose levels. Exclusive breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of a baby developing diabetes later in life.Mothers with breast abnormalities or who have had breast surgeryStored colostrum can be helpful if you encounter problems establishing milk production.Other medical conditionsSome medical conditions may make it harder for you and your baby to establish breastfeeding. Or, if you need to start medications that are incompatible with breastfeeding, your saved colostrum can still be given to your baby.Talk to your midwifeSome NHS hospital trusts already have policies in place for sharing information on antenatal expression. Your midwife and other members of your antenatal care team may have information to share on breast massage and how to hand express. They should also be able to give you small sterile syringes with identity labels in which to save your colostrum.Do ask if the hospital has an Infant Feeding Specialist who will be well informed about breastfeeding and a source of support in those early days.A handy techniqueHand expression is a useful technique to learn even though most mothers find they rarely need to express and store their milk. It is effective, convenient and free. You may also find you can express more milk by combining hand expression with pumping than using just a pump.When to start expressingIs it safe?Don’t worry – following the suggestions to express for a few minutes each day is unlikely to trigger labour. Check with your midwife if you are at risk for early labour. If you experience any uterus cramps when expressing, stop immediately and contact your midwife.Expressing during pregnancyIt helps to be warm and relaxed.You could practise in the bath or shower at first. When you start collecting colostrum, express after a bath or shower.Wash your hands.Massage your breasts to help milk flow.Hand express from one breast. Take care NOT to cause pain or discomfort.You are likely to see small droplets or drips of colostrum appear as you express. Express directly into the container so you save every precious drop. If you’ve been given syringes and find it difficult to collect your colostrum, express into a small clean container (e.g. cup) and draw the colostrum up into the syringe.You can express up to three times in the same day. If you plan to express again that day, store the syringe in the coldest part of the fridge. This is usually at the back.Once you’ve expressed for the last time that day, seal the syringe in a bag. Label and date it before placing it in the freezer. The colostrum could be kept in the fridge if you’re going to be induced or have a planned caesarean section within a day or two. Fresh colostrum inhibits the growth of bacteria and can be safely refrigerated for 48 hours.Why hand express?Hand expression is the best way to express colostrum. It is simple to learn and gets easier with practice. You’ll only be expressing small amounts so using a pump will be impractical and may not be as effective. You may receive information and a demonstration on hand expression from your midwife.Our articleHand Expression of Breastmilkalso describes an effective method. Antenatally, you’ll only need to express for three to five minutes – just until you have a few drops of colostrum. It may not seem very much, but a baby’s first feed is no more than a teaspoon of colostrum. By expressing up to three times in a day, you can express enough for a feed. With practice and regular stimulation, you’ll be able to express more colostrum.When you go into labourTake your stored colostrum with you to the hospital in a cool bag. The hospital can arrange to keep your colostrum frozen, possibly in the special care baby unit. Make sure you or your birth partner makes a note of where it is stored and that details are in your notes.If you and your baby are likely to have difficulties or be separated, one of the containers can be defrosted once you’re close to birth. This is then ready for the first feed, if needed.When baby arrivesYour baby will need to breastfeed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours. If, for any reason, you are separated or unable to breastfeed your colostrum can be defrosted if needed, one container at a time to avoid waste. Your colostrum can also be used if your baby needs supplements.The first few daysFrequent breastfeeding and keeping your baby close by will help establish your milk supply and get breastfeeding off to a good start. If you and your baby are separated, express milk eight times in each 24 hours including at least once at night, until your baby is able to breastfeed. Expressing as well as breastfeeding is important if your baby isn’t feeding well, or needs supplements for any reason. This will help establish milk production and provide milk for your baby’s next feed if needed.

Adjusting to Motherhood,https://laleche.org.uk/adjusting-to-motherhood/,"Some mothers find  their experience of having a baby is very different from the vision of motherhood we see so much of the time. Having challenges, even feeling overwhelmed, is a normal experience.An emotional timeGet to know and enjoy your babyWhat about household responsibilities and older children?Baby bluesIn the early daysDepressionGet out and aboutLook after yourselfSpend time with other peopleAs time goes byAn emotional timeThe early weeks and months ofcaring for a new babycan be an emotional time. It can be confusing to experience the emotional ups and downs— adjusting to being a mother takes time. Pain, tiredness, your birth experience, and how much support you have can all affect how you feel. When the reality of being a mother differs from your expectations, this can add to the feeling of being on an emotional roller-coaster. As well as experiencing ‘baby blues’, most mothers have days when they feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for a new baby. The suggestions here may help you find ways of feeling more in control, however old your baby is.Get to know and enjoy your babyThe responsibility of looking after a baby 24 hours a day can be quite overwhelming at first.Try to relax—you will soon learn what he needs and enjoys. The easiest way to care for a newborn is to accept and meet his need for closeness.After a while you will find gentle patterns emerging. You can then build on these patterns, creating adaily rhythmto suit you both.Bring your baby into your room or bed to get more rest. See further reading for information on safe sleep.What about household responsibilities and older children?Some mothers plan ahead and ask for assistance with everyday household tasks, childcare, snack and meal preparation.Taking friends up on their offers of help can ease the strain.Having a list of simple tasks ready can make it easier to accept offers of help.Save your energy for vital tasks. Not all housework is equally important.Baby blues‘Baby blues’ is a mild, temporary condition associated with the falling hormone levels after birth. Around 30 to 85 percent of all new mothers experience ‘baby blues’, which usually start around 3 to 5 days after delivery.Some mothers simply find that they burst into tears for no apparent reason; others may experience mood swings, confusion, forgetfulness, headaches, negative feelings towards the baby, restlessness, irritability and nightmares. Fortunately, this condition typically lasts only a few days.In the early daysRest and sleep: It’s important to give yourself permission to rest and sleep: you have just done a major job in growing and giving birth to your baby. Try to set aside at least a week or two of recovery time.Breastfeed often: Breastfeeding and close physical contact with your newborn produces soothing hormones designed to calm you during these early days. Rigid schedules can have the opposite effect of causing more stress.Hold your baby: TryBiological Nurturing™—‘laid back’ positions can help breastfeeding go well and make you feel calmer and more confident.Spend time together: You may want to create a comfortable place for you and your baby to spend lots of time together, with as much privacy as you need.Limit visitors: It’s OK to limit visitors; you could ask your partner to explain that you’re tired or put a sign on your door ‘new mum and baby resting, please call back in a few days time’. If you’re wearing your dressing gown, or are in bed with your baby, visitors are less likely to overstay their welcome, and may even bring you a cup of tea.Plan ahead: Use an answerphone or set your mobile on silent to allow you to rest without being disturbed.DepressionIt’s very important to talk to your GP or health visitor if any of the negative feelings become intensified or if they last more than two weeks—for instance, if you feel overwhelmed, worried or cannot sleep. Depression in new mothers is not uncommon, and a lot of help is available to support mothers and their babies for whom this is a problem. If recognised and treated, mothers recover quite quickly and are then able to fully enjoy parenting their new baby.Medications are available which are safe to take while breastfeeding. Our Professional Liaison Department can give you information about whether a specific medication is safe to use while breastfeeding, contact alocal LLL breastfeeding counselloror call ourNational Telephone Helplinefor help.Homestartis a national family support charity that offers help and friendship to families with young children who are struggling to cope for whatever reason.Get out and aboutFresh air and sunshine are good for your well-being. Most mothers notice the importance of daily exercise for lifting their mood—it can be as simple as a short five to ten minute walk in the early weeks. Going out with your baby can also prevent you feeling isolated and give structure to your day.Before long you can take your baby for outings to the local park, and visits to the library and shops. Don’t try too much too soon though. Work up slowly.You could also start doing gentle, fun things with other mothers and babies eg baby massage, singing or swimming.Look after yourselfEating wisely can make a difference, including healthy snacks. Eating a well balanced diet that includes foods such as wholegrain bread and cereals, pasta, potatoes, rice, vegetables, beans and raw fruits, will help keep your blood sugar levels steady, protecting against depression and fatigue.Long-chain Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in your diet can help you cope with stress and may prevent depression. Sources include oily fish and enriched foods. Consult your doctor if you are considering taking supplements.Drink to thirst, and enough to keep your urine pale. Water is good, as is a daily glass of fruit juice. Avoid or limit alcohol, caffeine and fizzy drinks.Eating foods that include milk, bananas or complex carbohydrates before going to bed can help you sleep.Make yourself a priority when your baby sleeps: care for your own needs, including sleep and rest.The relaxation techniques you may have learnt for labour can be used now when you have a few minutes.You deserve time for yourself: make time for a bath, shower, to read a book or magazine, or watch a DVD while breastfeeding and cuddling your baby.Postnatal exercises are helpful, but avoid over-exerting yourself. Pain and tiredness can increase negative feelings.Spend time with other peopleEnjoying the company of other mothers, either face-to-face or online, can make you feel better.Local LLL meetingsare a good place to talk to other breastfeeding mothers, as are our onlineFacebook Groups. Children and Family Centres across the country also offer support and information to all parents.Seek prompt help for any breastfeeding problems, as continued pain can make you feel very low.What about talking to someone sympathetic? By talking about how you feel you may find ways of managing.Try to tell your partner what you need as it’s not always easy for others to know what you’re experiencing. Hand squeezes, hugs and positive words can go a long way.As time goes byTry to listen to your body and pace your activity to your energy level. As your baby grows, there will always be days when a rest or sleep while your baby sleeps is a good idea. Keeping up with a crawling baby or active toddler is hard work.If you’re feeling low remind yourself your baby needs you and loves you. Hold him close. He doesn’t need a perfect mother— just you.You are important too.Written by April Whincop, Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGB.
