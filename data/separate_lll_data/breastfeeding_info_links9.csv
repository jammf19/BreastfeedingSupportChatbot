Comfortable breastfeeding – quick read,https://laleche.org.uk/comfortable-breastfeeding/,"Newborn baby latched soon after birthComfortable positioning and attachment are important for all mothers. You will have time to practice with your baby while your breasts are still soft before your milk increases. The earlier you start, the easier it is. Hold your baby in skin-to-skin contact right after birth -continue this for as much time as you can during the following days and weeks.Use your baby’s natural reflexes to encourage them to latch on: skin-to-skin contact helps give your baby easy access to your breast.Find a comfortable position where you feel well supported: sitting, lying back or lying down.Avoid using pillows and cushions under your baby—use them just for your own comfort to support your head, shoulders, body, arms and legs.Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby. Relax comfortably with your breast in its natural position. Your body can support your baby so your arms don’t take all their weight.Baby is in full body contact with their mother’s bodyWhen your baby’s whole front is in close contact with your body their movements will be more coordinated. They can search for your breast with a little help and encouragement from you. It helps your baby if their feet are resting against something firm like your thigh or hand.It’s normal for a baby to bob at the breast and lick the nipple. These are signs that he is preparing to latch on.Help your baby approach your breast ‘nose to nipple’ with their chin on or close to the breast and their head tipped back a little.  It’s surprising how far away from your nipple your baby’s mouth seems to be to achieve a good latch. As they latch on they will take a big mouthful of breast.Baby is nose to nipple, leading with the chinTheir lower jaw will be tucked into your breast well away from the base of your nipple and their nose will be free.  Keep their body tucked in close as they attach and feed but don’t push the back of their head— they needs to be able to move their head freely.Baby is supported at the shoulders. The back of their neck is freeTo help them swallow comfortably check their head is inline with their body, not turned to one side.  Once your baby is attached, settle back for comfort and pull your baby’s whole body in close.The natural or laid-back breastfeeding positions shown in the following video can be a great help in encouraging your baby to latch on well, as well as being comfortable for you. You can lean back comfortably with your baby on top of you with their whole front against you and their body completely supported by yours:This video demonstrates how to enable your baby to latch deeply on to your breast. This will help breastfeeding be comfortable for you and means your baby get enough milk:First breastfeedsBreastfeed early and often after your baby’s birth to minimise engorgement (uncomfortably swollen breasts). If he latches on well and you are comfortable he will get plenty of practice and will probably continue to feed well after your milk ‘comes in’ and your breasts feel fuller. If feeding is uncomfortable, seek help immediately.Later onMothers often say it takes a few weeks for breastfeeding to feel totally comfortable and natural, even if they have breastfed before. And as your baby grows in length and weight you’ll need to adjust how you support them. However you sit or lie, try to keep their whole front firmly against yours in a position that encourages them to extend their neck and sink their chin and lower lip firmly into your breast as they latch. Relax back a little and let your body support more of their weight. You baby’s bottom can rest on your hip or be pulled in against you with your elbow.CHINSMany people now use the nmemonic CHINS to help with comfortable breastfeedingC = close:Baby is ascloseto you as possible so that it does not need to reach for the breast.H = head:Baby’sheadis tilted so that the baby has its head at the right angle so the breast enters the mouth at the right angle to reach the comfortable place where your nipple will not be damaged.I = In Line:Your baby’s body isin a linefrom, head to shoulders and hips (you would not drink a cup of tea with it sitting on your shoulder!)N= Nose to nipple: This means baby is lifting up to the breast and the nipple is in the right place to enter the mouth comfortably This means you can then bring your baby in to the breast quickly to latch. They may even latch on their own, just by putting them in the right place.S =Your position issustainable.Seek supportIf you are finding it difficult to get comfortable you can contact a LLL Leader by calling ourHelpline. You can also find support and encouragement from breastfeeding mothers in yourlocal LLL group.If your baby won’t breastfeedDon’t panic! Some babies take a while to get around to nursing and by keeping your baby in skin-to-skin contact you are encouraging them to start feeding. A baby usually starts to suck spontaneously if they can snuggle up close to your bare chest for periods of time. Laid-back or natural breastfeeding positions usually stimulate a baby’s instinct to attach and suckle well at the breast. In such positions, babies can also latch on when sleepy or in light sleep. Watch for signs that your baby is stirring and gently encourage feeding.  See alsoMy Baby Won’t Breastfeed.And you may also find this article helpful:Getting breastfeeding back on track after a difficult birth.Supporting your breast?Your breast needs to rest at its natural level. If supporting it with your hand, keep your fingers well back from the areola and don’t be tempted to lift your breast and push it into your baby’s mouth. Sometimes shaping your breast slightly to match the oval of their mouth can help. Or experiment with the reclining positions shown here as these reduce the need to hold your baby leaving you with both hands free to help them latch.Written by Sue Upstone, Amanda Dunbar and mothers of LLLGB.Photos courtesy of Lois Rowlands, Suzanne Tobin and others who have kindly allowed us to use their photos.Further readingPositioning and attachmentBeginning Breastfeeding – easy readInverted Nipples?My baby won’t breastfeedNipple painGetting breastfeeding back on track after a difficult start – the three keepsBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Working and Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/working-and-breastfeeding/,"Many mothers work outside the home and continue to breastfeed.

Do I need to stop breastfeeding?Why is breastfeeding so important?But won’t it be a hassle?What are my options?Choose childcare carefullyConsider expressing your milkSolid foodsMaking it workSomewhere to expressBefore you return to workExpressingWorking and breastfeedingFurther readingI’m going back to work. Do I need to stop breastfeeding?There is no need to stop breastfeeding when you return to work. Returning to paid work doesn’t prevent you from breastfeeding your baby. Depending on the nature of your job and the age of your baby, you’ll probably need to adjust your nursing relationship. You’ll also need to talk to your employer, but time away from your little one doesn’t mean breastfeeding has to end. Continuing to nurse may be even more important to you both as you adjust to big changes in your lives.  Mothers choose to continue breastfeeding for their babies’ health and because breastfeeding is good for the whole family. It provides easy feeding on days at home and a warm way to reconnect at the end of a long day for mother and child. It’s well worth planning how to balance breastfeeding with your work routine.Why is breastfeeding so important?Your milk alone is vital to your baby during the first six months of life, and continues to be an important part of his diet until 12 months and beyond. Formula just doesn’t compare. As well as meeting nutritional needs, breastmilk is packed with antibodies—particularly important if your little one will be spending time in nursery or with a childminder. And when you are together, making time to reconnect through snuggling up and nursing will be even more meaningful. You’ll miss each other when you’re apart.But won’t it be a hassle?Being a working mother will be challenging, but breastfeeding can make life easier. Ending the breastfeeding relationship may appear at first to be the simplest solution, but with the increased risk of illness, plus the effort involved in buying, preparing and storing formula, weaning may ultimately be the real hassle. Also consider that your baby will eventually outgrow the need to nurse. Most mothers reduce and stop pumping before their babies stop breastfeeding.What are my options?Your options depend on the age of your baby and the nature of your job. You can start planning before your baby is born. Gather ideas from any co-workers who breastfed their babies. Studies show that the longer you wait before returning to work, the easier the transition will be for both you and your baby.Consider your employment flexibility andworkday practicalities:Can you extend your maternity leave, request part-time or flexible working hours, or an extended lunch hour?Are you able to work from home for all or some of the time, or even bring your baby to work?Can you break up your working week, perhaps working alternate days, so your baby is not away from you several days in a row?Shorter workdays may be easier to manage, with less pumping for you and fewer missed breastfeeds for your baby.Or you may prefer fewer but longer workdays, with more full days at home with your baby.Choose childcare carefullyHaving your baby nearby may allow you to go and nurse him during your lunch hour. Or maybe someone could bring him to you? Look for carers who are supportive of and knowledgeable about breastfeeding. It’s important they respect your decision to provide only your milk for your baby.Consider expressing your milkYou can use a good quality electric pump or learn to hand express. This is especially important if your baby is less than a year old.Expressing milkwill enable you to maintain milk production as well as ensuring your baby can still receive your milk whilst you’re apart. If you decide not to express your milk at work you can still continue breastfeeding when you’re at home. You may need to express at first to avoid the discomfort of engorgement and the risk ofmastitis.Solid foodsOnce your baby is eating more solid foods, he will need less expressed milk while you are away. But your baby will enjoy your yummy milk once you get home again!Making it workI don’t want to wean, but I’m sure my employer will want me to!This is one time when your employer can’t tell you what to do! Daunting as it may seem, it’s important to tell your employer about your need to express milk for your baby. Depending on what is available in your workplace, you may find it helpful to speak to someone from the human resources department, a health and safety representative and/or your trade union representative before speaking to your line manager. Employers are legally required to do a health and safety risk assessment for breastfeeding mothers, so you’ll need to notify them in writing a few weeks before you return to work. Explain that being able to pump regularly will reduce any risk of you becoming engorged and developing mastitis.Research shows it’s a win-win situation if breastfeeding is supported and therefore continues: you’ll feel positive about your company and your job satisfaction will increase—along with your willingness to work hard! Your employer will gain from your hard work and, because your baby will have breastmilk’s infection protection, you’re likely to take less time off.For more information on your rights, and what employers are required to do to support you, see:Maternity Action and their guidance on Breastfeeding at WorkACAS: accommodating breastfeeding in the workplaceThe Health & Safety Executive: Protecting pregnant workers and new mothersSomewhere to expressYou’ll want to request somewhere private to express your milk, preferably with a door that can be locked. It helps to have access to electricity for your pump, a fridge and running water. A comfortable place to sit and a table for your pump and other supplies are also important. Bathrooms and toilets are not suitable. Employers are legally required to provide suitable facilities for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to “rest”. Although, they are not required by law to provide a private and safe place to express andstore milk, the Health and Safety Executive recommend that they do. All employers must carry out a risk assessment so it would be very difficult for them to refuse.  Be very clear about what you want to do and what you need. And do point out that expressing is something that, depending on the age of your baby, you may only need to do for a few months.Before you return to workAttendLLL meetingsto meet other breastfeeding mothers in your area. You can offer each other vital support when breastfeeding, pumping, mothering or working becomes challenging.Practise pumping or hand expressing to learn what works for you. You can freeze the small amounts of milk you collect to use for your first few days back at work and to give you a small back-up supply. Once you’re missing feeds, the amount of milk you can pump will incre se and your baby can have fresh milk from the previous workday. Fresh milk retains more nutrients and immune factors.Wait to introduce a bottle until just before you start back to work. Making breastfeeding a priority while you are at home will help you avoid feeding problems. An older baby may never need a bottle. Milk can be given in a cup or mixed with solid food.Make your return to work easier by starting back on a Thursday or Friday. At the weekend, rest and prepare for any challenges you didn’t anticipate. Make changes if your first strategy doesn’t suit you or your baby.ExpressingIt’s usually best toexpress milkat least every three hours while you are away from your baby. You may need to pump or express your milk more frequently at first so you don’t feel uncomfortably full or start to leak. Be sure to include commuting time when deciding how often to pump. If you feel the tingling of your milk beginning to flow, pressing hard on your nipples for several seconds can prevent leaking. This can be done discreetly by crossing your arms tightly across your chest and pressing firmly on your nipples with the palms of your hands. Hold for a few seconds before releasing and all should be well. If it doesn’t work first time, try again for a little longer. But bear in mind that if your breasts feel full, this is a sign you need to express some milk. With time you’ll have fewer problems with leaking.Working and breastfeedingIt can be so rewarding to continue to nurse your baby after returning to work. It’s a wonderful way of reconnecting after a day apart. LLL meetings can continue to be a good source of support after you return to work. If you’re unable to attend everymeeting, yourlocal LLL Leadercan still listen to any concerns you have and offer support.Written by Sue Upstone & Mothers of LLLGB.Further readingWorking and BreastfeedingWorkday practicalitiesIf you leave your babyWhen mum can’t be thereExpressing your breastmilkHand expression of breastmilkMy Journey Returning To Work, a mother’s storyMothers on … breastfeeding & workBooksThe Womanly Art of BreastfeedingLLLI. London: Pinter & Martin, 2010.Exclusively Pumping BreastmilkStephanie Casemore.

How lovely to have precious nursing time together at home. If you feel guilt or conflict about returning to work, continuing to breastfeed will help you feel you’re stilldoing the very best you can for your little one.Returning to work will be hard work whichever way you feed your baby. Sitting down to breastfeed lets you rest and recharge.The evening beforePrepare the day before to help mornings go smoothly—pack your baby’s nappy bag, make a packed lunch, prepare your pump and check that everyone’s clothes are ready.Getting outSet your alarm for a feed just before you get up, so your baby is content while you dress and get ready. Then nurse him again just before you leave. You’ll start the day with comfortable breasts and your baby well-fed.Coming homeIf possible, breastfeed as soon as you collect your baby. When you get home, plan to have a drink and a snack and nurse or play with your baby for a while.  Lying down to nurse and even having a nap may help you cope with the evening rush. Cuddles and a chat over a snack can also help you reconnect with older children. Everyone will be happier if you and your baby are more relaxed, even if dinner ends up a little later.TearsBabies and children often save up their frustrations until the person they trust most is available. It’s normal for a baby to fuss and cry more than usual when his mother collects him. Accepting your baby’s emotions is usually more helpful than trying to force independenceCommon concernsLeakingPump at work and breastfeed frequently at home to keep up your milk production.  After any non-working days when you’ve been nursing your baby, you will probably experience more leaking and be able to pump more milk. If you feel the tingling of your milk letting down, fold your arms tightly across your chest and press firmly on your nipples for several seconds to stop milk flow. Some breast pads also work this way to prevent leaking. But full breasts are a sign to express some milk.  You’ll probably have fewer problems with leaking after a few days at work, but be able to pump less milk. It’s also common to be able to express more milk in the morning than in the afternoon.Blocked ductsListen to your body. To avoid problems with blocked ducts and mastitis, express frequently enough to keep your breasts soft and comfortable while you are away from your baby. Full breasts reduce milk production.Nurse often when togetherThe more often your baby gets to nurse when you are together, the less milk you’ll need to pump when away. Be prepared for more evening, night-time and early morning feeds—this reverse-cycle nursing is common. If you keep your baby with you in the evening they can nurse frequently before bed and you may get fewer night-time awakenings.Co-sleepingFor part or all of the night can make it easier to sleep whilst meeting your baby’s need for closeness.Boosting milk productionKeep an emergency supply of frozen expressed breastmilk. Take prompt steps to increase your milk production if you need to dip into your supply. A ‘babymoon’ day, afternoon or evening with your baby, resting and breastfeeding frequently, can really boost your milk supply. Be aware that medications such as decongestants and the contraceptive pill can lower milk production. You may also notice a temporary drop in milk during your menstrual periods.  If your baby is over six months it can help if the caregiver gives them any solid foods and other drinks whilst you are away, as this may reduce the amount of milk you need to pump. You can then concentrate on nursing when you’re at home.FatigueYour biggest problem will probably be tiredness.Getting enough rest and early nights can help you cope. Use days at home to recharge—take things slowly and have an afternoon nap if needed.Use breastfeeding and pumping sessions as rest times—a chance to sit or lie down and relax.Find ways to take short breaks during your day, using any unexpected opportunities.Establish priorities for what needs doing at home and share responsibilities with your partner, older children and others.Pace yourself, and reserve your time and energy for the most important tasks.Try to fit in a little fresh air and exercise such as a regular walk. Some errands may be nearly as quick on foot as by car.Regular mealsEating regular and nutritious meals will help sustain you. Drink according to your thirst. Avoid using caffeine drinks (coffee, tea, cola) to keep you going.Reducing stressRunning late is a common cause of stress. If you leave home in plenty of time to get to your caregiver’s, you can spend a few minutes settling and nursing your baby before leaving for work. Consider having a flexible arrangement with your caregiver in case you run late at the end of the day. Paying for 15 minutes extra childcare may reduce your stress levels, even if you rarely use it.  Plan backup childcare options in case your baby is ill. You or your partner may have to take a day’s leave, one of you may have to work from home, or your baby could go to family or a friend whom he knows well.When you feel overwhelmedRemember that what you are going through is because you are a working mother. It’s work that’s tiring—  breastfeeding makes being a mother easier. Developing a support network of like-minded mothers gives you people to turn to when needed.  The hardest part of returning to work is missing your baby. Be kind to yourself, especially when you start back. Nursing, carrying your baby in a sling or backpack and sleeping with him nearby can all help you compensate for the time apart.Many of the challenges you’ll experience are shared with all mothers, including getting necessary jobs done with a crawling baby or active toddler. Being flexible will help you cope with what each day brings when your baby is into everything.  Avoid doing everything at home in addition to your paid job. Discuss with your partner  and older children how the jobs at home can be more equally shared. Use this as chance for everyone to learn new skills and become more independent.“Breastfeeding simplifies many things for me, plus it helps to ensure that when I am at home, I am spending time with my baby.”Make time for yourselfMake time to relax and enjoy your favourite hobbies. Use your baby’s nursing or nap times to give you a chance to read, play music or do a craft. A sling or backpack can also help for gardening or other activities you enjoy. Babies and toddlers can play close by too and may enjoy watching or joining in with your interesting activities.Keep breastfeeding options openOnce back at work, you can always make changes if you find things aren’t working out as planned. However, if you decide to stop breastfeeding before you return to work, it can be difficult to reverse this decision later on.Breastfeeding doesn’t last foreverAt some point your baby will outgrow the need to nurse. And well before then you will be able to reduce and stop expressing milk whilst away. You will both benefit physically and emotionally from ending breastfeeding gradually.LLL meetingscan continue to be a good source of support after you return to work. If you’re unable to attend every meeting, yourlocal LLL Leadercan still listen to any concerns you have and offer support.Written by Sue Upstone and mothers of LLLGB.Further ReadingExpressing your milkIf you leave your babyStoring your milkWhen mum can’t be thereWorking and breastfeedingYou can buy this information in printed form from our shophereYou may also wish to look at the following guidance:Maternity Action and their guidance on Breastfeeding at WorkACAS: accommodating breastfeeding in the workplaceThe Health & Safety Executive: Protecting pregnant workers and new mothers"
When Mum Can’t Be There,https://laleche.org.uk/when-mum-cant-be-there/,"“Mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural and effective way of understanding and satisfying the needs of the baby.” – La Leche League InternationalNature intended mothers and babies to stay together as much as possible because breastfeeding is the normal way to care for a baby – providing him with the comfort and security of his mother’s presence as well as with milk. It also helps protect him from any infections he may come into contact with. Babies and separation“In the early years the baby has an intense need to be with his mother, which is as basic as his need for food.”–La Leche League InternationalA breastfed baby’s ‘primary attachment figure’ is likely to be his mother. Separation from her will be distressing for him unless he is in the care of another person with whom he has already formed an attachment, such as a family member or friend. Being left with a stranger, however kind and caring that person may be, is frightening for a young child. Many babies and toddlers show distress at separation by becoming upset or misbehaving. Others become quiet, withdrawn or may sleep a lot.It’s important to know that a quiet baby is suppressing his emotions and is in need of intensive care and attention just as much as a baby who cries or protests his distress. These behaviours are less likely when a baby knows and trusts his carer. Before a baby you will be caring for is left with you, allow as much time as possible for him to form an attachment to you whilst still in the presence of his mother. Once the baby has got to know you, the next step could be you caring for him for a short time and, when he is comfortable with this, long enough for him to be offered a single feed. A breastfed baby is more likely to allow someone else to feed him if his mum isn’t present.Breastfeeding ConsiderationsFood and DrinkSleepCaring for the Breastfed BabyExpressed BreastmilkFeeding OptionsHow much milk?How often?ReassuranceInfant formulaIf bottles are usedAlso tryBreastfeeding ConsiderationTry to keep separation as short as possible at first, especially for a very young baby. It helps if the baby’s mother can nurse just before she leaves and immediately she returns. A full baby and comfortable breasts make for a good start. Avoid offering a large amount of milk or other foods shortly before a baby’s mother is due to return – a mum will probably need to feed her baby as soon as she arrives if her breasts are feeling full. Breastfeeding is the perfect way for mother and baby to reconnect after time apart. There are huge benefits if a mother can see and nurse her baby part-way through longer separations. For the mother, it reduces her need to express milk while she’s away and she may not leak as much. Her baby will benefit from contact with his mum and need fewer feeds while he’s with you, making looking after him easier.Food and DrinkBreastfed babies are often very good at moderating their intake of food and drink and not taking more than they need. A happy baby is more likely to take any food and drink that is available than go hungry or thirsty. If a baby is eating solid foods, this will help if he is reluctant to take much expressed breastmilk. Many foods contain water, especially fruits. It’s also possible to offer expressed milk mixed with solid foods. Some babies are happier to take a drink if it is given with solids, so a drink with a small snack may be an option in between mealtimes. Bear in mind that current guidelines recommend that healthy full term babies are not offered solid foods until around six months of age. Nowadays mothers often allow their babies to feed themselves instead of spoon-feeding them.SleepBreastfed babies often fall asleep at the breast, and may find it difficult to go to sleep alone. Mothers may encourage their babies to sleep when they need to rather than having set times for naps. Being cuddled and rocked, carried in a sling or perhaps taken for a walk in a pushchair can help a baby ease into sleep when he’s showing signs of tiredness.Caring for the Breastfed BabyA baby can be offered breastmilk in several ways depending on his age, what he finds comfortable and his mother’s preferences. Many breastfed babies never have a bottle – even when separated from their mothers.Expressed BreastmilkA mother’s own milk is the best possible food to help her baby grow and develop and is full of antibodies, live cells, and other substances to protect him from infection.Expressed breastmilkis remarkably resilient and stores well due to its antibacterial properties. Comprehensive information on how to store breastmilk is available on our pagehere.Feeding OptionsUsing either an open cup or a baby beaker with a simple spout (no valves) is an option for a baby from three months old. A younger baby can be fed his mother’s milk using a small flexible plastic cup, medicine cup or spoon filled half-full. Swaddle the baby in a blanket if needed and hold him upright in your lap. Rest the cup gently on his lower lip and tip it so a small amount of milk touches his lips. This will encourage him to extend his tongue to lap the milk. Don’t pour milk into his mouth. Leave the cup in position as he swallows, then offer again. Let the baby set the pace, lapping the milk. An oral/medicine syringe (ask for one in your local pharmacy) can also be used to drip milk slowly into his mouth just inside his lower lip or gum, so he has chance to taste then swallow without choking.How much milk?It’s difficult to determine how much milk to expect a breastfed baby to take when separated from his mother. Much will depend on his age, how well-fed he is beforehand and for how long he is left. If you care for a baby regularly you will soon get a good idea of how much he usually takes. There’s evidence that fully breastfed babies require less milk than formula fed babies—as much as 25% fewer calories at four months. Most breastfed babies take between 60–120ml (2–4oz) about 8 to 10 times per day. It’s unlikely that a breastfed baby would take 240ml (8oz) of breastmilk at one feed.  It can be useful to tell the mother how much milk the baby takes so she can leave enough milk next time. Don’t be surprised if the baby doesn’t drink much milk whilst in your care. A baby may adapt to his mother’s working hours, taking very little milk from his caregiver and then nursing very frequently when his mum is around and this is perfectly normal.How Often?If you’re used to feeding babies to a routine, learning about feeding cues may help. Fussing, rooting and fist sucking are all early signs of hunger. A nursing baby is used to feeding frequently so offer his mother’s milk quickly, before he gets frantic with hunger—little and often works well for most breastfed babies.ReassuranceA nursing mum and baby will find it hard to be apart from one another. The separation will be so much easier on both if the baby has formed an attachment to you and his mother knows she can trust that you’ll do your best to meet his needs whilst she’s away.Infant formulaIf the baby’s mother leaves powdered infant formula, you need to follow NHS guidelines for its preparation carefully, as it is not a sterile product. The NHS leaflet, Bottle feeding, provides information on making up each formula feed fresh using water at 70°C. Cool the bottle of formula to body temperature before giving it to the baby. Anything used to give infant formula needs to be washed in hot, soapy water and sterilised so artificial feeding is as safe as possible. Never give infant formula to a baby without his mother’s permission. Infant formula, given when not essential to meet a baby’s nutritional needs can encourage an unnecessary end to breastfeeding. It can also put a baby’s health at risk and may have social and financial implications. Whilst a decision to stop breastfeeding is reversible, the practicalities of re-lactation aren’t always easy. NHS leaflet: Bottle feeding is available from health visitors and online at:Unicef – Resources for Parents – DoH Bottle Feeding LeafletIf bottles are usedBottles can confuse breastfed babies, as nursing at the breast is different from sucking a bottle. Once breastfeeding is well established this is less likely to be a problem, though some breastfed babies will not take a bottle. The following tips can help a breastfed baby take a bottle with the least effect on breastfeeding.Choose a teat with a small hole to help prevent the baby being overwhelmed with milk.Offer a bottle before he is too hungry. Watch for early feeding cues.Cuddle him in a fairly upright position, supporting his neck and head if needed.Encourage the baby to open wide by placing the teat across his upper and lower lips and with its tip at the ridge between the upper lip and nose.Give him some control by allowing him to take the bottle teat into his mouth himself.Avoid just pushing the teat in.Tip the bottle just enough to give a gentle flow so the baby is not overwhelmed with milk. As the bottle empties, gradually tip the bottle more.Encourage frequent pauses to mimic breastfeeding by tilting the bottle just enough to stop the flow. Allow the baby to decide when he has had enough. Different feeding positions can help:Holding the baby in his usual nursing position.Supporting him against your raised legs.Holding him with his back to your chest.Also tryWrapping him in something that smells of mum.Moving rhythmically – rocking, walking, or swaying from side-to-side while feeding him.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of LLLGB.

When a Mother is Ill,https://laleche.org.uk/when-a-mother-is-ill/,"When a mother is ill, it affects the whole family. For a breastfeeding mother, there are additional concerns about how her illness may affect her baby, whether directly because of any medication she needs to take, or indirectly if the illness makes it more difficult for her to feed and care for her baby.Balancing risksMedications and breastmilkCommon illnessesLess common conditionsHospitalisationHaving surgery?AnaestheticsRecoveryIf weaning is advisedBalancing risksWhilst there may be a risk if you continue to breastfeed while taking a medication, it’s important to be well informed about the medication and to balance these with the risks of stopping breastfeeding — even temporarily. Substituting infant formula can be risky for a baby as it will deprive him of the antibodies and immune factors that help protect him from illness. Where there is a family history of allergy a baby may have an increased risk of developing asthma or eczema when exposed to infant formula.For a breastfed baby nursing is more than just food — it’s love and comfort too. So caring for your baby and keeping him happy without being able to breastfeed is likely to be difficult for everyone concerned. And if abrupt weaning causes overfull breasts, blocked ducts or mastitis, this will compound your problems.Medications and breastmilkGenerally, a medication that is safe for babies is the best choice for a breastfeeding mother. In any case, watching for any side effects in a baby is always a sensible precaution.Usually, when a mother takes a medication, her baby receives a much smaller amount through breastfeeding than he would during pregnancy. However, medications that are considered safe during pregnancy may not necessarily be compatible with breastfeeding. A pregnant mother’s liver and kidneys may detoxify and excrete a medication before it reaches her baby through the placenta. After birth a breastfed baby must process the medication on his own once it has reached his bloodstream.Many medications can safely be taken by breastfeeding mothers. Some medications don’t pass into a mother’s milk, some are not absorbed from a baby’s digestive tract, and for some there is a long history of safe use by nursing mothers. However, it’s wise to check with your doctor or pharmacist as certain medications can cause problems.Consider the following points when making decisions:Premature and newborn babies are the most likely to be affected by medications. After one month of age most babies are better able to handle certain medications.A heavier baby will be less affected by a medication he receives through his mother’s milk than a lighter baby of the same age.A baby who is receiving solid foods or formula as well as breastmilk will probably receive less of the medication than one who is exclusively breastfeeding. A breastfeeding toddler who nurses infrequently will receive less of the medication than a toddler who nurses more often.A medication taken for weeks or months may have a greater potential impact on a breastfed baby than one that is taken for only a few days.The level of a medication in a mother’s milk can vary according to the time between taking the medication and the next breastfeed.It is always wise to check over-the counter medications. Although paracetamol and ibuprofen are considered compatible with breastfeeding some medications, like aspirin, are not safe for babies. Others, such as cold and flu remedies, can cause sleepiness and reduce your milk production. Medications with only one active ingredient may be a better choice than compound medications.For up-to-date information on medications when breastfeeding, see theDrug FactSheets from the Breastfeeding Network.Health concerns and illnessesAn LLL Leader can help you find more information on breastfeeding with particular illnesses and health conditions, and support you as you consider options.Common illnessesCommon colds, flu and stomach bugs can be hard to cope with while breastfeeding— particularly if you don’t feel like eating. Even if you can’t eat, try to keep up your fluid intake to prevent dehydration. You will continue to make milk for your baby, though if you feel very ill it may seem as though you are producing less milk. Continuing to breastfeed whenever your baby is interested will help maintain milk production while you are ill and increase it afterwards if needed.There is no need to stay apart from your baby—he will already have been exposed to the illness before you realised you were ill. Continuing to breastfeed gives him valuable protection against the effects of your illness. Sensible hygiene precautions such as using tissues and binning them immediately, and washing hands with soap and water or using hand cleansers can help reduce transmission of illness.Less common conditionsIf you have contracted a less common illness, such as chickenpox, impetigo or Herpes simplex you will want to know how it will affect you and your baby. Your midwife, health visitor, GP or hospital consultant can give you detailed medical information about your illness and how to minimize risks of transmission.Mental health concernsSince mothers often experience depression, a lot of information is available on medications and breastfeeding. It is usually possible to find appropriate treatment that can be taken while breastfeeding. With prompt treatment mothers recover quite quickly and are then able to fully enjoy parenting their new baby. And breastfeeding helps maintain the important bond between mother and baby even if a mother is depressed.Chronic health concernsIf you have a chronic health condition or illness, such as asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy or thyroid disease, you may have concerns about how – or if – this will affect your feeding preferences. In most cases, with the right support and information, breastfeeding is possible. You may even find that nursing is the simplest way to feed your baby.If you choose to breastfeed your baby – including exclusively expressing or combi feeding – LLL Leaders are available to support you by listening to your needs and your baby’s needs. We can help you to find breastfeeding solutions which work for you and make decisions that are right for you and your family.Contact your local Leader (breastfeeding counsellor) or LLL grouphere.HospitalisationIf you need to spend time in hospital you will naturally have concerns about separation from your baby. First consider whether the treatment could be delayed until your baby is older, or takeplace with you as an outpatient. Explain to your health care professionals that not being able to breastfeed or express milk will put you at risk of painfully overfull breasts, blocked ducts, mastitis and a reduction in your milk production and ask for access to your baby or to a pump to be written into your careplan.Having surgery?Make clear to your partner and health care team on the day that if you are not alert enough to breastfeed after the operation they will need to help you express your milk. If you can’t keep your baby with you whilst in hospital, ask that your partner or whoever is looking after your baby be able to bring your baby in before and after the procedure so you can breastfeed. This is likely to be much easier and more restful for you than expressing.Hope for the best—plan for the worstEven if you can breastfeed in hospital, planning for the possibility that you might not will help you cope. If you are going to be apart from your baby, you’ll need to make arrangements to express your milk. It may not be easy to gain regular access to hospital pumps so it’s a good idea to learn to hand express and/or take in your own or a rented pump. If the pump requires electricity, the hospital electricians may be required to test it for safety before you can plug it in. For a planned hospital stay ask to have it tested in advance. You might also practice expressing beforehand.Your baby’s needsYour baby will miss you so if you know you will be apart, try to find a carer whom your baby already knows and loves eg his daddy or a grandparent. If possible, express and freeze milk in the weeks beforehand so you have an emergency supply for your baby.AnaestheticsMedications used for local and general anaesthesia do not remain in a mother’s system or affect her milk. It is safe to breastfeed as soon as you are alert enough to handle your baby. For planned treatment ask in advance for detailed information on which drugs you will need to take and on pre-op procedures such as fasting. Request post-op pain relief medication that is compatible with breastfeeding. To help you cope with fasting prior to a medical procedure avoid tea, coffee and salty foods and eat well and drink plenty of water the day before. Don’t be surprised if you find it difficult to express much milk during the hours leading up to your operation. Afterwards, milk production will pick up very quickly with frequent breastfeeding.After any operation, try to organise as much help as possible with meals, household tasks etc. Depending on how you are feeling, you may even appreciate someone helping you care for your baby. Plan complete rest for the first 24 hours and then take things easy for at least a week.RecoveryThe important thing for any mother after any illness is taking time to recuperate. Be wary of trying to do too much too soon. Eating and drinking, rest and relaxation will help both your recovery and, combined with frequent nursing, your milk production.If your baby is fussy at the breast you may be concerned about whether you are making enough milk. Encourage your baby to breastfeed frequently and offer both sides to give your breasts the message to boost milk production—you’ll probably notice a difference within just a day or two. You may find breastfeeding while lying down lets you rest and nurse your baby. If you are groggy from medications, ask whoever is looking after you to help keep your baby safe. If you still don’t feel like eating much, try frequent small meals or snacks and sips of juice. Try a night-time snack and drink until your normal appetite returns.If weaning is advisedEnforced weaning is not easy on either mother or child so if you are told to stop  breastfeeding your baby because of a medical condition or medication, it’s normal to feel overwhelmed and upset. Do contact an LLL Leader to discuss the options—she can access information on individual medications if needed. Whilst each medication needs to be checked individually, many are compatible with breastfeeding. For a short course of treatment, temporary weaning may be an option. To minimize discomfort and maintain milk production you will need to express or pump your milk frequently instead of nursing, discarding it until your treatment is completed. You can then re-establish breastfeeding.Nursing is more than just a method of feeding. It’s also a familiar source of closeness and comfort. So if weaning really is necessary try to end breastfeeding as gradually as time allows, giving your baby lots of love and extra attention. You can hand express or use a pump to reduce your milk production gradually. This will help keep your breasts comfortable and slow down hormonal changes.

The Unhappy Breastfed baby,https://laleche.org.uk/unhappy-baby/,"“The newborn baby has only three demands. They are warmth in the arms of its mother, food from her breasts and security in the knowledge of her presence. Breastfeeding satisfies all three.”~ Dr Grantly Dick-Read fromBirthing Without FearThis simple recipe for keeping a baby happy works for the majority of breastfeeding families. But a few babies remain unhappy despite their parents’ efforts to meet their needs.It can be worrying if your baby is unsettled, uncomfortable, distressed or in pain. If he is being sick, experiencing diarrhoea or has other symptoms, this may add to your concerns. Babies can be unsettled for many reasons and it can sometimes take time and effort to work out the cause.You may worry that your baby’s symptoms are caused by something either of you has eaten. While it’s true that food allergy or intolerance could be the cause it is wise to consider other possibilities first. When your baby’s behaviour shows that something is not right it’s important to keep searching until you find a solution that makes both of you feel better.Hunger – or some other source?Comfort techniquesNot enough breastmilkOversupply or forceful flowThrush in a baby’s mouthReflux diseasePyloric stenosisDiarrhoea due to a stomach upsetLactose intoleranceCongenital disordersAllergy and food intoleranceHunger – or some other cause?Delaying or scheduling feeds will make most babies unhappy— responding to your baby’s fussiness by breastfeeding (offering both breasts if needed) and/or carrying him will ensure that he is comforted and not hungry. It is normal for a baby to want to nurse around 8–12 times each 24 hours.Comfort techniques for unhappy babiesIf your baby isn’t comforted by breastfeeding you may find carrying him in a sling or soft carrier helps. Research shows that babies who are carried more tend to cry much less. And even if your baby doesn’t settle, he will at least know that someone cares enough to be with him while he’s unhappy. Sometimes the colic hold can relieve abdominal discomfort.Care for an unhappy baby isn’t easy—try to minimize outside demands so you can concentrate on your baby’s needs. Enlist your partner’s support in taking care of you both—sometimes the difference can be just what is needed.SeeI think my baby’s got colicfor more information..The colic hold:The ‘colic hold’ can be useful for comforting an unhappy babyNot enough breastmilkYour baby could be fussy because he is not getting enough milk. In this case he may not show steady weight gain. As weekly weight gain can vary, average your baby’s weight gain over several weeks.Check he is well attached at the breast, and offer both breasts at least 8–12 times every 24 hours. Keep an eye on nappies too. After the first four days, expect at least 6–8 wet and 3–5 dirty nappies in 24 hours.  These should be yellow, loose unformed poos at least the size of a 2p coin. From about six weeks, some babies have less frequent but abundant poos.SeeIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?for more information.Oversupply or forceful flowWhen a mother is producing too much milk, her baby may often bring up milk, be very windy and want to nurse a lot. He may suffer with colic, and be fussy at the breast, arching away when the milk starts flowing. Rather than the typical yellow poos of a breastfed baby, his may be green and frothy—occasionally or all the time.With oversupply, a baby is likely to be gaining weight very fast, as much as 400g in a week. A baby coping with an oversupply of milk may mistakenly be diagnosed with lactose intolerance or reflux—but the problem can be overcome by attention to positioning and attachment, and by ensuring that he takes a full feed from one breast before switching to the other.SeeToo much milk and oversupplyfor more information.Thrush in baby’s mouthA baby may have thrush in his mouth. Mothers can also have painful nipple thrush. The main symptoms are fussy nursing because of a sore mouth and sore, itchy, burning nipples. A baby may  also have nappy rash.Thrush can cause windiness and slow weight gain because a baby doesn’t nurse as well as usual. When a mother or baby takes antibiotics, their risk of thrush increases.SeeThrushfor more information.Reflux diseaseA baby with gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has a weakness in the tissue around the opening between the oesophagus and the stomach, allowing the stomach contents to move back up into his throat. Symptoms include vomiting, colicky crying and sudden waking at night.Because babies with reflux often associate food with pain, refusal to nurse and slow weight gain are common. Reflux is more common and severe in babies who are not breastfed.SeeRefluxfor more information.Pyloric stenosisThis is a narrowing of the muscular wall of the tube between the stomach and small intestine. The symptoms of pyloric stenosis generally appear between 2 and 6 weeks with increasing frequency of possetting, or projectile vomiting, along with poor weight gain.If projectile vomiting occurs every day consult your doctor, as your baby may need medication or even surgery to resolve the problem.Diarrhoea due to a stomach upsetA baby or toddler with diarrhoea due to illness has 12–16 watery, smelly poos per day, which have no substance. A baby may also have other signs of illness, including fever or vomiting. Even after the illness is over, a baby or toddler who is otherwise well can have continuing diarrhoea, with loose poos, while his gut heals.If your baby has diarrhoea it is important to continue breastfeeding, offering frequent, small feeds.Lactose intoleranceLactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose (milk sugar), not an allergy to milk, though it can have similar symptoms. Lactose intolerance occurs when an individual doesn’t make enough lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose in the intestine.Although it can occur in adults, lactose intolerance is very rare in young children. This makes sense as breastmilk, the food on which they depend, is extremely rich in lactose. In populations in which lactose intolerance is common, the ability to produce lactase generally declines gradually and symptoms increase gradually over many years. This sort of lactose intolerance does not occur before weaning age, which is considered to be between 2 and 4 years.Allergy and food intoleranceIf you have ruled out most of the obvious causes and your baby is still colicky, unhappy or experiencing dry and itchy skin, you may start to wonder whether your breastfed baby could be reacting to something in his diet or environment or, if he is exclusively breastfed, something in your diet.Starting solids and adding nutritional supplements, fruit juice or other baby drinks to your baby’s diet may trigger allergy symptoms. Once you start offering solids keep an eye out for any food he might be reacting to and avoid it for a while. Sometimes, a baby will react to a food his mother eats or a supplement she takes. Cow’s milk protein is one of the most common allergens.SeeAllergies and Food Intolerancesfor more information.Congenital disordersIn extremely rare cases, a baby is born with a congenital metabolic disorder such as ‘galactosaemia’ which affects the ability to digest and use lactose.Symptoms in a baby are obvious in the first few days as lactose in the mother’s milk increases. These may include dehydration, severe jaundice, illness, persistent vomiting and very poor weight gain. Medical tests may be needed to identify the cause of the problem so appropriate treatment can be given.Seek supportWhen you find yourself coping with a baby who is unhappy, your localLa Leche League groupcan be a great place to get practical and moral support. You may well find others there who have had similar experiences. An LLL Leader will be able to access more detailed information on specific conditions, if needed.Written by Sue Cardus and mothers of LLLGB.

Sleepy Baby – Why And What To Do,https://laleche.org.uk/sleepy-baby-why-and-what-to-do/,"Nobody likes to disturb a sleeping baby, but sometimes a baby can be too sleepy for their own good. At times like this they may need you to take action.Your newborn baby needs to nurse actively for one or both breast at each feed. Offer the second breast after they seem to have finished at the first, although they may not want both sides at every feed.What makes a baby sleepy?Recovering from birth:In the first few days, some babies are sleepy or uninterested in feeding. It’s especially true for small babies, after a difficult labour or birth, or if you received drugs for pain relief during labour.Jaundiceor an infection may make a baby sleepy. Newborn jaundice is normal but frequent breastfeeding helps prevent it becoming a problem.Not enough milk: Your baby may sleep to conserve energy if they are not getting enough food. They may also sleep longer that is good for them if they are apart from you.Is my baby too sleepy?To gain weight and stimulate your milk production, expect your newborn to:Breastfeed effectively at least 8–12 times in 24 hoursFeed actively from one or both breasts at each feed, swallowing regularly.Nurse at least every 2–3 hours from the start of one feed to the next, with one longer sleep of 4–5 hours.Have periods where they breastfeed on and off for several hours, usually in the evening.Gain weight from day 4 and regain birth weight by about two weeks.Look at our pageBeginning Breastfeedingfor more information. If your baby is too sleepy to do all these things they may need your active help to ensure they are nursing effectively and getting enough milk.Is my baby getting enough milk?A baby may lose up to 7% of their birth weight during the first few days. From around day 3-4, expect them to start gaining, and to regain their birth weight by 10-14 days. Many breastfed babies gain around 200-235g (7-8oz) as week for the first 2-3 months. If you baby consistently gains less, or they haven’t regained their birthweight by 14 days, seek skilled help to assess whether they are getting enough milk. What comes out is a sign of what has gone in, so counting dirty nappies can be a useful guide between weighing sessions. For more information to help you know if your baby is getting enough milk in the first few days, you could read our article here aboutsigns of effective feeding in the early days.And then after the first few days, this article will help you decideif your baby is getting enough milk.AgeDirty nappies per 24 hours1-2 Day1 or 2 greenish-black tarry meconium poos3-5 daysAt least 3 green transitional poos5+ daysAt least 3-5 yellow, loose unformed poos the size of a 2p coin or largerRemind your baby to nurseIf your baby is too sleepy or groggy to rouse themselves every few hours, you will need to wake them to feed to ensure they get enough milk.This will be easier if your baby is in a light sleep cycle: watch for rapid eye movements under their closed eyelids, arm and leg movements, sucking activity and changes in their facial expression.Aim for your baby to feed at least 10 times in 24 hours, including at least once at nightEncourage active nursing on the first breast, watching and listening for signs of swallowing.Use breast compression (see below) to keep your baby nursing actively.Offer the other side in the same way. You can switch back and forth several times if it helps your baby stay awake and feed.Encourage cluster nursing whenever your baby is more alert.Give expressed milk if they aren’t feeding well.Keep them close by—day and night—so they don’t sleep too long and you don’t miss their feeding cues.Also tryDimming the lights and keeping your surroundings quiet and peaceful.Keeping the room temperature at around 18°C or undressing your baby a little if the room is warm. Being too hot can make a baby sleepy.Unwrapping any blankets.Newborn feeding cuesSigns of interest in feeding include:Mouth movements; smacking or licking his lipsSucking on lips, tongue, hands, fingers, toes, toys or clothingRooting, head bobbing or nuzzling against whoever is holding themFidgting and squirming a lotFussingCrying – a late sign of hunger.Do offer feed generously.  A newborn won’t find it easy to feed well, if they have to wait and reached late hunger signs.Helping your sleepy babyPositioning and attachmentGetting a deep, comfortable latch is crucial. If your baby is not latched on well at the breast, they will have to work harder to get your milk. They may tire easily and fall asleep. Sometimes just a small adjustment to the way your baby comes to the breast can make a huge difference. An LLL Leader can provide individual suggestions tailored to your circumstances. If your breasts are engorged, gently hand express a little milk and/or ease swelling back with your fingertips to make it easier for your baby to latch on deeply and prevent you getting sore. See our longer article aboutPositioning and Attachmentfor more help on how to help your baby latch well, feed effectively and be comfortable for you.Copyright Suzanne TobinSeek skilled help early on if you are finding breastfeeding difficult or uncomfortable.Laid back breastfeedingTry letting your baby lie on your body with their chest and tummy against you as you recline at about 45 degrees. If they can snuggle up close to your chest for periods of time, even when sleepy or during light sleep, they will often instinctively seek the breast and attach deeply and comfotably even during light sleep. This can be done skin-to-skin or with you and your baby lightly clothed. Watch for signs your baby is stirring and gently encourage feeding. Spending time relaxing like this can make a real difference to how well your baby feeds and how much milk you make.  Our page onComfortable Breastfeedinghas more ideas.Breast compressionIf your baby starts to doze at the breast, this technique will help him breastfeed actively and take more milk.Cup your breast with your hand, near your chest wall, thumb opposite fingers in a C shape. Keep your hand well back from the nipple area.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, with their jaw moving all the way to his ear. When they stop swallowing, compress your breast firmly.  They probably start swallowing again. Hold it squeezed until they stop nursing actively, then release your hand.Rotate your hand around your breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast as needed. Go gently—this should not hurt.Switch nursingTry switching breasts at least two or three times during each feed—when your baby comes off the first breast on their own or when breast compression no longer keeps them breastfeeding actively.Express milk for your babyUntil your baby gets the hang of feeding you may need to do some work for your baby. If they aren’t latching at all, or is not feeding well and gaining weight, then expressing your milk will help establish milk production. The earlier you start, the sooner you’ll produce plenty of milk. Hand expression is often easiest at first but when your milk comes in combining hand expression with pumping can be most effective.Giving expressed milkFirst,encourage your baby to nurse at both breasts. Watch for swallowing and use breast compression an switch nursing until they stop drinking and start to doze.Next, give your baby expressed milk until they have had enough. (For more on how to give additional milk, our articlehere). Giving your  baby your expressed milk after breastfeeding can help them overcome sleepiness and feed more effectively next time.Then, once your baby has settled, express from both breasts switching back and forth and using compressions and hand expression to get the available milk. Store this milk in the fridge ready for the next feed.Aimto complete this process within about an hour.Avoid bottles and dummiesYou can give small amounts of expressed milk using a spoon, flexible feeding cup or syringe. If you decid to use bottles for larger amounts, you can give the bottle in a way that helps protect breastfeeding. For more information on ways to give your baby milk and bottles see our article onBottles and other tools. An alternative is to use a nursing supplement: this acts like a straw to deliver extra milk through a tube along your breast as your baby nurses, avoiding the need for bottles. Our articleNursing Supplementersexplains more.Don’t give up too soonIf your baby doesn’t respond quickly to your efforts to get him to breastfeed more often and more effectively, don’t give up. Keep your baby fed, Keep your supply protected and Keep your baby close. You may find our article onGetting breastfeeding back on trackafter a tricky start helpful.

Rhythms and Routines,https://laleche.org.uk/rhythms-and-routines/,"Mothering is about building relationships and nurturing the love and trust that enables babies and children to thrive. And mothering through breastfeeding is a normal, natural and effective way of doing this. Breastfeeding helps you nurture your relationship with your baby and meet their individual needs. It’s nature’s way of satisfying a baby’s need for food, love, comfort and connection.It can take time to learn what a baby needs. Some childcare experts promote strict routines for babies and young children. They claim that if a mother follows their rulebook, her baby will be perfectly content. But every baby is different. While we may feel reassured if our day follows a predictable pattern, strict routines for feeding and sleeping often fail to meet the needs of individual babies.Difficulties with routinesFull breasts slow down their rate of milk production, which may lead to:Problems caused by expressingBreastmilk: a balanced meal, a drink, a snackBreastfeeding: comfort and connection tooFrequent breastfeeds: day and nightOne breast or twoBreastfeeding patterns adjustFinding your own rhythms: a sense of freedomThink of breastfeeds as minor eventsExpect the unexpectedEstablishing helpful patternsBabies are little for such a short timeDifficulties with routinesSome babies will object strongly to an imposed routine that doesn’t meet their needs. Others are easy going, and give only subtle signals that a particular routine isn’t right for them. Early feeding cues include hand sucking, lip smacking, turning their head towards you, or fussing. Don’t wait until they are desperate—crying is a late sign of hunger. Trying to ‘stretch’ the gaps between feeds is hard work and stressful for you both and can reduce your baby’s overall intake of milk.A well-drained breast makes milk faster than a full one. Encourage your baby to nurse frequently enough to keep your breasts soft and comfortable.Full breasts slow down their rate of milk production, which may lead to:A baby gaining weight slowly or needing supplements to maintain adequate weight gain.A sleepy baby who needs to be roused and encouraged to breastfeed actively to get the food they need.Lengthy feeds.A fussy baby.Engorgement, blocked ducts or mastitis.Expressing milk (pumping) can cause problemsSome childcare experts advise pumping to keep milk supply one step ahead of a baby’s needs. However, expressing can interfere with the delicate balance that happens when your baby and body are in tune with each other. Making more milk than your baby needs increases your risk of mastitis. You may experience fast flow and/or oversupply causing your baby to gag, splutter or come on and off the breast. Your baby might also havecolicor be fussy.Breastmilk: a balanced meal, a drink, a snackJust like adults, babies feed irregularly—none of us eats the same amount at every meal, nor do we always follow a set timetable for eating and drinking. With easy access to the breast, babies will balance their intake of fluids, calories, proteins, fats and other nutrients so they receive exactly what they need. All that is usually needed is the confidence to let your baby take the lead.Breastfeeding: comfort and connection tooBreastfeeding isn’t just food and drink. It also helps you and your baby maintain that connection and closeness with each other. So when your baby is tired or unhappy or upset, theyinstinctively ask to nurse because it helps them regain a sense of rightness with the world. Many breastfeeding mothers say that the ability to calm and comfort a baby just by nursing is one of the main reasons for carrying on. It makes life easier and more peaceful for everyone.Frequent breastfeeds: day and nightYour baby needs to nurse frequently to establish and maintain your milk production, especially in the early weeks. While breastfeeds may be further apart in the morning, it’s very common for babies to nurse frequently (or ‘cluster feed’) in the evening.  Babies receive fattier milk when they nurse more often. Your baby is stocking up for the night and putting in their order for tomorrow! (See here for more on coping withFussy evenings with a newborn.)One breast or twoSometimes your baby will want one breast, at other times both. Your baby knows what they need—let them nurse actively from the first breast until they come off looking satisfied or sleepy. Then offer the second breast. After the first few months babies often become really efficient feeders—so don’t be surprised if they’ve finished in 10 minutes or so! Their nappy output and continuing weight gain will reassure you they are getting enough. (Is my baby getting enough milk?)Breastfeeding patterns adjustA baby’s growth rate and mother’s breast storage capacity will affect their nursing pattern. Even the weather can make a difference—a thirsty baby will probably nurse more in hot weather. When babies have growth spurts and seem extra hungry, most mothers find there’s no need to pump to keep up milk production—more frequent feeds will do the trick. Milk production quickly adapts to meet your baby’s needs and feeding patterns settle down within a few days.Finding your own rhythms: a sense of freedomCombining some predictability with flexibility can give you a sense of freedom and stop you feeling tied down. At first, life with a new baby can seem quite chaotic, but if you relax and observe your baby you will find gentle patterns emerging. You can build on these patterns, creating a daily rhythm to suit you both.Strict routines don’t necessarily make life easier for you.  Being tied to particular routines, nap-times and sleep places can  make getting out and about, visiting friends or taking holidays more complicated.Your needs and those of your baby will change with time and from day to day. Following your baby’s rhythms will help you meet their needs when they have has growth spurts or are ill. It will also give you confidence to adapt when necessary, for example for a doctor’s appointment or holiday travel arrangements. When your baby is attached toyou, rather than their routine, problems are less likely and you may feel more relaxed about managing the day.Think of breastfeeds as minor eventsJust as with your own tea-breaks, try thinking of feeds as minor and flexible events that fit in with everyday life rather than major events which have to be planned for.Expect the unexpectedWhatever your baby’s usual pattern is, there will always be times when they surprise you. They might sleep at a different time, sleep longer, or not at all. They might go longer between feeds, or suddenly want to feed more frequently. But there’s no need to panic—this is how babies are! We may never know the reason for such changes. Life will either settle back into the original pattern or a new one will establish itself. Your baby will continue to grow and surprise you over the coming years.Establishing helpful patternsMorning– Having a reasonably regular time and pattern for getting up and dressed can be a springboard for your day.Going out– Going out can help structure your day, entertain your baby and give you a sense of purpose. You can develop a routine for getting everyone fed, ready, and out of the house. Prepare what you’ll need the evening before if you need to get out early.Afternoon– Babies are often ready to have a sleep somewhere around the middle of the day. Babies are all different and patterns change as they grow and develop. Try to tune in to your own baby’s natural rhythms of feeding, alertness and sleep and adjust your activities to match them. A nap or a rest for yourself, too, can help boost your energy for the rest of the day.Night-time– A gentle evening routine, eg bath, rocking, singing and nursing can help a tired baby wind down to sleep. Watch for fussing, yawning and rubbing of eyes and start your wind down pattern promptly. Some babies are natural ‘night owls’, taking a late afternoon nap and being alert during the evening.Household tasks– Developing the ability to be ‘interruptible’ is a real help. Completing housework in small ‘bites’ while being prepared to pause and attend to children can be a successful way to meet everyone’s needs. Seeing the world through your baby’s eyes can help you slow down and enjoy the present rather than rushing to get things done. Mothering babies and young children is a full-time job—it’s ambitious to expect to be a cleaner, cook and gardener at the same time. Concentrate on essentials. Do those things you can do with a baby around and save really tricky jobs for times when you have help. It’s unlikely you’ll look back in years to come and wish you had done more housework!Babies are little for such a short timeYou can’t spoil a baby with love and attention. The easiest way to care for a baby is to accept and meet their need for closeness. Remember, you know your baby best; take the information, advice and the ideas that are helpful to you and ignore those suggestions that don’t feel right. You can develop rhythms and routines that are in tune with your needs, and those of your baby and family.For support in meeting your baby’s needs contact an LLL Leader by calling ourHelplineor visiting our website. It can be helpful to share experiences with others at yourlocal LLL groupwhere you can exchange practical tips.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of LLLGB.Pages you might also be interested in:Is My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Adjusting to MotherhoodBreastfeeding BasicsThe Unhappy BabySafe Sleep and the Breastfed BabyFussy evenings with a newbornFurther ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Nipple shields,https://laleche.org.uk/nipple-shields/,"A nipple shield is a thin, silicone teat that can be placed over a mother’s nipple and may help a baby who is having difficulty learning to breastfeed. Holes in the tip allow milk to flow into the baby’s mouth. A nipple shield can be used temporarily to help establish breastfeeding or in some cases to help ensure that breastfeeding continues. A shield provides a firm stimulus at the roof of a baby’s mouth where the soft and hard palate meet. This can help him suckle more effectively.If your baby is not nursing at all, or is nursing ineffectively despite improving attachment and  increasing milk flow, a nipple shield may help by providing a firmer stimulus in your baby’s mouth. A nipple shield may be a useful tool in some situations. When nothing else works, it can be a temporary way to establish and maintain breastfeeding.A nipple shield may be helpful ifYour baby is struggling to learn how to breastfeedYou have flat or inverted nipples, or very soft breasts as it can help maintain nipple shapeYour baby thrusts his tongue, has a retracted tongue or has neurological problemsYour baby was born prematurelyYour baby needs extra stimulus to prompt suckingIn these situations, a nipple shield canGive a baby the opportunity to learn to breastfeedAllow a baby who breastfeeds ineffectively to take more milk directly at the breast. This can be particularly helpful for premature babiesAvoid or reduce the need to express milk and use cups or bottlesHelp keep breastfeeding goingNot a magic solutionIt is very important to seek skilled help with positioning, attachment and any other problems if you are planning to use nipple shields or are already using them. Helping your baby get a deep latch at the breast is the key to effective and comfortable nursing with or without a nipple shield. A shield cannot correct underlying problems, especially those of sore and damaged nipples or low milk production. And if your baby is not attached well he may compress your nipple, causing damage and intense pain. When your baby latches on deeply at the breast he gets plenty of milk. Also, as you wean from the shield he will be able to adapt to breastfeeding effectively and comfortably without it.Source: United States Breastfeeding CommitteeEven with a nipple shield, your baby may still need help to learn to breastfeed well. Sometimes just a small adjustment to the way you hold your baby makes a big difference. You may find the suggestions and pictures inComfortable Breastfeedinghelpful. If you cannot get comfortable or breastfeeds are taking an hour or more,seek help from an LLL Leaderwho can give you personalised suggestions.Holding your baby in skin-to-skin contact can make a big difference too. With or without a shield, laid back or ‘natural’ breastfeeding positions (see above) can be a great help in encouraging your baby to latch on effectively, as well as being comfortable for you. You can either lie down or recline with your baby on top of you and with his whole front against you and his body completely supported by yours. Such positions also leave both your hands free to shape your breast and help him latch.If your baby won’t breastfeedDon’t panic! Some babies take time to learn. However, babies will often latch on and suckle spontaneously if they can snuggle up close to their mother’s bare chest for periods of time. Try letting your baby lie on your body as you recline so that both his chest and tummy are against you. This kind of contact, known asBiological Nurturing™, or laid back breastfeeding usually stimulates a baby’s instinct to attach and suckle well at the breast. In such positions, babies can also latch on when sleepy or even asleep. Watch for signs your baby is stirring and gently encourage feeding. If he is not breastfeeding  effectively or at all you will need to express your milk for him. This will help maintain your milk production while he learns to breastfeed. An LLL Leader can give you tips for effective milk expression.Is he getting enough milk?Offer frequent feeds and monitor wet and dirty nappies for evidence your baby is getting plenty of milk. His weight will need checking regularly—as often as every three days for premature babies. For more information seeIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Check your breastsAreas that aren’t being drained well may appear swollen, sore or red. Treat early signs of localised engorgement to avoid a blocked duct or mastitis.PracticalitiesType and fitModern nipple shields are made of clear ultra thin silicone. Different makes vary in flexibility. Some shields have a cut out section, but these may not stay in place as well as a full nipple shield. Full nipple shields do not bother babies or affect their breathing. Nipple shields come in different sizes but choice is limited. Both the width of the tip section and the shape of the flat part vary and you may need to experiment to find which size and shape you prefer. A comfortable fit is very important and some mothers need more than one size of nipple shield due to differences between their breasts.ApplyingStretching the shield onto the breast can help it stay in place. You can also moisten the shield’s edges or warm it with hot water to help prevent it moving. Turn the nipple shield almost inside out before applying it. Smooth it onto the breast, starting well away from the nipple in the area where your baby’s lower jaw will latch on. Stretch the shield over your breast, with the tip centred over your nipple. The nipple shield should be tight against your breast with your nipple extending into the tip. If necessary, you can express milk into the tip or drip expressed milk onto the outside to encourage your baby to latch on.Turning a nipple shield almost inside out before applying helps draw your nipple in. Put on your nipple and then smooth the edges onto your breast. (Photo J Fieth, LLLGB)CleaningIf you and/or your baby are in hospital, wash the nipple shield thoroughly in hot soapy water and sterilise it before each use. If you have a healthy, full-term baby and are at home, cleaning with hot soapy water or washing in a dishwasher on a hot cycle will be sufficient. Shields should be dried thoroughly before use and stored in a clean, sealed container or bag.A faster flowSwallowing encourages sucking, which will help keep milk flowing. A baby who has become used to a continuous fast flow from a bottle may need help to persist with breastfeeding. Hand expressing for a few minutes can encourage a good flow of milk before your baby latches on. You can even hand express milk into your baby’s mouth to encourage him to latch on or keep him nursing when your milk flows more slowly.Try breast compressionSupport your breast with one hand—thumb on one side, fingers on the other.Wait while your baby breastfeeds actively, his jaw moving all the way to his ear. When he stops swallowing, compress your breast firmly. Hold it squeezed until he stops nursing actively and then release your hand.Rotate your hand around your breast and repeat step 2 on different areas of the breast as needed. Go gently—this should not hurt.Use a shield with a nursing supplementerIf your baby needs extra milk, a nursing supplementer can be used to deliver this through a tube as  your baby breastfeeds. This avoids the need to bottle feed. The end of the supplementer tube can be placed either inside or outside the shield. Consult an LLL Leader if you think a nursing supplementer may be helpful.Giving up the shieldsNipple shields are intended to be a temporary solution until your baby learns to breastfeed without them. When using a shield, help your baby to latch on by himself with a wide open mouth. This will help him to learn to breastfeed without a shield. Offer your baby some time in skin-to-skin contact every day without a nipple shield so he has the opportunity to latch on if he is able. It can take time to wean from shields but do keep gently trying. Try at times when you and your baby are most comfortable and relaxed and there are fewest distractions. You can try different methods to see what suits your baby.Start with skin-to-skin next to breast without the nipple shield before nursing with the shield.Start a feed with a shield, removing it part way through nursing from one breast or when switching breasts.Gradually offer the breast without the shield.DO NOT CUT a silicone shield as this could leave sharp edges that would hurt you and your baby.Source: United States Breastfeeding CommitteeSeek supportWhilst you may be relieved that a nipple shield is enabling your baby to breastfeed, it can be frustrating if he will not feed without it. However, given time and patience, it is usually possible for a baby to learn to breastfeed without the shield. An LLL Leader can be a useful source of support if you need to choose, use and wean from nipple shields.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of La Leche League GB.Further ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.
