An autistic person may be described as neurodivergent.Autism presents differently across the spectrum and many autistic people’s abilities and challenges will change depending on the situation they are in. Many autistic women will choose to have children and breastfeed, and some breastfed children are autistic.Many autistic women and parents will choose to breastfeed. There may be additional challenges and strengths for both the autistic parent, and for the parent breastfeeding an autistic child.Breastfeeding for autistic women & parentsAn estimated 0.82% of the population of England are diagnosed autistic, but up to 72% of the autistic population of England are estimated to be undiagnosed[1], and this is something to consider when supporting parents. Autistic women and people may have different needs when accessing maternity care and breastfeeding support, and these needs may be different for each autistic person[2].Autistic women may all present differently, with a wide range of different experiences across the spectrum. Individualised support can be very helpful for autistic people, and some autistic people may struggle to access support in standard ways[3]. Autistic women may mask, which means they may suppress their behaviors in lots of situations, even when they need support.The PositivesMany autistic women say they find the act of breastfeeding provides calm, quiet time that they enjoy. Breastfeeding offers protected time to sit and rest, and many find breastfeeding empowering.Autistic women often excel at researching and finding out information independently. This means those who plan to breastfeed may already know a lot about breastfeeding and, if they decide to breastfeed, are likely to be very determined[4].Communication differencesSome autistic people have communication differences. This may be situational, for example, an autistic person may be unable to verbally communicate in certain situations, but able to speak the rest of the time. It can be useful to have a range of communication methods, including the option to write or type on a phone, use picture cards or sign language.Support for breastfeeding women & parentsSome people feel more comfortable attending local breastfeeding groups where there are pictures available to show exactly where to go and what happens at the groups, or when they can attend the group with a support person. Many autistic women find it difficult – or do not feel comfortable – asking for additional support.Some autistic women already feel that they haven’t had control over their own bodies and experiences after giving birth. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rates are higher in the autistic community compared with neurotypical people[5].Many autistic mothers experience a lack of social support and may find it challenging to seek support from maternity services[6]. This can be due to anxiety about attending groups or differences in communication. This may include struggling with phone calls, which prevents access to national helplines or reaching out to local breastfeeding support.LLLGB offers the option to seek breastfeeding support via a writtenHelp Form.Sensory differencesMany autistic people experience senses differently. Sensory differences can cause a heightened or reduced experience of smell, taste, touch, sight and sound. This may affect breastfeeding in a number of ways:The milk ejection reflex (MER), commonly called the ‘let down’, is a neurohormonal reflex that releases milk from the breast. This can be experienced as a tingly feeling, or in someone with sensory differences it may feel uncomfortable, or even be experienced as pain. Some do not feel the let down at all. Very rarely, some people experienceDysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-MER).Some people experience an aversion to nursing. This is often temporary and dependent on the situation. Some people with sensory differences may have an aversion to feeding in a noisy area, or a very bright or busy area. Some people experience this more strongly when dehydrated, very tired or having their period.Noise can be particularly difficult for some autistic people. Increased noise can cause so much sensory input that other input – such as touch or experiencing a let down – cannot be tolerated. Many mothers find that it can be helpful to use ear plugs or avoid loud areas. Often, this doesn’t apply to noise created by the person themselves, or their baby. Maternity care providers should be reminded of this when on postnatal wards.Key things to be mindful of when supporting an autistic person to breastfeed:Many autistic people prefer information that is “straight to the point”.Autistic women often want to be given all options to make an informed decision and have a practical plan going forward.Many expressed a dislike for support that involved physical touch.Breastfeeding an autistic childWhile adults can often go undiagnosed, autism diagnosis rates in children are increasing[7].The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding for two years and beyond, and the natural age of weaning is estimated at 2.5–7 years[8]. Breastfeeding may be very important to a child who is autistic, or suspected to be neurodivergent. There may also be additional support needs and considerations.Sensory differences in childrenAutistic or neurodivergent children may process things or experience sensory input differently. Some autistic children may be more sensitive to certain sensory experiences, and this may include avoiding or seeking sensory experiences.Sometimes, a child with sensory differences may want to breastfeed very frequently in order to regulate themselves. Sometimes sensory differences may mean a child wants to breastfeed less often.They may want to feed and be close to their mother or parent when feeling overwhelmed, for example when in a busy, loud, or unfamiliar place. Or they may find it difficult to feed when struggling with sensory input– this can be anything from the temperature of the room to their socks! If this happens, it can be helpful to change the situation in order to reduce or avoid the sensory input they are struggling with.High needs baby & feeding patternsMany babies and children may be described as being ‘high needs’. This typically refers to babies and young children who have an intense need to be close to their mother or primary caregiver which is normal and expected, but this can be particularly intense with neurodivergent children.Parents should be mindful of self-care.Support from family and friends, and finding like-minded communities is essential, particularly during the intense early years.Feeding patterns, boundaries and weaningMany breastfeeding parents of autistic children find frequent feeding in toddlerhood difficult, and have highlighted the need for increased information about weaning.Weaning can be more challenging with autistic children because of sensory and communication issues, or because breastfeeding is an important way for the child to co-regulate.An LLL Leader can offer support and information about boundaries andweaning from the breastat different ages and stages.If a child is experiencing sensory differences, they may struggle to eat solid foods and want to breastfeed frequently rather than eat. Sometimes, a child may only start rejecting certain foods due to texture, taste, smell or sight as they get older, and this may result in an increase in breastfeeding.Some autistic people have interoception difficulties. This means they may struggle to feel when they are hungry, thirsty or full.Many motherscontinue to breastfeeduntil their child outgrows the need (‘self-weaning’), and some will continue to breastfeed older children responsively (‘on demand’). Others may choose to set gentle boundaries, and limit the number or length of feeds, or when and where breastfeeding takes place. Some parents may choose to stop breastfeeding altogether.Continuing to breastfeed into toddlerhood and beyond provides a range of benefits for both the child and mother, and provides nutrients that a child may be missing from their diet if it is limited.A mother who is breastfeeding an autistic toddler or child may request support to place boundaries or limit breastfeeding, if they choose to. This can be challenging when communication issues are involved, but options are:Distraction from breastfeedingDelaying feedsLimiting feeds to a certain time of day, or limiting the length of feedsOffering food or drink instead of breastfeedingFinding another activity which helps with sensory regulationWritten by Emily Lunny, November 2023.

Weaning from Supplements,https://laleche.org.uk/weaning-from-supplements/,"Making the transition from using bottles, cups etc., to feeding at the breastThere are lots of reasons babies might need more milk than they can get directly at the breast:They don’t have enough energy to do all the work of feeding.They may have been born early or small-for-dates, or are unwell, orjaundiced, or have lost a lot of weight. They may be keen to feed, and have good feeding skills, but theyfall asleepbefore they’ve taken as much milk as they need. They need time, patience, and plenty of milk, before they can do all the work of feeding for themselves.and/orThere isn’t enough milk available at the breast to meet all their needs.This might happen if:Milk is slow to increasein the early days after birth, for example because the birth was very difficult, or if you have diabetes.Not enough milk is removed from the breastsin the early days after birth. This can happen because the baby wasn’t breastfeeding often enough (perhaps because they were very sleepy, or formula was being given instead of breastfeeding), or feeding was inefficient (perhaps they weren’t deeply attached at the breast, or had atongue tie). Most of us need to remove milk from our breasts at least 8 – 12 times in 24 hours, in the early weeks, to bring in a full milk supply.You have a limitation on how much milk you can make. This could be because of previous breast surgery, hormonal issues, or other factors related to your breasts or your health.Here is more information onhow milk production works.Babies need enough milk to grow well, and to give them enough energy to feed.Some babies need extra milk – known as “supplements” or “top ups”, as well as, or instead of, direct breastfeeding. Here is more information aboutincreasing your milk production, andhow to give supplements.Many babies who have needed supplements can go on to breastfeed exclusively(get all the milk they need, directly at the breast).1,2But not all can. For many reasons, we are seeing more families with complications that make exclusive breastfeeding out of reach. No one can guarantee, right now, how this is going to turn out for you. But whether or not you need to keep using supplements, we can help you find a way of feeding that works for you and your baby.Laying the foundations – Helping your baby to grow wellYour baby needs to be growing well, before you start reducing supplements. Babies who are well fed, feed better. The bigger and stronger they get, the more they can “grow into” breastfeeding. Work closely with your healthcare providers and a breastfeeding supporter (for exampleLLL Leader), to figure out the amount of supplement your baby needs.It might be suggested that you feed your baby a certain volume of supplement each feed or each day, perhaps based on their weight. A simpler approach, if you’re not sure what to do, is tolet your baby show you the amount they need. Offer more, if they seem to want it. They might take very different amounts at different feeds.It’s important touse feeding tools carefully, to avoid over-feeding. Just because a baby drinks milk from a bottle doesn’t necessarily mean they needed it – babies will suck on anything you put in their mouth. “Paced feeding” enables your baby to take breaks, and stop when they’ve had enough. Here is more information onhow to use bottles and other feeding tools.If your baby is very sleepy, or premature, their appetite might not be working well yet, and they may need active encouragement to take as much as they need.Your baby’s growth is the most reliable guide to whether they’re getting enough milk. This article has information onhow to work out if your baby is getting enough milk.Define your feeding goalIf your baby needs supplements at the moment, what you do next depends on what your feeding goal is.You might already be happy with the mix of feeding you’ve got. Expressed milk and/or formula can be used alongside, or instead, of direct breastfeeding, for as long as you want. You can read more inUsing Donor Milk and Formula to Support Breastfeeding.Some parents feed their babies entirely on expressed milk– a huge labour of love. You can find out more inExclusively Expressing Breastmilk For Your Baby.If you would prefer to be doing more breastfeeding, and less (or no) supplementing, read on…You also need support from a breastfeeding helper, and your midwifery or health visiting team.You need a plan that is safe for your baby, and tailored to your individual situation.It is really important to keep a close eye on your baby’s growth while you are working on reducing supplements. Babies are routinely weighed at certain times: around five days, ten days, six to eight weeks, and then once a month, if you want to. This is fine when feeding is going smoothly, and babies are thriving.This is not often enough while you’re working on transitioning from supplements to direct breastfeeding. Weekly weighing is more appropriate, gradually moving to fortnightly and then monthly, when it’s going well.Gradual weaning is safest – both from the supplements and the scales!You can find more information below on signs that your baby is ready to manage with less supplement.But your baby’s growth is the most reliable indicator of how things are going. You might find it useful to share this article with your healthcare team.Plan to reduce supplementsStep One: Maximise Your Milk Production[If your baby is already fed only on your milk, you can skip this step].If your baby needs donor milk or formula at the moment, and your goal is to feed them more of your own milk, then the most urgent task is to work on your milk production. This is much more time-critical than your baby learning to breastfeed, or to breastfeed better.Babies come hardwired to breastfeed, and can learn for many weeks(at least 2-3 months, maybe longer) after term birth. There are even case reports of adopted children aged over a year starting to breastfeed!3You can read about what’s most urgent, and what can wait, inGetting Breastfeeding On Track After a Difficult Start (the “Three Keeps”).The time-window for increasing milk production is shorter.Milk production normally reaches its peak by a month after birth, with most of the increase happening in the first two weeks. From 1-6 months, it stays about the same.4After the first month, your body is not expecting to increase the amount of milk you’re making, so it tends to get harder to increase it. Though you never know what you can do until you try, after the early weeks there are no guarantees of being able to get a lot more milk.If you want to make more milk, the earlier you act, the better your chances. To find out how, seeHow to Increase Your Milk Supply. Frequent, effective milk removal is key. If you want your breasts to make more milk, you need to keep reminding them that you need more (it’s a bit like nagging!).“Just breastfeed more often”?You might assume – or even be advised – that all you need to do to make more milk is to breastfeed your baby more often. This may be true,when a baby is good at breastfeeding, and breastfeeding is going smoothly.But it’s not true, and might be really unsafe, if breastfeeding is difficult for your baby, and it’s not yet going well.It’s a bit like asking your baby to do two jobs: feed themselfanddo the work of increasing your milk production – even though they don’t yet have a track record of doing even one of these jobs successfully! For now, you will need to do some (or even all) of the work for them.First Things FirstIt makes sense toconcentrate on your milk production first – before reducing supplements. It can feel overwhelming to try and do everything at once – prioritise what is most urgent. When you have more milk:Your baby won’t have to work so hard to remove milk from the breast.Breastfeeding will be more rewarding – so it will be easier to transition your baby to doing more breastfeeding.Signs that your milk production is increasingIf you’re expressing your milk, the amount you’re able to express each day will have increased. (It’s normal to have times when you can express more, or less – the daily total is what counts).You might notice that your breasts start to feel fuller more quickly between feeds or expressing sessions (although this is not always the case).If your baby is doing some direct breastfeeding, they might swallow more often, feed for longer and seem more satisfied after feeds.If your baby is doing quite a bit of breastfeeding, they might grow faster.How much milk do you need?It might be useful to know that between about one and six months, an average baby takes about 800ml in 24 hours. But some babies thrive on as little as 600ml, while some take as much as 1300ml.5The practical answer is:Enough to satisfy your baby andEnough for your baby to grow well.The first step is to replace some or all of the donor milk or formula supplements with supplements of your own milk.If your baby is premature or unwell,they might only be taking small amounts of milk at the moment. If your goal is to feed them only on your milk as they grow, you will need to aim to get the kind of amounts they’ll need later, not just the amounts they need now. The figures above can be a guide.The earlier you start expressing, and the more often you express, the more milk you’re likely to make. If you end up making more than your baby needs at the moment, you could freeze it for later use, or donate it to a Milk Bank, to benefit other premature babies.When you’re not able to produce all the milk your baby needs, it can feel really disappointing to realise that they will keep needing donor milk or formula as well.If, despite your best efforts, the amount of milk you’re making has stopped increasing, or hasn’t increased at all, you have probably reached the limit of the amount you can make. A breastfeeding supporter can help you work out if you’ve reached this point.Some of us wonder whether, if we can’t make all the milk our baby needs, there is any point in carrying on at all. While only you can make the calculation about whether the effort you’re putting in is worth it, any amount of human milk protects babies in ways no other milk can.6,7You can find more information about thepower of your own milk(however much you’ve got!), andusing other milk to support your baby’s growth.Now you are in a new phase: maintaining the amount of milk you’ve got. You can experiment to see how many times you still need to feed or express, to keep up this amount. (This piece explains how to do it:The ‘Magic Number’ and Long-Term Milk Production). As long as you keep removing this amount, you will keep making this amount.It’s a long game.After babies start eating family foods, around six months, their need for milk gradually reduces. It’s often possible to reduce, and maybe stop using, supplements of donor or formula milk, while keeping on breastfeeding or expressing for as long as you want. Many of us who’ve had to deal with low milk production in the early months find that we can really relax and enjoy breastfeeding at this stage.Step Two – Transitioning to the BreastWhen you’ve got as much milk as you need, or can get, you’re ready to think about reducing supplements.Work with a breastfeeding helper to make a tailored plan for you and your baby.Yourlocal La Leche League Leaders(breastfeeding counsellors) may be able to support you themselves, or help you find someone else who can. Many areas have an NHS Infant Feeding Team to help families with complex feeding issues – ask your midwife or health visitor where you can get specialist help.If your baby isn’t breastfeeding yet, seeMy Baby Won’t Breastfeedfor lots of tips on how to help your baby make a positive relationship with the breast.Celebrate the baby steps: drinking from a cup or bottle while in skin-to-skin contact; falling asleep afterwards with cheek pillowed on breast; having a short try at the breast after taking some supplement. If your baby is able to stay at the breast for even a short time, it’s valuable practice. Learning to breastfeed, when something is making it difficult, is like exercising: you wouldn’t expect to run a marathon without doing lots of much shorter training runs first. Your baby gets much more from breastfeeding than just milk – don’t forget to savour the other stuff!Make sure you’re using your feeding tools well.They’re there to support breastfeeding, not compete with it. Babies are very smart – if breastfeeding is difficult for them, and another method is much easier, they might prefer to stick with the other method. SeeBottles and Other Toolsfor how to use bottles well, and lots of alternatives if you prefer not to use them.Consider some extra (or different) feeding tools.It might be as simple asreplacing some or all bottle-feeds with a cup or supplementer(see below). Limiting or reducing use of artificial teats (includingdummies) can encourage reluctant babies to spend more time at the breast.A“nursing supplementer”(sometimes also called a lactation aid) enables you to feed your baby expressed milk or formula at the breast while they breastfeed, via a thin tube placed by your nipple. This can be a great tool to help transition a reluctant baby to the breast, or for longer-term use if milk supply is low. Find out more:Nursing Supplementers. (Read two mother’s stories, here:Breastfeeding With a Nursing Supplementerand here:In Praise of At-Breast Supplementers.)Another tool is anipple shield– a thin layer of silicone, placed over your own nipple. Fitted and applied well, they can help a bottle-feeding baby transition to the breast, or a baby with a weak suck (for example because they’re premature) take more milk.8If you’re interested in trying these tools, it’s helpful to work with a breastfeeding supporter who knows how to use them.When you’ve got all the pieces in place…Your milk supply is as high as you need, or can getYour baby is growing wellYou’ve chosen feeding tools carefully, and are using them wellYour baby is willing to feed at the breast, at least sometimes…What next?While the process will look different for every baby, these principles can help you and your breastfeeding supporters along the way.Never go “cold turkey”!Sometimes, parents are advised to stop using supplements suddenly, to “force” their baby to breastfeed. Unless your baby is almost exclusively breastfeeding already, and growing well, this is extremely unsafe.Babies never choose not to breastfeed well – if they don’t, it’s because they can’t, not because they won’t!Your baby needs their usual amount of milk throughout this process.Watch your baby for signs of readiness.Babies who lacked energy to feed show us when they are ready to take on more work. If your baby was premature and sleepy, or has had a tongue tie division, for example, there will come a time when you start to notice that their feeding is changing. It feels like they’re sucking more strongly, and maybe keeping it up for a bit longer. They might start wanting less supplement.Nowthey’re ready tobegindoing more of the work of feeding.Take it steady. We know it’s really tempting to rush this – you want to breastfeed! – but it pays to make the transition carefully. Your baby doesn’t have a track record of breastfeeding yet, and it might take a while before they’re good at it. If they’re small, low in energy or unwell, they’re unlikely to be able to do all the work of feeding today, when yesterday they were doing little or none.If your baby was born prematurely, expect it to take at least until their original due date, plus a bit longer, before they’re able to do all the work. They’ve had more to cope with out here in the world, than if they’d been born later. The more health complications they’ve had, the more time they’re likely to need. We know it’s really frustrating not to know exactly how long this will take. Connecting with other families who have already made this transition may be the most helpful thing you can do at this stage. Yourlocal LLL groupwould love to support you.Do a small trial, keeping a close eye on your baby’s nappies, and weight. If you feel your baby might be ready for a step forward – try it! Breastfeed a bit more, and offer alittleless supplement. If you’ve been giving, say, 300ml per day, see what happens if you reduce it to 270ml. You could spread this reduction out over more than one feed. If your baby is able to take more milk from the breast, they’ll continue to produce wet and dirty nappies as normal, and to grow well. If their nappy output reduces, or their weight gain slows, you will need to go back a step, and try again later.It’s really important to weigh your baby regularly during this stage.Two weeks, or a month, is a really long time for a baby – and for your milk supply – if things turn out not to be going well.In between weight checks, notice how your baby is responding to any reduction in supplement.If your baby seems unsatisfied after the reduced supplement, this may be a sign that it’s been reduced by too much, too fast. You could try offering the breast after a supplement, and see how they respond. They might be satisfied with the comfort that being at the breast provides, rather than more milk – or they might need more supplement.If you’re expressing, cut back gradually.If you’ve already been working hard to build your milk supply by expressing, you know exactly how precious it is! Reduce the number of times you express one at a time. Only take the next step if your baby continues to grow well. For example: if you’ve been expressing six times in 24 hours, start by reducing to five, spending more time breastfeeding.After a few days (ideally no more than a week), weigh your baby again. If your baby has grown well that week, reduce your pumping sessions to four, and repeat. It might feel frustratingly slow, but you don’t want to risk damaging the milk supply you’ve worked so hard for. If you notice your breasts becoming uncomfortably full, it may be a sign that your baby is not yet as efficient at the breast as you hoped. Over-full breasts reduce milk production. Keep your breasts comfortable by expressing a little more, until you’re ready to experiment with reducing expressing again.Expect some steps backwards, as well as forward.Babies who are finding breastfeeding hard work will do their best job when they’re in their best state: healthy, well-rested and calm. Expect better feeding early in the day, and for things to feel like they’re falling apart when they’re tired, frustrated, or in a bad mood. Anyone can have a bad day, including babies!If a breastfeeding session isn’t going well, you can always hit “pause”, and offer a supplement instead. There’s no point forcing it, if both of you are upset. The next feed, or the next day, might go better. If it doesn’t, take a break, and talk to your breastfeeding helper about what to do next.Track changes. It’s helpful to collect some ‘data’ as you go along. This helps you, and your breastfeeding supporter, see how things are changing over time. You don’t need to go into huge detail – daily totals are fine. You could use an app, a spreadsheet or just a piece of paper, to record:How much expressed milk, donor milk or formula you used each dayHow many times your baby breastfedYour baby’s wet and dirty nappiesThis, along with your baby’s weights recorded in their red book, will give you enough information to tell how your plan is working.Reducing supplements is like crossing over a bridge which looks a bit rickety.You’re not quite sure if it will hold you up. You don’t jump straight into the middle – you take one step at a time, checking it’s holding your weight, before you take the next one. If it starts to give way – you jump backwards!Just like breastfeeding, reducing supplements is an art. You need plenty of patience, and good support. Many mothers in our groups have been through this process, and would love to encourage you. Maybe you will get all the way to your goal – such as exclusively breastfeeding your baby, or feeding them only on your milk – or maybe you won’t. However it turns out, you can find a way of feeding that works for you and your baby, and which you can both enjoy. Whatever feeding looks like for you, we’re here to help.Written by Jayne Joyce, March 2023.

Parenting when your partner breastfeeds,https://laleche.org.uk/parenting-when-your-partner-breastfeeds/,"All parents have a unique relationship with their baby, which grows and develops as their baby does. A  breastfeeding mother builds a special relationship  with her baby through the act of breastfeeding. But  children build important relationships with other adults  in their lives, beginning with those they see most often.This may be the baby’s biological father, but it can be anyone  else who lives with mother and baby and who is a constant  presence in their lives. LLL recognises that families come in many  different shapes and sizes. In most relationships there will be a  non-breastfeeding partner although sometimes both partners  may breastfeed. An LLL Leader can give you more information  about this option.A different personYou are different from your breastfeeding partner, with a different  feel, a different sound and a different smell. At the end of a long  day a new and different person with a fresh pair of arms may be  just what is needed to settle your tired and fractious baby.Carrying and comfortingThe love hormone oxytocin, released when a mother breastfeeds,  promotes a feeling of closeness and connection with her baby.  But oxytocin isn’t limited to just nursing mothers. It works in a similar  way when you hold, cuddle and care for your baby. A great way to experience continuous close contact with your baby is to use a carrier  or sling. Babies usually love them and it’s a handy way to settle a baby.  At times when your baby is fussy or uncomfortable and nothing else  works, you might also try the colic hold.Breastfeeding—the obvious choiceBreastfeeding is the normal way to feed and comfort a baby.  It is protective against asthma, coeliac disease, cot death,  diabetes, diarrhoea and tummy upsets, ear infections and  heart disease, to name but a few. What is more, the practical  everyday benefits include:No getting up to prepare bottles during the night.Sweet smelling nappies.No feeding equipment and expensive formula to buy for your baby.Less to take with you when you go out as a family.Early DaysIn the early days, your baby will probably want to breastfeed a lot of the time he’s awake. At this stage, your partner may only be  managing to eat, sleep and nurse the baby. This is normal. At first  his mum and nursing will be the centre of your baby’s world. A  baby’s bond with his mother is the basis for all other relationships.  Encouraging that bond will strengthen his love for you later.As life settles downYou and your partner will probably both need time to adjust to  your new roles. Many couples say they didn’t feel prepared for  the emotional upheaval they experienced on becoming parents.  A breastfeeding mother usually feels an intense connection with  her baby, both emotionally and physically, due to breastfeeding  hormones and the practical need to stay close to feed the baby. It  can be easy to feel a bit left out of this. Getting involved in practical  ways such as nappy changes, baths, walks and playtimes will help  you bond with your baby. Caring for your baby teaches them that love comes from interacting with people as well as from food. Your  partner will love you for it and so will your baby.Maintaining your closeness as a coupleAlmost every sexual relationship changes with the birth of a baby.  Daily life can be exhausting and your partner may need time to  recover physically. Resuming your sex life together may take  time, but simple gestures like kissing, holding hands and sitting alongside her as she nurses your baby can keep you connected  and remind you of your love for one another.Support for youSometimes there is so much focus on the health and well-being of mum and baby that partners may be overlooked. Post-natal depression can affect either person in a couple, especially after a  difficult birth. Tell your partner and seek help from your GP if you are in this situationWhat partners can doYour partner needs practical help and emotional support while recovering from the birth.Mum and baby need to establish a strong bond, plentiful milk production and an enjoyable breastfeeding relationship. You  can help this happen with your attitude, actions and words:Support mother-baby bonding.The  most important thing you can do for your  baby’s future health and well-being is to  be a breastfeeding advocate.Make the most of your parental  leave.Take as long as you can manage.  Take it when the new mum and baby  would otherwise be at home alone.  Concentrate just on the needs of your  partner, baby and any other children. Let  everything else wait.Fix it so the household ‘ticks over’.Take  charge and welcome help from others.  You could also buy in help: a cleaner,  supermarket delivery, mother’s help.Guard against too many visitors.Let others know when your new little  family needs to be alone. Protect mum  and baby from over-enthusiastic visitors  and callers, and try to ensure you all  have some peaceful uninterrupted time  together. Turn off the phone and put a  ‘do not disturb’ sign on the front door.Look after your other children.Provide fun activities and opportunity  for exercise. Try to meet their needs for  attention, sleep and healthy food.Protect your partnerfrom well meaning  but unhelpful advice that undermines  breastfeeding—even if it comes from your own mum!Seek skilled helpif any breastfeeding  problems crop up. Problems are more  easily solved if you call for help straight  away. Problems with soreness or not  enough milk can usually be fixed easily if  you track down the right help early on. So  keep looking until you find that help. New  mums are often given a contact number  for a breastfeeding counsellor or peer  supporter. Encourage your partner to give  her a call.Respect your partner’s instincts.Nature isn’t daft and maternal instincts  have ensured the survival of our species  for millions of years. A new mum’s  hormones motivate her to mother her  baby through breastfeeding.Fight off any pressure to separate  mum and baby.Help mum and baby  spend lots of time snuggling together in  the hours and days after birth.Search for details of local mums’  breastfeeding groups.Encourage  your partner to attend before and after  birth so she gets this vital mother-to mother contact. She will get ongoing  support to carry on breastfeeding as  long as she and baby want. It can make  all the difference.Admire and praise your baby’s  mother.Your love and encouragement  will work wonders.Firmly resist pressuresto feed baby  anything other than mum’s own milk  before he is six months old. Your baby doesn’t need other foods until they can sit up and begin to feed themselves. Even then, breastmilk carries on being an important  food for older babies and toddlers.Meet your baby’s need for you.Spend time with your baby and enjoy  building your own unique relationship.Getting helpLLL Leaders are skilled at helping new  mothers.

How milk production works,https://laleche.org.uk/how-milk-production-works/,"Mothers have successfully fed their children for thousands of years of human history without understanding how it works. It’s a bit like driving a car – as long as it’s working well, you don’t need to know what is going on under the bonnet!If you are having breastfeeding problems, such aslow milk supplyortoo much milk, or are wondering why your baby’s feeding pattern is different from what you expected, it can help to understand more about the science of lactation (producing milk).Most of the research that has ever been done on breastfeeding and human milk has been done in the last few years. It is a very exciting time for lactation science. Lots of things that experienced mothers have always known turn out to have a clear basis in the anatomy of the breast and the science of milk production, for example:Each baby and mother pair is differentHealthy babies are the best judges of when and how to feedThe way to make more milk is to remove more milkGetting ready – the developing breastBreast development starts around the age of 10-12 years. From puberty, the breast grows a little with each menstrual cycle. Inside the breast, the branches and buds that will become milk ducts and alveoli (milk storage sacs) start to develop. Radiation or trauma to the chest at this stage can have an impact on later breast development.Lactation begins – pregnancyFor many women, tender breasts are an early sign of pregnancy. The breast completes its development during pregnancy, and milk production begins in the middle trimester. If a pregnancy ends after 15-16 weeks, colostrum (early milk) will be present. Some women choose toexpress colostrum in the last few weeks of pregnancy. This is recommended for women with diabetes, whose milk may be a bit slower to increase and whose babies may have low blood sugar after birth.1Colostrum expressed before birth can be stored, to be given to the baby if they need extra milk. Mothers with high-risk pregnancies, or who are concerned about having enough milk, may also choose to express colostrum in the last weeks of pregnancy. It is usually recommended not to start before 36 weeks, unless premature birth is imminent. The amount of colostrum you can express before birth does not predict your ability to make enough milk afterwards.After birth (day 1-3)– lactation takes off!During pregnancy, milk production is held in check by the hormone progesterone, produced by the placenta. Once the baby is born and the placenta is delivered, levels of progesterone drop rapidly; this, coupled with high levels of prolactin, allows lactation to begin fully.Retained placental fragments can reduce or even stop milk production. If you have unexplained low milk production and are still bleeding heavily or irregularly after you would expect to have stopped, check with your midwifery team or doctor. Removal of the last fragments of placenta will usually allow milk production to resume normally.Mothers typically start to notice the signs of “onset of copious milk production” (also known as milk “coming in”) two or three days after birth. For a day or two you might experience:Breast tendernessWarmthDiscomfortSwellingIncrease in breast sizeMild feverThe discomfort you feel is primarily due to tissue swelling, in response to the sudden increase in milk volumes. Don’t panic – your breasts won’t feel like this for long! As your breasts adjust to making the amount of milk your baby needs, the swelling will settle down. If feeding your baby or expressing milk doesn’t quickly help you feel more comfortable, there are other steps you can take todeal with engorgement.Onset of copious milk production can happen a bit more slowly:For first-time mothersAfter a more difficult birthYou may have read that being overweight or obese (having a higher BMI, especially over 30) can lead to breastfeeding problems. It is not clear whether having a higher BMI, by itself, is a problem for breastfeeding and many women with high BMI breastfeed easily. We do know that some conditions associated with higher BMI, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, may delay your milk “coming in” (increasing in volume) in the early days after birth. This can make breastfeeding more challenging.To make milk, remove milk (day 3-4 onwards)Until day 3-4, milk production is controlled entirely by hormones and will happen automatically, whether or not you go on to breastfeed. After day 3-4, another mechanism comes into play. Milk will only continue to be made if milk is removed from the breasts. The more milk that is removed, the more milk will be made. This enables your body to adapt to the number of babies you have. With enough milk removal, it is possible to exclusively breastfeed twins or triplets! If you do not breastfeed or express milk at all, your milk production will shut down within about two weeks after birth.Remove milk earlyThe amount of milk that is removed in the period immediately after birth is important for later milk production. Research on lactation after premature birth has shown that starting to express milk within an hour of birth, compared with starting at six hours, is associated with more milk six weeks later.2If your baby has any risk factors for not being able to feed effectively at first, such as being:PrematureSmall for gestational ageUnwellJaundicedSleepySeparated from youthen early, frequent milk expression will help to ensure plenty of milk to meet their needs, now and later. You can see a useful video about thishere:Parents who haverisk factors for low milk supplycan give their milk production the best possible start by removing milk early and frequently after birth.Risk factors include:Previous history of low milk productionPrevious breast radiation or surgeryPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)Thyroid problems (hypo- or hyper-)A history of infertility with hormonal causeUnevenly sized, widely spaced breasts, with little or no changes during or after pregnancyObesity (BMI over 30)People with these risk factors may be able to make a full or partial milk supply – you never know what you can do until you try! If you are not producing all the milk your baby needs, you can still enjoy a close, happy feeding relationship with your baby. You can read more about how to use donor breastmilk or formula milk to support breastfeedinghere.Some mothers who need to supplement their own supply with donor milk or formula milk in the early months are able to reduce or eliminate the supplementary milk after their baby starts complementary foods, at around six months, going on to happily breastfeed alongside solids.Remove milk oftenAfter their first feed and a few hours of sleep, full-term, healthy newborn babies feed frequently, around the clock. Most babies need to feed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours in the early weeks, suckling and swallowing actively at each feed, to get enough milk and stimulate their mother’s milk production. If your baby is not feeding as often or energetically as this yet, it is important toexpress your milk, if your goal is a full milk supply.As milk builds up in the breast, a protein in the milk, known as the “Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation” (FIL), begins to slow down milk production. Breasts that are full make milk slowly, and eventually not at all. Breasts that are well drained make milk quickly. This is why, if you are trying to maximise milk production, it is important not to wait until your breasts feel full before feeding or expressing. Over time, this will reduce milk production.Different breasts, different feeding patternsStorage capacityis quite a new concept in breastfeeding, and it explains a lot of things that mothers instinctively knew, but were not in the textbooks!3A mother’s storage capacity is the amount of milk that her breasts canholdbetween feeds. It isnotrelated to breast size and it isnotrelated to the total amount of milk that a mother can make each day.To understand storage capacity, let’s assume that:Alisha and Beth both have 3 month old babies and well established milk supplies.Alisha’s breasts can hold 75ml of milk and Beth’s breasts can hold 150ml of milk.Both their babies need about 750ml of milk per day (this is an average amount. Some babies might take as much as 1200ml per day).Alisha’s baby needs to feed at least 10 times in 24 hours to get this amount of milk, while Beth’s baby could get the same amount of milk in only five or six feeds. [Feeding this infrequently is not common – it is at one end of a wide spectrum of feeding patterns!]Both babies are getting as much milk as they need and growing well, but they have very different feeding patterns. What happens if Alisha and Beth are told that their babies “should” both be feeding eight times in 24 hours?Alisha’s baby is hungry and miserable. She is no longer getting enough milk and if this continues, Alisha’s milk production will slow down due to the action of FIL in the full breast. It might be hard to increase milk production again, after the early weeks, when milk supply settles at a stable level.Beth’s baby is irritable because his mother keeps trying to feed him again when he doesn’t want any more milk!Both Alisha and Beth can successfully breastfeed their babies as long as their feeding pattern works for their milk storage capacity.Beth, with her larger storage capacity, has more flexibility in her feeding patterns. Her baby is likely to have fewer feeds per day than Alisha’s, is more likely only to take one breast per feed and may start sleeping for longer stretches earlier. She could choose to feed more often, if her baby wanted to.Alisha has less flexibility in her feeding patterns because if she doesn’t feed often enough, her breasts fill up and she doesn’t have room to make more milk. Her baby is likely to feed frequently day and night during the exclusive breastfeeding period and may need to feed on both breasts at most feeds.Most babies need to feed at least 8-12 times in 24 hours and it is important to ensure frequent feeding during the early weeks, when milk production is becoming established. After the early weeks, most babies spend less total time feeding, as efficiency improves. Some babies will also significantly reduce the frequency of feeds.Most mothers never need to worry or even think about their breast storage capacity, because their babies are brilliant at working it out for them! Full-term, healthy, thriving babies are able to choose their own feeding pattern that works with their mother’s breasts and their own needs as they grow. . If your baby is growing well and seems contented, their feeding pattern is working well for them.Fat in milkThis is a topic that often worries parents, because of poorly understood information circulating among families about the differences between “foremilk” and “hindmilk”.We know from research that:The breast makes milk fat at a stable level. The types of fat in milk are somewhat related to the types of fat in the mother’s diet, but the amount of fat is not related to her diet.The milk available at the start of a feed (often referred to as foremilk) has a lower level of fat than the milk at the end of the feed (often referred to as hindmilk). As the breast is drained, fat levels in milk increase as more fat droplets are “squeezed” to the front of the breast and out through the nipple.The level of the fat at the start of one feed depends on how long it has been since the last feed. The longer the interval between feeds, the lower the level of fat at the start of the next feed.Parents often worry, or are told, that their baby might not get enough fat (this is often described as “getting too much foremilk”)Research shows that full-term, healthy, thriving babies are brilliant at balancing their own diets. They will stop feeding when they have had enough calories. When fat levels in milk are higher, they will take less milk. When fat levels are lower, they will take more. The varying amount of fat in milk is not a problem – all the milk is good! It enables babies to quench their thirst at the start of a feed and finish with a creamy “dessert”, if they want to.The balance of fat in milk can be a problem for a small number of babies, if:The baby is taken off the breast before they have had as much milk as they wanted; orThere is an overwhelming amount of milk. In this case, the baby may be growing very fast (their growth curve crosses centiles upwards on the growth chart) and may struggle with the speed of milk flow, coming off the breast gagging, spluttering and upset. You can find practical tips to help your baby manage fast milk flowhere.In either of these two situations, the baby may not get enough fat to slow down the transit of milk through their gut. Milk may rush through the gut faster than the baby can digest the milk sugar (lactose). The sugar ferments in the gut, producing green, frothy, explosive poo, flatulence (farting) and severe discomfort.A baby who does yellow poo and is comfortable does not have any problem with the balance of fat in their diet. A baby who is growing more slowly than expected needs more milk overall, not just more fat. These babies should be seen by a doctor to rule out an underlying health problem.You can read more about fat levels in milkhere.How much milk?In the first 24 hours after birth, volumes of colostrum are small, but enough for your baby. The average amount per feed is about 7ml (1 ½ teaspoons). This is because full-term babies are not hungry – they are born with food stores in their body. They don’t need fluid – they shed extra fluid in the first few days (this is why most babies lose a little weight). Colostrum is primarily immune protection, rather than food. It coats the inside of the baby’s gut to keep pathogens out, stimulates the baby’s immune system, and provides the baby with a powerful, tailor-made dose of growth factors, hormones, live immune cells and other components that no manufactured milk can begin to match.The small quantity and thick texture of colostrum give the baby a chance to practice feeding before they have to manage larger volumes. The amount of colostrum increases quickly, more or less doubling every day in the first few days. If you need to express on the first day after birth, you might use a syringe to catch drops. A syringe quickly becomes too small for the increasing volumes. By the 5thday after birth a baby might be taking 60ml (2oz) or more per feed.If you are expressing your milk, for example because your baby was born early, it can help to know how much to aim for:500ml in 24 hours by the end of the first week after birth750ml in 24 hours by the end of the second or third week after birthYour baby might not need this much milk yet, but aiming for a full supply now means you will have enough to satisfy them for the rest of their breastfeeding time.Milk production remains stable, within a range of about 600ml – 1200ml per 24 hours, from about one month after birth to six months. After the baby starts eating complementary foods, milk production starts to decrease, as milk is gradually replaced by other foods in the baby’s diet. If you are making as much milk as your baby needs at one month, you are likely to keep on doing so, as long as your baby keeps on removing enough milk and you don’t get pregnant or use one of a small number of medications that can affect milk production. Birth control methods that contain progesterone may reduce milk production in some women.4How milk changesIf you are expressing your milk, you will be able to see the change from sticky, transparent, yellow or orange colostrum to thinner, white or blue-ish “transitional milk” by about the fourth day after birth. The composition of your milk is changing to adapt to your baby’s need for more energy. Your milk changes from day to day for as long as you breastfeed or express, responding to your baby’s stage of development, any illnesses you or your baby are in contact with, and even the time of day or night it was made.5The milk of mothers who give birth prematurely is initially different from the milk of mothers who give birth at full term, to meet the extra needs of their babies.Getting back on track after a difficult startMilk production peaks by about a month after birth, with most of the increase happening in the first two weeks. Many mothers find it becomes more difficult – in some cases impossible – to increase the amount of milk they are making, after the early weeks. This is why it is important to get good feeding support early, if there are any signs that there might be a problem with your baby getting enough milk, for example, if your baby:Does not poo every day (in the first 4-6 weeks)Has pink crystals (urates) in their nappy after the third dayIs not doing yellow poo by the end of the fourth dayLoses more than 7% of their birth weight by the fifth dayLoses weight after the fifth dayDoes not regain their birth weight by 10-14 daysAn LLL Leader or infant feeding specialist can help you work out whether there is likely to be a problem with milk production or whether (more commonly)your baby is not yet feeding effectively. If not enough milk is being removed, the risk is that your milk production will not increase to the level your baby needs. Expressing your milk gives you time to work on any feeding issues.If the problem is with milk production, your breastfeeding supporter can help you make a plan to keep your baby safely fed while you work tomaximise your milk supply. You will need to work closely with your baby’s healthcare providers to monitor their growth and wellbeing.Lactation beyond the early monthsParents are sometimes told that their milk has no value to their baby after 6 months, or 12 months.This is not the case.Milk is the baby’s main source of protein and calories until about a year of age, and continues to contribute to the child’s health and nutrition through the second year and beyond.Your milk adapts to meet your baby’s needs as they grow. For example:From about six months, the digestive enzyme amylase starts to be present in milk, helping your baby digest starchy foods.From about six months, levels of the antibacterial enzyme lysozyme increase in milk, protecting your baby as they put foods and other objects in their mouth.As the total amount of milk begins to decrease gradually, from about six months, levels of key immune factors such as immunoglobulins increase, so that the child receives about the same amount per day, even though they take less milk.Levels of fat, protein and energy in milk are higher in the second year than in the first year of lactation.67Lactation ends – involutionMilk will continue to be made in the breast for as long as milk is removed from the breast. In the early days of lactation, milk supply is relatively fragile – the mother’s body quickly shuts down production if milk removal stops. In later lactation, milk production is much more robust. Mothers returning to work after six months, for example, can be confident that their milk supply will withstand variations in their schedule from day to day and week to week. In later lactation it is possible to breastfeed part-time, even if you work shifts or need to travel away overnight. Many breastfeeding toddlers and older children spend time away overnight with a non-resident parent, grandparents, etc. and continue breastfeeding when they are with their mother.It takes at least 40 days for the breast to reach complete “involution” (a non-lactating state) after the end of breastfeeding or milk expression. Some mothers find that they leak or can express drops of milk months or even years after their last feed. If the amount of milk is large, or you start making milk again after a gap even though you are not pregnant, check with your doctor. Spontaneous milk secretion (galactorrhoea) can be a side effect of some medications, or a sign of hormonal dysfunction.When children are able to wean from the breast at their own pace, weaning often takes place over a period of months and years. The most common time for children to choose to stop breastfeeding is between their second and third birthdays.8Milk production reduces gradually and, by the time the child has their final feed, may have dwindled to almost nothing. Some of the immune components of milk become more concentrated as milk volumes decrease, so the child continues to benefit to the last drop of breastmilk.Written by Jayne Joyce, LLL Oxfordshire and Karla Napier, LLL Edinburgh – February 2021Endnotes:1Forster, D.A. et al.

How to increase your milk supply,https://laleche.org.uk/how-to-increase-your-milk-supply/,"Is your milk supply really low?New mothers who are learning to breastfeed often worry that they might not be making enough milk for their baby. Their breasts might stop feeling full and their baby might sometimes be unsettled, or not want to be put down between feeds. There are many reasons for babies to be unsettled and breasts usually get softer after the first few weeks – these are not proof of low milk supply. If your baby is growing as expected (at least 20-30g a day, on average, during the first three months) just on your milk, then your milk supply is fine. If your baby does not grow well on your milk alone, then you may be making less milk than your baby needs.The most common reason for genuine low milk supply is a slow start with breastfeeding, when not enough milk was removed from your breasts in the early days after birth. It may be possible to turn this around, with prompt action. Some other causes of low milk supply, such as previous breast surgery and some hormonal conditions, may mean that there is a limit to how much milk you can produce.Many nursing parents can make more milk than they are making, and you never know what you can do until you try!Increasing low milk supply is hard work.It takes time, energy and commitment. It is important to be realistic from the start about your goal and how much time and energy you are able to invest. It works best when you have lots of practical and emotional support, so you can concentrate on your baby and your milk supply. Remember that this won’t be forever – it is a short-term investment for long-term gain. Set yourself short-term goals, e.g. 48-72 hours, then review your progress. If you are not able to increase your milk supply as much as you would like, or decide that it is not realistic to try, you can still have a close, happy feeding relationship with your baby.While you are working on your milk supply:Find skilled feeding support.LLL is here to help! You can find information about ways we can support youhere. We can also help you connect with other women who have experienced low milk supply.Track how you are doing.Keep a record of how much milk you express and the amount of formula or donated breastmilk your baby takes (if relevant) and how many wet and dirty nappies your baby produces. Tracking changes over time is useful to show how well your plan is working and can help you decide what to do next.Monitor your baby’s health and growth. Your baby needs to be weighed regularly while you are working on your milk supply. Your midwifery or health visiting team will usually do this. For more complex feeding issues, you may be referred to a local specialist infant feeding team or clinic.Any baby who is not growing as expected should be under the care of a doctor.This is because occasionally, slow growth can be caused by underlying health issues in the baby, rather than low milk supply.How milk production worksMilk production starts in the middle trimester of pregnancy. After birth, milk continues to be made in the breasts in response to milk being removed. The most common reason for low milk production is a slow start with breastfeeding – not enough milk being removed from the breasts in the early days after birth.Milk supply usually reaches its peak around four weeks after birth, with most of the increase happening in the first two weeks. If not enough milk is removed during this time, your breasts may end up making less milk than your baby needs. It may be possible to increase milk production, by removing more milk from your breasts. The earlier you start this, and the more energy you put into it, the higher your chances of making more milk. Even if more time has passed, it may still be possible to increase your milk production to some extent, but unfortunately there is no guarantee of being able to make a full milk supply.Any amount of milk you are able to produce is valuable to your baby. Breastfeeding is about much more than just milk and you can enjoy nurturing your baby at the breast, however much milk you are making.For more detailed information about how milk production works seeHow Milk Production Works.Risk factors for low milk supplyThese include:Previous breast surgery (especially reduction) or radiationRetained placentaUnusually small/thin/unequally sized/widely spaced breastsA history of infertility with hormonal causeHormonal conditions like thyroid problems or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).If you have any risk factors for low milk supply, you may be referred to an infant feeding specialist. Some of these conditions are treatable. Even if you have underlying factors that can’t be treated, you may still be able to make more milk than you are currently making.Effective attachmentA baby who isn’t deeply attached at the breast may not be able to get enough milk, and feeding may also be uncomfortable for you. Squashed (“new lipstick”) nipples after a feed, skin damage and pain that lasts throughout feeds are all signs of shallow attachment. You can read more about positioning and attachmenthere.Face to face help (including via video call) is usually best when working on attachment. If feeding doesn’t become more comfortable and/or effective even with skilled help, your baby may be referred for an oral assessment (a thorough examination of their mouth) to check for tongue tie, which is a problem for a small number of babies and can be treated. You can read more about thishereandhere.Hold your baby skin to skinThis helps your milk-making hormones to work well, keeps your baby calm and happy, helps you and your baby feel connected and encourages interest in feeding. You can read more about holding your baby skin to skinhere.How often and when to feedWhile you are working to increase your milk supply, you will want to encourage your baby to feed as often as possible. Signs of interest in feeding include your baby turning their head and opening their mouth (rooting), licking lips, mouthing hands, restlessness and making small sounds. Try to offer a feed when your baby is first interested, before they become upset. If your breasts are feeling full or you just feel like feeding your baby, you can offer your baby a feed, even if they are not asking.You may want to avoid using a dummy, a baby swing, or swaddling your baby, as these can make it difficult to tell if your baby is interested in feeding.Don’t give your baby water, tea or any other non-milk drinks.Breastfeeds don’t have to be regular (e.g. every 2-3 hours). Your baby just needs to have enough feeds in 24 hours, whenever they are awake enough and interested. Most young babies need at least 8-12 feeds in 24 hours. Don’t watch the clock – watch your baby and count feeds.Keep your baby feeding actively when they are at the breastKnowing when your baby is feeding actively at the breast, with deep sucks and swallowing after every one-two sucks, can be very helpful. While you are working to increase your milk supply, you will want to make sure that milk is removed from your breasts as effectively as possible. If your baby is mostly doing light, fluttery sucks with very little swallowing (three or more sucks per swallow), they are not removing much milk. If your goal is to increase the amount of milk removed from your breasts, you may want to end the feed and use a breast pump instead to maximise efficient milk removal.Breast compressions and switching sides can help to keep your baby actively feeding for longer. Start compressing your breast as soon as your baby stops actively feeding. You can read about how to do compressionshere. When your baby is no longer actively feeding even with compressions, repeat on the other side. Offer as many breasts as your baby will take – it can be more than two!Some babies seem to want to feed all the time and protest when you take them off the breast. If they are not growing well, it may be because they are not yet breastfeeding effectively. To increase your milk supply, you may temporarily need to limit their time at the breast, to give you more time to express your milk.Increasing breast stimulation by expressing your milkIf the steps above do not result in increased milk supply, the next step is to increase stimulation of your breasts by expressing your milk:An LLL Leader and/or your local infant feeding specialist will agree with you how many times in 24 hours to aim for at first. For more impact, you can increase the number of sessions. For maximum effect, you would aim to express 8-12 times in 24 hours (this is the number of times most babies need to feed).A double electric breast pump, preferably a large “hospital grade” pump, is usually the best tool for this job. Smaller single electric and manual pumps are designed for occasional expressing, not the big task of increasing milk supply.You don’t need to pump after set intervals (most babies don’t feed after set intervals either), just as often as you can. The important thing is how many times you express in 24 hours – it’s up to you when you do it. It’s fine to take a break for a few hours to go out or to sleep! More, shorter expressions often work better than fewer, longer ones and it’s fine to stop in the middle of pumping, if you need to do something. Even if you only have a few minutes, it’s worth pumping. Notice the times of day or night when you can express most and aim to pump more often then. First thing in the morning and in the quiet hours of the night can work well. Experiment to see what works best.Use your hands as well as your pump. Try massaging your breasts before and during pumping. You might want to buy or make a “hands-free pumping bra” to hold your pump in place. Some women find that they can express lots of milk by hand after they have finished pumping. You can see how to use your hands to express more milk in thisFirst Dropletsvideo.Subtitled version reproduced for LLLGB use, with permission © Dr Jane MortonTry covering the collection bottle with a sock so you can’t see it. Frustration about how slowly it is filling with milk can make it even slower!Try visualisation, e.g. a flowing fountain, or milk pouring into a bottle.Many women find that they get most milk in the first few minutes of pumping. To make the most of this, it can work well to pump very frequently for short periods, stopping and starting as many times as possible. This is sometimes called ‘power pumping’.Try pumping with a piece of your baby’s clothing near enough to smell, or while looking at your baby, or holding your baby skin to skin.You can find more tips on how to express milkhere.Balancing breastfeeding and expressingThe priority at this stage is to increase your baby’s milk intake and your milk supply.This may mean limiting your baby’s time at the breast, for now, to free up enough time to express.Your baby has lots of time to learn to breastfeed. Your milk supply will become more difficult to increase as time goes on, so it is important to act quickly. This might feel all wrong – you want to breastfeed, not pump! Remember that it is an investment of your time now to help your baby breastfeed later. As your milk supply increases, breastfeeding will get easier and more rewarding for your baby. When breastfeeding is going well, you will be able to let your baby feed as much as they want.How to feed expressed milk to your babyThere are lots of options – an LLL Leader can help you choose some to try, includingpaced bottle feedingand more,cup feeding, andat-breast supplementers(lactation aid).Keeping the breast a happy place for your babyIf your baby is upset, try offering some extra milk before offering the breast. This helps your baby to associate the breast with feeling full and happy, rather than hungry and frustrated.Babies enjoy ending a feed by falling asleep at the breast. You can offer expressed or formula milk between breasts, allowing your baby to finish with the second breast.You can give milk by bottle or cup with your baby’s cheek against your breast.If a supplementer is used, your baby can drink expressed milk while breastfeeding.DomperidoneThis is a prescription medication that can help to increase milk supply in some women, whilst they are taking the tablets. It is not suitable for everyone, e.g. it is not safe for those with certain heart conditions. Because of this, doctors are currently discouraged from prescribing domperidone to anyone. However, the NHS states that domperidone may be appropriate in some cases, so if you would like to try it, it’s worth discussing with your GP, and taking along someinformationfor them to read.The most important thing to do to increase milk supply is to remove more milk from your breasts, so don’t worry if you can’t or prefer not to take domperidone.Formula milkSome babies need extra milk for a short time or longer term if their mother is not making a full milk supply. If donated human milk is not available, the only safe alternative is infant formula milk. You can find LLLGB’s information on milk sharinghere.It is never safe tosuddenlystop or reduce supplements of formula or donor breastmilk.This needs to be done gradually, to allow your own milk supply time to increase. and it is very important that your baby is weighed regularly, to make sure that they continue to get enough milk. It would usually be appropriate to weigh your baby every 1-2 weeks while working on reducing supplements. You can read about how to use donor milk or formula to support breastfeedinghere.Whether or not you are producing all the milk your baby needs, you can still have a great feeding relationship with your baby.The breast can still work beautifully to calm, comfort and soothe your baby, even if your milk supply remains low. Any amount of your milk that your baby gets will be beneficial to them. Some of the immune components of milk become concentrated so that babies get the same amount, no matter how much of your milk they get each day. Whatever feeding looks like for you and your baby, we are here to support you.SummaryStage 1 – make sure your baby is feeding as effectively as possibleConsider risk factors for low milk supply.Make sure that your baby is well positioned and attached at the breast. This will include checking for any reason the baby might not be able to attach and feed well (e.g. tongue tie).Hold your baby skin to skin as much as possible.Offer the breast as soon as your baby shows any signs of interest in feeding, at least 8-12 times in 24 hours, waking baby if necessary.Switch sides and use breast compressions to increase milk flow.Stage 2 – if milk supply has not increased enoughExpress your milk at a frequency agreed with an LLL Leader and/or infant feeding specialist.If your baby is still not growing well, increase the number of expressions. For maximum effect, aim for at least 8 times in 24 hours. This may mean temporarily limiting your baby’s time at the breast, to give you enough time to express.Feed as much expressed milk as your baby wants to drink by cup, paced bottle-feeding, finger feeding or nursing supplementer.Aim to keep your baby’s time at the breast happy and relaxed, and to end feeds with your baby at the breast (if necessary, after giving your baby extra milk at the start or in the middle of the feed) as often as you can.Consider using the medication domperidone, which may help increase your milk supply.If necessary, use enough formula milk to make sure your baby grows as expected and seems satisfied.Further readingGetting breastfeeding back on track after a difficult startHow milk production worksMy baby needs more milkExpressing your milkRelactation and induced lactation– bringing back milk supply after a break or bringing in a milk supply when you haven’t been pregnant.BooksMaking More Milk, by Diana West & Lisa Marasco(2019)Defining Your Own Success: Breastfeeding After Breast Reduction Surgery by Diana West(2001)Breastfeeding Without Birthing by Alyssa Schnell– for non-gestational parents who are inducing lactation.Written by Jayne Joyce and Emily Tammam, LLL Oxfordshire, February 2021"
Breastfeeding at night,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-at-night/,"Breastfeeding at night is one of the most discussed topics at La Leche League meetings, both in person and online. This is often because breastfeeding at night, especially in the early days, can be so important to establishing a successful breastfeeding relationship. It is also because of its inextricable link with the topic of sleep, which can be one of the biggest changes many mothers and families experience when they have a new child.There is no doubt that caring for a new baby can be exhausting, especially if you feel you are not getting enough sleep. Understanding why breastfeeding at night is so important can help. There is a huge amount of both reliable and rather less reliable information on the internet and in countless parenting books about what infant sleep ‘ought’ to be like, and therefore what infant night-time feeding ‘ought’ to be like. This article is designed to give mothers and parents the information and reassurance they need to inform their own night-time breastfeeding approach, including some helpful tips on how to get more rest when you can.Breastfeeding at night in the early weeks and months is normal and importantBabies wake to feed at night in the early weeks and months (and often beyond) for a number of important reasons. Breastfeeding at night is a vital part of establishing and maintaining a good milk supply and ensuring that newborn babies get all the milk they need to grow and thrive. Breastmilk works on a supply and demand basis: the more milk that is removed, the more milk your breasts make. For the majority of mothers, this means milk needs to be removed roughly every 2-3 hours in the early weeks. Although some babies may sleep for slightly longer periods overnight, perhaps 3-4 hour stretches, newborn babies will typically wake several times a night to feed. This also helps to ensure that you don’t get engorged breasts, which may lead to blocked ducts or mastitis.Newborn babies often wake to feed because their bodies have signalled that they are hungry. However, newborns (and babies and children of all ages) also wake at night for many other reasons, including being scared or uncomfortable, being hot or cold, feeling the need for comfort and connection, and so on. As adults, we have developed ways of meeting these needs ourselves – adjusting a pillow, having a sip of water, cuddling our partner. As babies have no way of independently meeting these needs, they rely on their mother or parent to meet them. Breastfeeding at night offers mothers a way of easily and conveniently meeting the vast majority of these needs in one go.Lots of research shows that night waking is the biological norm for babies.iYou can read more about ithereas well as inSweet Sleep, La Leche League International’s exhaustive publication on nights and naps for breastfeeding families. Research also shows that, overall, breastfeeding mothers get more sleep than mixed- and formula-feeding mothers. This is for a number of reasons, including the impact of natural hormones and chemicals released for baby and mother when breastfeeding at night. There is also a perception that babies who have formula milk sleep longer than breastfed babies. Evidence shows this is not the case.ii“Despite the common perception that supplementing an infant’s diet with formula milk or solid food will promote sleep, a recent study found that there was no difference in the frequency of night waking between breastfeeding and formula feeding infants aged 6-12 months old. Infants who received more milk or solid feeds during the day were less likely to feed at night but not less likely to wake.”iiiBreastmilk at nightResearch shows that breastmilk changes all the time, in response to all sorts of things, like the needs and health of your baby, temperature, and the time of day. For most mothers, breastmilk will gradually increase in fat content throughout the day. During the evening, young babies often cluster feed, taking in frequent feeds of this fattier milk, which tends to satisfy them enough to have their longest stretch of sleep. This cluster feeding in the early months may go on late into the evening when you were hoping you would be asleep, which can naturally feel exhausting.Overnight, your prolactin levels – the hormone designed to support milk production – are at their highest. So, when your baby feeds frequently at night, the message to your body to boost milk supply is even stronger. Breastmilk at night is also high in the amino acid tryptophan, which in turn helps your baby to make melatonin, which is used by the body to develop its circadian rhythm (our internal system for recognising the difference between day and night) and to sleep better. Hormones produced while breastfeeding also help you to relax and fall more quickly back to sleep, which may be why you find yourself nodding off so easily while breastfeeding.Given the fact that the hormones in night-time breastmilk help you and your baby to get back to sleep quickly, feeding babies to sleep is completely natural. A mother and baby’s bodies are designed to work in tandem this way. Breastfeeding your baby to sleep helps baby feel calm, safe and secure. Over time, babies stop falling asleep at the breast so easily, and eventually all babies or children stop needing the breast to fall asleep. Sleep is not a taught development, and all children get there in their own time. So, while breastfeeding to sleep continues to work, many mothers find it a wonderful, loving and responsive way to help their children doze off.Breast-sleeping / Co-sleepingSafely sharing a bed with your baby, or having your baby sleep very close to you in a sidecar cot or similar, is one way of getting more sleep and rest. The majority of other mammals sleep with their young, and our own infants are hard-wired to expect this too. For many breastfeeding mothers, learning to feed lying down and being able to fall back asleep safely with baby is when things start to feel a lot more manageable at night. Some mothers may start out nursing their babies at night sat up in bed, but many soon find that mastering breastfeeding lying on their side can really help everyone to get more sleep, especially as baby gets a bit older and can latch on by themselves. Mums can feed from both breasts when lying on one side by simply tilting their body forwards more. The same principles for getting a comfortable, deep latch apply when side-lying as when feeding upright. It may take a little practice, but overall it’s easier and less disruptive for both mother and baby at night. Research shows that breastfeeding tends to be more successful overall for mothers that co-sleep than those that keep their baby separated from them at night. You can read more about how to co-sleep or breast-sleep safely with your babyhereBreastfeeding at night after the early monthsMany mothers go through patches where their baby may wish to breastfeed more or less at night, especially within the first year. This will be related to a whole host of reasons, including growth spurts, teething, illness, and learning new skills such as sitting, crawling and walking. Like so much else with babies and children, the frequency of breastfeeds at night is not a linear progression. Phases of increased night feedings are usually relatively short-lived and you may find that co-sleeping is a really valuable tool for managing those phases. Increased periods of waking and breastfeeding around four-six months are very common and are not a sign that your baby is hungry and needs formula and/or solids. You can read more about this in our article‘What happens at four months’As your baby gets older and bigger, you may find that night feeding becomes much easier. While in the early days you may feel the need to switch on a light or sit up in bed in order to latch your baby comfortably onto your breast, as your baby gets stronger and learns to self-latch, feeding at night can be a simple matter of rolling over and putting the breast near your baby, who will manage the rest. Night feeds often become quicker too. Some mothers use breast compressions as a way of speeding up feeds. Being able to help their older baby back to sleep quickly with a breastfeed helps many mothers get the most sleep.Coping with the challengesKnowing that waking at night to breastfeed is positive for our supply and our baby, and that it is the biological norm, can often be reassuring for mothers and parents. Nevertheless, sleep deprivation can be really challenging for many families. It can feel especially hard if your baby is waking more than your friends’ babies, or if they are an older baby still waking up more than you had expected.New parents often get asked about their babies’ sleep and their approach to feeding at night. These conversations can sometimes lead to (unwanted) comments about what is normal, what you ‘should’ be doing, and how to ‘fix’ things. And if you are feeling really tired or at a low point, you may be thinking that you do need to find a ‘solution’ and try some of those suggestions. The many unhelpful sources out there setting unrealistic expectations may be undermining your self-confidence as a mother. Perhaps you’re wondering what a loving and respectful approach that suits both you and your baby would be?First, it’s important to say that you are not alone. At any point in time there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of mothers up and breastfeeding their babies – of varying ages – at night. A turning point for some of them is when they are able to relax their expectations of themselves and their babies a little. Some mothers also find that being constantly reminded of when they have been woken up is actually part of the problem, and they decide to ignore the clock and not to use their phones at night.Being responsible for all the night-feeds can feel exhausting, or even unfair. Sometimes well-intentioned comments may suggest that a partner or other care-giver could feed the baby at night with a bottle. It can be useful to remember that the hormones in night-time milk make it easier for both you and your baby to get back to sleep quickly. And since the hormones in night-time milk are made at night-time, there is some evidence that giving your baby breastmilk expressed at other times does not always have quite the same effect. It is also sometimes easy to overlook the practicalities of another care-giver taking care of night-feeds. Mothers will often wake up when their baby does anyway, and may struggle to get back to sleep if they can hear their baby being upset while waiting for a bottle to be warmed up. Most mothers will also need to pump or hand express milk during the night to protect their supply and avoid engorgement, so they are often awake anyway during the time their baby is being fed by their partner.Even though breastfeeding at night may be the responsibility of the mother alone, there are lots of ways to get supported so that things feel easier. For example, sometimes dads and partners get up with the baby first thing in the morning to give mums some extra time in bed, which can make a big difference to how tired they feel. Good communication is really helpful – ask for help with other things where you can and be clear about the kind of support you need. It’s OK not to enjoy breastfeeding every second, and it’s OK to complain about being tired: that doesn’t mean you don’t want to do it, so you can explain that asking ‘Why don’t you just stop?’ is not helpful and that you’d rather be asked ‘How can I help you find time to rest today?’If you are really struggling with tiredness, you may want to think of ways to adapt your own routines for a short while to help you get more rest – perhaps sleeping more during the day, or going to bed earlier when your baby has her first ‘longer’ stretch of sleep. It can also be a great time to join an LLL group meeting with other breastfeeding mothers, as hearing that they are experiencing the same challenges can be really reassuring. Mothers often get bombarded with unrealistic expectations of infant sleep, and it’s precisely this misalignment of expectation and reality that can cause stress.Another challenge that mothers may experience (usually once their baby is a bit older) is a feeling of nursing aversion or irritability, particularly during night-time feeds. These feelings can be very normal and are often linked to tiredness or feeling ‘touched out’. You may experience them more when your baby is waking or feeding a lot more frequently, for example when teething or feeling ill. You may also experience these feelings when there is a change in your own hormones, for example, during ovulation or your period. There is some anecdotal evidence that taking magnesium supplements can be helpful. Many mothers describe these feelings as irrational and usually short-lived; they can be a sign that you need to give yourself a little ‘self-care’ – perhaps asking for some more help during the day so that you can rest or focus on yourself.Nursing aversion can sometimes lead to feelings of guilt about not enjoying breastfeeding, and make you wonder whether it is a sign you need to stop. There are some helpful information groups on social media where mothers share their nursing aversion experiences, as well as tips and tricks that helped them overcome those feelings. Like anything in life, you may not enjoy breastfeeding every moment of every day; that’s OK. Take things one day at a time, listen to your body and your baby.Stopping breastfeeding at nightBreastfeeding at night meets a baby’s needs in a variety of ways. For many mothers, it’s the easiest way to settle their baby back to sleep when they wake at night, and they continue to use it for as long as it continues to work. It is not a bad habit and all babies eventually fall asleep and stay asleep without the breast. You may decide that you are happy with breastfeeding back to sleep, but you are feeling pressured by others’ expectations about what your baby ‘should’ be doing.Some books suggest that after six months babies no longer need night feeds. Not only is this an arbitrary figure, taking little account of the different circumstances of different babies and families, but it also has no evidence to back it up. Sometimes, mothers worry that breastfeeding at night is what is causing their baby to wake up several times. This is not the case. Babies wake for lots of reasons and it is better to think of breastfeeding as a tool that meets the vast majority of those needs. Some sources claim that babies after a certain age don’t ‘need’ breastmilk at night any longer, but breastfeeding goes on meeting a baby’s needs for a long time. Many babies will continue to need the calories from night-time breastmilk, as well as all the other comforts that it brings, for some time after six months, and sometimes well beyond.Some families may feel that their baby is ready to cut some breastfeeds at night or stop breastfeeding at night altogether. Generally speaking, the evidence seems to suggest that night-weaning is best left until after around 18 months. Many mothers find that gently cutting down feeds at this point is much easier, as the baby is learning to talk and the mother can help to explain any changes. There is helpful information about approaches to cutting down night feedshere. Any changes are best approached gradually and respectfully, so that you can preserve the important close connection to the baby at night-time. As your baby gets older, you will discover ways of being responsive to their needs at night that might not include offering your breast every time. For example, you may find that you are able to try other things like rocking, patting and shushing before offering the breast. These may not work initially, but over time, as your baby develops, you may find that in some cases these soothe him back to sleep. As always, you are the expert on your baby and you’ll be able to assess whether your child is ready to stop breastfeeding at night, or whether it would be easier to try night weaning later on.ConclusionHaving a baby, and eventually a toddler, can of course be exhausting. Since responding to your baby’s intense needs at night can feel overwhelming, being able to access reliable information about infant sleep and night-time feeding behaviour can help you adjust your expectations. You may be happy breastfeeding your baby back to sleep as often as needed, yet you may feel pressured by well-meaning comments from friends and family about what your baby’s sleep ‘should’ be like. Sometimes spending time with others who understand what you’re going through, and who are supportive or your choices, can help you feel confident to make the decisions that work for you. Chatting with other mothers at a La Leche League meeting, in person or online, about what they found helpful, and exchanging ideas for getting more sleep may help you decide what’s right for you and your baby.

Breastfeeding and Vitamin D,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-and-vitamin-d/,"Vitamin D is a key nutrient in the maintenance of bone health in children and adults. It helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy.Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency may contribute to a number of health issues such as hypertension, diabetes type I and II, some autoimmune conditions, and some cancers.iBecause vitamin D is essential for promoting calcium absorption in the body, in a relatively small number of cases its deficiency can also lead to rickets in children, a condition that affects bone development, causing the bones to become soft and weak and potentially leading to bone deformities. In adults, rickets is known as osteomalacia or soft bones and it can lead to osteoporosis if left unchecked long term.iiBreastmilk doesn’t naturally contain high levels of vitamin D as, in the past, babies would absorb most of their vitamin D from exposure to sunlight. However, changes in the way we live our lives, with less exposure to sunlight and only a few of the foods we eat containing vitamin D (such as egg yolk, beef liver, oily fish like mackerel, tuna and salmon, as well as fortified foods like some breakfast cereals, fat spreads, and non-dairy milk alternatives), might mean that mothers may not have enough vitamin D in their own bodies to pass to their babies via breastmilk. Current recommendations that babies are not exposed to strong direct sunlight have also led to a decrease in their absorption of vitamin D. When this is combined with a mother having low levels, it further reduces the amount that passes through breastmilk.iiiGuidelines for Vitamin D intakeIn July 2016 Public Health England issued new guidelines on Vitamin D intake,ivbased on recommendations from the Government’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN). The guidelines state that although roughly one in five people has low vitamin D levels, this is not the same as a vitamin D deficiency, and most people are being asked to consider taking supplements. Specifically, PHE suggests that adults and children over the age of one consider taking a daily supplement containing 10 microgramsv(400 IU) of vitamin D, particularly during autumn and winter when the sun is not strong enough.Although some people choose not to take a supplement during the summer months when they are exposed to adequate sunshine, people who have a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, are being advised to take a supplement all year round. According to SACN’s review, at-risk groups include people whose skin gets little or no exposure to the sun, such as people who are not often outdoors or who cover their skin when they are outside. People with dark skin, from African, African-Caribbean and South Asian backgrounds, may also not get enough vitamin D from sunlight in the summer and may also want to consider taking a supplement all year round.Can I get enough Vitamin D from sunlight?Our bodies are designed to make very large amounts of vitamin D through exposure to the sun (10,000-20,000 IU in 24 hours, after 15-20 minutes of summer-sun exposure in a bathing suit or 45-60 minutes of exposure for people with darker skin tones). However, the desire to avoid overexposure and sunburn has eclipsed the ability of both children and adults to absorb adequate amounts of sunlight to keep normal levels of vitamin D.viThe NHS website says, “Most people can make enough vitamin D from being out in the sun daily for short periods with their forearms, hands or lower legs uncovered and without sunscreen from late March or early April to the end of September, especially from 11am to 3pm.A short period of time in the sun means just a few minutes – about 10 to 15 minutes is enough for most lighter-skinned people – and is less than the time it takes you to start going red or burn. Exposing yourself for longer is unlikely to provide any additional benefits.People with dark skin, such as those of African, African-Caribbean or south Asian origin, will need to spend longer in the sun to produce the same amount of vitamin D as someone with lighter skin”.viiHowever, SACN didn’t make any specific recommendations about how much sunlight people would need to get enough vitamin D, because there are a number of factors that can affect how much vitamin D is produced in the skin. For example, those living in northern climates don’t have as much chance to absorb vitamin D. Therefore, the recommendations assume “minimal sunshine exposure”.The NHS website goes on to say that it’s important not to burn in the sun and that young babies should not be exposed to strong direct sunlight. Sitting indoors by a sunny window doesn’t aid vitamin D production, as the ultraviolet B (UVB) rays can’t get through glass. Neither are sunbeds a recommended way of making vitamin D.Does my baby need Vitamin D supplements?The Department of Health currently recommends that all babies from birth to one year of age (including breastfed babies and formula-fed babies who have less than 500ml a day of infant formula, already fortified with vitamin D) and all children aged one to four years are given a supplement, whether or not you are taking a supplement yourself.Babies up to the age of one year need 8.5 to 10 micrograms (340-400 IU) of vitamin D a day. Children from the age of one year need 10 micrograms (400 IU) of vitamin D a day.The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM), a global organisation of medical doctors dedicated to the promotion of breastfeeding, recommends that“The breastfeeding infant should receive vitamin D supplementation for a year, beginning shortly after birth in doses of 10–20 mcg/day (400–800 IU/day). This supplement should be cholecalciferol, vitamin D3, because of superior absorption unless a vegetable source such as ergocaliferol vitamin D2, is desired4…”viiiKnowing that human milk is designed specifically for your baby, and is the most complete food both nutritionally and immunologically, it may seem confusing to be told a breastfed baby needs vitamin D supplements. If you choose to supplement your baby and are uncomfortable with supplementation of vitamins other than D (since your milk alone provides optimal amounts of those other nutrients), ask your doctor to recommend a vitamin D-only preparation for your baby.Can I take Vitamin D instead of giving to my baby?The ABM states that“Vitamin D also may be delivered adequately through human milk.”ixSome mothers find it preferable to take the supplement themselves rather than trying to give it directly to the baby,xalso because supplementing the baby does not address any potential deficiency in the mother, which may compromise her long-term health.According toLa Leche League International, breastfeeding mothers who have adequate amounts of vitamin D in their bodies can successfully provide enough vitamin D for their nursing children through breastmilk. However, as lifestyle changes have led to some women not having enough vitamin D, LLLI recommends that pregnant and nursing mothers obtain adequate vitamin D, or supplement as necessary.Research shows that high dose maternal vitamin D supplementation (4000-6400 IU/day or a single monthly dosage of 150,000 IU) can enrich breastmilk adequately for infants.xiOne study suggested that maternal supplementation alone may improve vitamin D intake of the nursing infant in an environment where infant supplementation rate is low.xiiAs the currently recommended safe upper limit for vitamin D intake is 4000 IU/day, it is very important to check with your doctor and have your own vitamin D status assessed by a blood test before you begin supplementing at levels higher than the current RDI of 400 IU/ day.Debates continue over what an optimal level of vitamin D is for an adult, and research has indicated that pregnant and lactating women might need more vitamin D than adults who are not bearing children.xiiiIf you are not sure whether you need a supplement, you can have a simple blood test before making a choice to supplement. Vitamin D insufficiency is represented by a blood level of less than 32 ng/mL. Those with blood levels below 20 ng/mL are considered deficient in vitamin D.xivYou may also opt to have your baby’s vitamin D level assessed with a blood test measuring 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH-D). Your baby’s doctor can help you determine whether vitamin D supplements are, indeed, warranted.Study supports maternal Vitamin D SupplementationA 2015 study by Professor Bruce Hollis, PhD, of the Medical University of South Carolina, found that “maternal vitamin D supplementation with 6400 IU/day safely supplies breast milk with adequate vitamin D to satisfy her nursing infant’s requirement and offers an alternate strategy to direct infant supplementation”.xvWhen asked by La Leche League GB if mothers should continue to take supplements once their babies were over six months old, Professor Hollis replied“The mother should continue to take the vitamin D as long as she is lactating.”He added this was because of the lack of Vitamin D in most foods.xviIf a baby is born with a deficiency in Vitamin D, due to the mother’s own low levels, this may not be reversed by the mother taking supplements.xviiToo much or too little?While there is no risk of your body making too much vitamin D from sun exposure (although the usual precautions should be taken to cover or protect skin before it turns red or starts to burn), you could get too much vitamin D through supplements. The NHS says that taking too many vitamin D supplements over a long period of time can cause too much calcium to build up in the body (hypercalcaemia). This can weaken the bones and damage the kidneys and the heart.If you choose to take vitamin D supplements, 10 micrograms (400 IU) a day is likely to be enough for most people, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly, and children aged 11 to 17 years. Children aged one to ten years should not have more than 50 micrograms (2,000 IU) a day. Infants under 12 months should not have more than 25 micrograms (1,000 IU) a day. Some people have medical conditions that mean they may not be able to safely take as much. If in doubt, you should consult a health professional to get up-to-date information on recommended doses. A medical professional will also be able to help you assess whether taking more than 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) of Vitamin D a day to provide enough for your baby through breastmilk may be harmful in your specific circumstances.Breastfeeding continues to be of significanceBreastmilk remains the optimal choice for infant nutrition, and its unique structure and functions cannot by replicated by infant formula. Your milk continually adapts throughout the day and over time to suit your baby’s needs. Human milk remains the best source of nutrition during the first year, with the appropriate introduction of complementary foods from around the age of six months, which can include foods rich in vitamin D.Your milk becomes a supplement to solids during your baby’s second year, but keeps significant nutritional value, as well as emotional benefits. There is evidence that the longer a baby is breastfed, the greater the protection from ill health and the more positive impact on their long-term health (UNICEF 2012).xviiiLow levels of Vitamin D may cause problems, not breastfeedingSome research published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2016 implied that a lack of vitamin D in breastmilk may contribute to the development of rickets.xixWhile reports occasionally give the impression that breastfeeding is causing problems, the real issue is that in today’s world women may not have enough Vitamin D themselves to pass to their babies through breastmilk.The answer is to address any possible deficiencies in that area so that babies will receive the Vitamin D they need, whether this is via Vitamin D supplements and/or regular, small amounts of exposure to sunlight, as well as through their diet once they’re old enough to have complementary foods.Coronavirus updateAlterations to our normal routine may mean that at present people may be spending more time indoors and not getting enough vitamin D. The Department of Health says people might want to consider taking 10 micrograms (400 IU) of vitamin D a day to keep their bones and muscles healthy.Compiled by Anna Burbidge for La Leche League GB, January 2021Endnotesihttps://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/vitamin-d/iiIbidemiiihttps://www.vitamindcouncil.org/further-topics/vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding/#ivScientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition: “Vitamin D and Health”, 2016 (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537616/SACN_Vitamin_D_and_Health_report.pdf)vA microgram (mcg) is 1,000 times smaller than a milligram (mg).vihttps://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/vitamin-d/viihttp://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Summerhealth/Pages/vitamin-D-sunlight.aspxviiiAcademy of Breastfeeding Medicine, “ABM Clinical Protocol #29: Iron, Zinc, and Vitamin D Supplementation During Breastfeeding”,Breastfeeding Medicine 2018, 13 (6): 398-404.

After weaning – what next?,https://laleche.org.uk/after-weaning-what-next/,"Breastfeeding always comes to an end – at some point, every breastfed baby or child stops breastfeeding. This article looks at what happensafteryour toddler or older child weans,1how it feels for you and what it might mean for you going forward.Sometimes, because of difficulties, breastfeeding your baby comes to an end much earlier than you thought it would or than you had hoped for. And with that can come feelings of anger, guilt, sadness, hurt and disappointment. If you are currently struggling with breastfeeding ending earlier than you had hoped, we would encourage you to talk to someone – your local LLL Leader would be pleased to support you. You may also find this article of interest:Five ways to help when breastfeeding doesn’t go as expected. Amy Brown’s bookWhy Breastfeeding Grief and Trauma Matterwhich explores the deep feelings women have when breastfeeding doesn’t go to plan, may also be helpful.Will weaning happen?What is certain is that all children stop breastfeeding eventually. Children outgrow breastfeeding on their own, just as they outgrow other toddler and young child behaviours. For many families, taking the approach of being led by your child works well and the transition from breastfeeding to no longer breastfeeding is uneventful. It may all feel less noticeable if weaning takes place slowly and gently.This process of ‘natural weaning’ allows a child to develop at their own pace, giving up breastfeeding according to their own natural timing. Rather than choosing a specific time to stop breastfeeding, many mothers just continue nursing while it is working well for them and see how it goes. That might mean breastfeeding for years beyond what you expected as you first breastfed your newborn.Once weaning has happenedIf you are following your child’s lead, it is unlikely they will wean suddenly or overnight, especially if they are under one year old (see our article onNursing Strikesif you are concerned this is happening). It is really common for the natural weaning process to take a long time and feel like a few steps forward and a few back. This can feel confusing at times.It’s not uncommon for children to look like they are weaning, only to come back – often with renewed energy – to breastfeed when you least expect it or when you thought they had weaned. A new baby, an unsettled family time, a change in their days such as whenstarting preschool or school, or illness can often lead to an increase in breastfeeding just when you thought they were stopping. That can be unsettling if you are trying to decide if you are still breastfeeding or not – one day you might not be, and then the next you are again. One mother said: “I thought she was weaning and I was starting to feel the grief of it around three years old, but we are still going at four.”.‘The Last Breastfeed’ might not be a significant event. For some, weaning happens so gradually, that suddenly you realise your child hasn’t asked to nurse for a while, and you can’t remember your last breastfeed – or at least, you didn’t know it was the last time.This is often the time mothers wish they had captured more photographic memories of their toddler or child breastfeeding, not realising that soon it might be the last breastfeed. Taking photos of you and your child nursing can be really special, so you may want to consider taking more at this stage.Emotional changeThe topic of what it feels like after weaning isn’t talked about much and so you might be wondering if what you are feeling is normal. It almost always is.For many, weaning is an emotional adjustmentAs breastfeeding comes to end it can be an emotional time and mothers can experience a wide range of feelings. For some it might be a time of sadness – a sense of loss for the time that’s gone before and a sorrow that your special ‘baby days’ are passing and behind you. For others it might be a huge relief and a time you had longed for and thought would never come.Or it might be a mix of both.Perhaps one moment you may feel a sense of relief that the intensity of breastfeeding is passing and the next moment sad that this stage of motherhood is drawing to a close when it has been so important to you.The Womanly Art of Breastfeedingsays: “You may revel in your non-nursing status but also feel weepy or supersensitive for a time.”2One mother described the time of her two year old weaning as a confusing time of feeling a sense of loss but also happiness: grief and relief. Another, as her four year old weaned, said that she was completely ready to stop (and was desperate to), but then realised it meant she had to redefine how she viewed herself as she always thought of herself as a breastfeeding mother.This huge mix of emotions around your breastfeeding journey coming to an end is common. Especially if you worked so hard to make it happen in the early days. When breastfeeding has been such a central part of how you have mothered your child, it can feel like a new and perhaps uncertain stage.Distress around weaning is more likely the earlier it happens, or where it happened before you wanted or had intended. Where weaning has happened very early on, mothers can be left with deep feelings of anger, grief, sadness and disappointment. Where weaning has happened suddenly, or has been stressful, it is more likely that the emotional impact may be greater. How old your child is when they wean may not be as important to how you feel about weaning, rather the sense that things ended well. As Diane Bengson says: “Mothers who wean gradually, or who feel that weaning happened at a time when both they and their child were ready, often feel peace and contentment when weaning is complete3But even if you initiated weaning or encouraged your child to wean, you may still find moments of sadness. Even when weaning is a positive experience for both of you, ‘letting go’ can still feel emotional. Some mothers and parents describe it as nostalgia for the early times of breastfeeding your baby. Perhaps this is even more apparent if you know this is your last baby and you know you won’t be a nursing mother again.If you felt that your child initiated weaning rather than you did, and it was sooner than you had hoped for, those feeling of sadness can be stronger. Or if your toddler or older child weaned quickly, you may feel a sense of hurt or rejection. InThe Nursing Mother’s Guide to Weaning, Kathleen Huggens says:“ Even if you had planned to wean soon, you may feel surprised and a little disappointed when your child rejects you in favour of a cup or bottle.”4Or you may actually feel nothing but relief – that you are pleased to be moving on from the intensity of the early days and years and enjoying a sense of having your body back. You might be relieved to finally ditch your nursing bras and look forward to wearing clothes that no longer need easy access. You may find a sense of relief that you can sit down without being asked to nurse, and that maybe that intense need for you is easing a little – and that feels good.The key is that whatever you are feeling emotionally about weaning – it’s normal. What one mother experiences won’t necessarily be the same as another. Talking about it with others who have weaned at LLL groups (in person or online), might help.Hormonal ChangesWhen weaning happens, there is alsoa physical and hormonal adjustmentwhich, despite limited studies on the subject, seems to reflect across the experience of many. This adjustment can lead to a short time of feeling quite low, as your hormones settle down.It can be really common to feel down or weepy – or even depressed – after weaning. And for some, the feelings are strong and may mean there is a sense of anxiety, insomnia, anger, swings between high and low moods. In part, this is because of hormonal changes happening in your body as you adjust to reducing, and then no longer, making milk or having the repeated closeness of your child at your breast. Your breasts may still continue to produce milk, but gradually they will stop and for some mothers it might be months before they can no longer squeeze a few drops out.There is little research on the topic, but we know that the hormones so important in breastfeeding – prolactin (milk making hormone) and oxytocin (the hormone of love and responsible for the milk ejection reflex) – play an important role in how we feel emotionally. Both oxytocin and prolactin contribute to feelings of calm, love, relaxation, closeness and contentment. As breastfeeding ends, both prolactin and oxytocin levels will lower – and so may your mood and sense of wellbeing. It may last a few days, or it may go on for longer.So if you are feeling low or weepy after weaning, it can be reassuring to know that it is likely that your body is also dealing with hormonal changes, as well as any emotions you may have around weaning. Even if you are totally at peace with weaning and know the time is right for you both, there are changes happening in your body that might have an impact on how you feel.It has often been described as similar to how you feel hormonally as part of your menstrual cycle, but more intense and more long lasting. Others may go further and say that they feel really sad and depressed for a few weeks after weaning. Often your hormones settle within a few weeks and you and your child adjust to a new rhythm where breastfeeding is no longer part of your current story.These feelings of sadness and general lowness that can happen after weaning are normally temporary. Being gentle and patient with yourself is important. If you have ongoing low mood or depression after the initial weeks, it may be helpful to talk to your GP.How do I do ‘this’ without breastfeeding?If your child has stopped breastfeeding gradually or they have led the weaning process, you may see this as all part of the bigger picture of watching your child grow into an independent little person. Your role of mothering ‘your baby’ is changing. Perhaps your child is spending longer away from you, may be sleeping longer or on their own, and maybe there is a sense that their need for you isn’t quite so intense. That can be both a relief and an adjustment.You may feel proud of how they have grown and how much you have learnt about parenting through breastfeeding, but perhaps wonder what it means for you if you no longer have breastfeeding in the picture. Perhaps you are relieved that your breasts are no longer the focal point of your child’s day?Where breastfeeding has been important to you both, it can sometimes feel a bit uncertain about how things might go without nursing as a go-to or back-up for when parenting is tricky. How will you get them back to sleep if they wake with a bad dream in the middle of the night? How will you calm them down when the emotional whirlwind takes over them? What will you do when they bump themselves? How will you get some extra time in bed in the morning if your breast no longer offers the oasis of calm it once did?Often looking back at all your breastfeeding relationship gave you and your child, can help shape your ‘new’ picture of parenting without breastfeeding. Many mothers would say that breastfeeding their baby beyond babyhood is one of their proudest and greatest achievements. If that is the case, it might feel right to celebrate or mark the event in some way for you that feels significant – for both you and and your child. Be proud!And if you are feeling low, or missing that physical closeness, sometimes finding other ways to connect on a physical level with your child can help. If your arms are feeling “empty” without your child nursing at the breast, cuddling lots, having baths together and playing physical games with them climbing on you or rolling around together, can help with getting a hormone boost. Simple cuddles and touch, or sniffing or nuzzling your child’s head, can work wonders for having a surge of oxytocin.It’s likely your breasts and chest will be a special place for your child for a long time. Many mothers have commented how their older child still likes to place their head or hand near their breast, or when upset, will cuddle into a breastfeeding position without actually breastfeeding.Looking aheadAs you watch your child wean – be it entirely on their own, or with some gentle encouragement from you – you may find that you swing between various emotions and thoughts. Whether weaning passed uneventfully and feels like a natural end to your breastfeeding journey, or you found it an emotional and challenging time, looking back and acknowledging what you achieved and what you have given your child is something you can be rightly proud of.Breastfeeding has taught you so much about recognising your child’s needs and emotions, their demands and their wants. Your ability to nurture them, to read their cues and respond to them hasn’t changed, but it might be that instead of offering the breast, you now meet those needs in different ways. And while your baby may no longer need comfort at your breast, they still need you.Many mothers and parents look at their older children, even grown-up children, and know that the shape of their relationship has its foundation back in their nursing days. The closeness, understanding and connection that you grew together at the breast over the years, will continue – in new and different ways but shaped by your breastfeeding journey.EndnotesWeaning here describes the process of stopping breastfeeding, not the introduction of family foods which takes place around the middle of your baby’s first year.La Leche League International.The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. 8th Edition, 2010: 337.Bengson, D.

What happens at four months?,https://laleche.org.uk/what-happens-at-four-months/,"After the first three months, many mothers start to settle into a bit of a rhythm with their baby and begin to feel like life has become a bit more predictable. Then around four months (or anywhere between three and six months), babies seem to change all over again, sometimes becoming more fussy, sleeping differently, and often being more distractible when nursing.These outward differences are a sign of the big developmental changes happening in your baby right now. Sometimes this period lasts a couple of weeks, sometimes longer. Nursing is still very important to your baby and you can find imaginative ways to keep him nursing effectively, even with all the excitement of the world around him. This phase does pass, and babies emerge much better able to multi-task and to nurse while doing other things.So what happens to a baby at this time?Every baby is different, and as with so many other developments, every child does things at their own pace. Around four months you might be witnessing the beginning of lots of changes in your baby’s physical abilities. They might have much better head control and they may be able to sit up when supported. You might also notice more social skills developing, such as smiling, cooing or babbling. Babies may also start bringing their hands to their mouth simply to explore and play, so it may not always be a feeding cue, as it was in the past. There are lots of changes on the inside too, as their brain develops: their vision is now much better, and they can more easily pick out different sounds. Sometimes babies may also start teething at this age, which can occasionally lead to temporary changes in nursing behaviour.Distractibility while nursingThe impacts of these changes can often be felt in the breastfeeding relationship. It may seem as if your baby has started nursing for much shorter periods of time. As babies get older they become much more efficient feeders, and a feed that may previously have lasted around half an hour may now take a significantly shorter time. However, the distractibility that starts at around four months for some babies may mean breastfeeds become more sporadic, especially during the day. Babies might suckle for a few moments, then turn their head at a new sound, go back to nursing, then stop to smile at mum. You may feel worried that your baby isn’t getting full feeds, especially during the day.You can find ways to help baby to have longer/fuller feeds. For example, some mothers take their baby to a quiet or darkened room to nurse. This helps by reducing the amount of distraction so that the baby can focus on nursing. Similarly, some mums try feeding in a sling, or with a cover like a muslin, so that their baby can be less distracted by what’s going on. Other mothers find that gentle movement, like bouncing on a birth ball or sitting in a spinning chair, help to keep the baby focused.In some cases, no matter what you do, daytime feeds are just less effective for a while. So, instead, you may want to focus on getting a good feed at nap times when baby may feed to sleep. Night-time nursing becomes really important too. Perhaps because it is already dark and quiet and babies are more sleepy, many mums find that their baby often feeds better at night during this time. While it may be worrying if your baby is taking less milk during daytime feeds, it is often helpful to think about their intake over a 24-hour period. Many babies instinctively take more milk at night anyway (sometimes referred to as reverse cycling) if they are nursing less in the day.You may find this distractible period hard, because your baby no longer seems comforted by the breast to the same extent, and instead seems eager to do other things. Rest assured, your baby still loves you and enjoys your milk; you are still the centre of their world. It is just that your baby’s brain is changing in wonderful ways and it has not yet matured enough to allow them to multi-task effectively. This phase will pass and your nursing relationship can continue for as long as you wish.Nursing mannersSometimes a distractible baby might start to suckle, and then twist their head to look at something interesting, which can be painful! Some mothers find it useful to begin nudging babies towards gentle nursing behaviour at this time. If baby pulls away without unlatching, mothers can gently unlatch baby and remind them that they can’t nurse and turn their head. Even though they can’t speak their understanding is growing all the time, and by repeating these messages babies understand what behaviours are acceptable.Changes in sleepAs well as nursing differently, other things like sleep can be affected. A baby that may have been sleeping longer stretches may start waking more frequently at this time. Brain developments at this stage may mean they spend less time in the deeper phases of sleep. Research shows that sleep is not a linear development and it’s common for babies and children to go through periods of more and less frequent waking. Babies will wake for lots of reasons. Sometimes because they are hungry (especially if they have nursed less during the day), but also because they are processing new experiences from the day, because of separation anxiety, illness, or simply to feel a connection with a caregiver. Teething pain can be another reason: babies may have uncomfortable gums and may wish to nurse more for pain relief, particularly at night when there is less to distract them.This can be a tiring period for mothers and parents. You may want to make some short-term changes to catch up on rest – perhaps going to bed earlier, finding a chance to nap during the day, or choosing to co-sleep with your nursling.Not the time to introduce solidsThere is a common myth that exclusively breastfed babies who are nursing less and waking more around this time might be doing so because they are hungry and breastmilk is no longer enough for them. This is not true. For the exclusively breastfed baby, breastmilk is the only source of nutrition required until at least the middle of the first year, and well beyond in conjunction with solid food. There is no need to introduce formula milk at this time. There is no evidence that introducing baby-rice or thickeners will help babies to sleep better. In fact, it may be harmful to introduce solid food before your baby’s gut has fully matured.As babies get bigger and become able to reach and grasp for things, they may start to grab the food that you are eating. Babies also start to use their hands much more to experiment and will frequently put their hands in their mouth. Again, these are not a sign that they are ready for solid food. Getting teeth through is also not a sign that your baby is ready for solids or that he no longer needs to nurse. Evidence suggests it is better to wait until baby is showing other signs of being ready for solids, like being able to sit up unaided for short periods of time. You can read more about starting solid foodhere.The UK Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby’s life and states that breastfeeding can continue to benefit your baby along with solid foods for many months after.The World Health Organizationstrongly recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and it states that after that breastfeeding should continue, along with complementary foods, for up to the age of two years or beyond and as long as mutually desired.Distractible older babySometimes babies can also become distractible between around eight and ten months. Again, this is related to normal developments that the child is going through. Sometimes parents think distractible babies at this age are weaning. Research shows that it is very unlikely that a baby under one year will self-wean. Nursing remains very important to your baby. Many of the same tactics that worked for a four-month-old may work again; for example, keeping external stimulus limited when nursing. An eight-ten month old baby will be drinking water and having some solid foods, and you may find they eat more or less during this period. Babies may also wish to nurse more at night for a while.SummaryFor some babies the developmental changes that happen around four months mean that they may become more distractible while nursing. Nursing is still very important to your baby and sometimes you may need to try some imaginative solutions for a short period in order to help your baby get full feeds. Babies may also begin to experiment with their hands in their mouth a lot more, or reach for food. This does not necessarily mean your baby is hungry, or that thickeners, baby rice or solids need to be introduced. Research shows that waiting until at least the middle of the first year is ideal to ensure your baby’s gut has matured.As with so much else, this is a phase that will pass. If you’re finding it tricky and you’d like some support, or simply to hear from other breastfeeding mothers in similar situations, you might like to join your local La Leche League Group.

When a Breastfeeding Mother is called as a Court Witness,https://laleche.org.uk/when-a-breastfeeding-mother-is-called-as-a-court-witness/,"If a breastfeeding mother is summonsed to take part in jury service, she can ask for this to be deferred. See our articleBreastfeeding and Jury ServiceHowever, sometimes a breastfeeding mother is summonsed as a witness in a court case, either because she has previously provided evidence in a criminal or civil case, or because of involvement in her professional work life. It may be that she has been a witness to a road traffic accident which results in civil proceedings. In this case, either party could request a summons for her to attend.This article addresses some of the questions that arise from this.I’m on maternity leave, can I still be asked to attend court?If you are summonsed as a witness in a case, this is subject to court procedure rules and is a different situation to being asked to go into work. It’s considered a public duty and it could be that the evidence you will provide will have a crucial effect on the outcome of the case.  This may particularly apply in the areas of social work and family cases where the input you are able to give could be of crucial assistance to the judge, and the decisions made about another family’s life.  It is worth checking with your work colleagues if this is the case or if someone else might be able to attend in your place.Can’t I give a video testimony?This is rarely possible but, even if it is, you may still have to attend court just in case, on the day, other parties in the case wish to question you.I can’t leave my breastfed babyAlthough you almost certainly have to attend, you can request that special accommodation be made to keep you and the baby together, therefore maximising the quality of your evidence. In the first instance it will be worth talking to the barrister and solicitor representing the side of the case you have been called to give evidence for. This might include a representative from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in a criminal case, or a representative for the local authority in a family matter.You can explain that you need the baby to be with you to be able to breastfeed.  As with the situation if you were called for Jury Service, you can point out the possible risks from being separated from your baby, such as developing engorgement or mastitis, a very painful condition, if you are unable to feed your baby.The stress of being separated from your baby, along with discomfort and anxiety, may mean it will be hard for you to give optimal evidence.  You can explain that if provision is not made for your situation, it could lead to you feeling ill and this is unfair to both you and the family concerned.Risks for the baby include the unavailability of breastfeeding to provide nourishment and comfort.  It is often assumed that a baby can just take milk from a bottle, but the action of feeding is very different and many cannot adjust.  A baby should not have to have formula against a mother’s wishes, and it takes time to build up an adequate supply of expressed milk. The baby may feel emotional distress being away from his mother.Being separated will also mean that milk supply will drop down with consequences for the future. It may take time for the mother to increase her supply once more, and lead to distress for her and the baby.Judges’ Procedural Rules can be applied to allow you to be with your babyJudges have procedural rules around settling witnesses who have breastfed and special accommodations can be made to keep you and your baby together. The judge needs to balance the needs of the mother and baby against the interests of justice, which require hearing from the witness.Babies in arms can be admitted into court rooms and can even be held and fed by a mother whilst she is giving evidence. Although this is up to the individual judge, they are required to be fair and they have other judges overseeing them to whom complaints can be made if necessary.A public document calledThe Equal Treatment Bench Book explains how a judge should approach this.iIt states that “consideration should always be given to accommodating pregnant and new and breastfeeding mothers in any proceedings, whether they are parties, witnesses or representatives”.“This may include sensitive listings, start and finish times and breaks during the proceedings, sometimes resulting in a case going part-heard”.“A woman who is heavily pregnant or who has just given birth should not be expected to attend a court or tribunal unless she feels able to do so. […] this is likely to apply to at least the month before birth and at least two months after the birth. The period would be longer if there were complications at birth.  Even a telephone hearing may be too difficult if the mother is looking after the baby on her own. This may mean that a hearing has to be adjourned”.“Breaks should be allowed for breastfeeding, having checked with the mother as to the best timing”.“It may be possible to conduct a hearing with a baby or child in the court provided the baby or child is not disrupting the hearing e.g. by crying or making a noise.  However, a hearing should not be conducted in the presence of a child unless the judge is satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances for the child to see and hear the proceedings”.Mothers’ experiences1. “I was really upset to be called at short notice as a witness. I explained I had a breastfed baby I could not leave. I was told I could have a consultation room for my mum and baby to stay in and she had the number for the social worker who was in court who could tell me when a break was needed for me to go and attend to baby. They also said I could take any other breaks I wanted and that I would need to be there for two hours and would be questioned for 75 minutes. In the event my written evidence proved enough, and I didn’t need to appear on the stand.”2. “I was called as a witness in a criminal case and my mother was allowed to go with me and my baby. We were there for two days, but in the end I wasn’t called to give evidence.  I felt reassured knowing my mother was there with my baby.”3. “I had been able to video my testimony but still had to attend for cross questioning.  However this was really brief and my baby didn’t need to nurse while I was in court.”4. “I worked in a role where I had to stand as an expert witness in court. It was emphasised that when we took on clients if that family were to go to court at any point in the coming years we would be obliged to attend, regardless of circumstances.  I left my baby with a relative the one time I had to go to court and it was hugely nerve-wracking.”SummaryWhile you most likely cannot avoid going to court if summonsed as a witness, there are procedures in place to protect you and your baby’s breastfeeding relationship. Not everyone may be aware of this, so do ask about them and explain why they are important.Written by Anna Burbidge with input from Johanna Rhys-Davies, March 2020iThe Equal Treatment Bench Book.
