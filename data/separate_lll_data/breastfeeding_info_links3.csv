Accommodating breastfeeding on return to work,https://laleche.org.uk/accommodating-breastfeeding-return-work/,"At the moment many women face difficult choices after they have had a baby.  They may have agreed to return to work when their baby is six or nine months old, and while that can seem a long way off before the birth, LLLGB has found that many women feel it comes round all too quickly. While they are enjoying breastfeeding and want to continue, many mothers feel concerned about how they will manage when they go back to paid work.Some mothers feel they are committed to returning to work and that they have no choice but to wean their babies. Breastfeeding breaks and flexible working hours could make all the difference to them.  There can also be considerable pressure on women to go back to paid work even though they would love to be at home for longer and this is an area where women also deserve support.How employers can support breastfeeding womenIn February 2014 La Leche League GB (LLLGB) reported on a new guide for employers on breastfeeding breaks in the workplace, produced by ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service).[i]Representatives from LLLGB, along with other breastfeeding organisations, provided input for this guide and they have since then continued to work with Maternity Action to develop further resources.Maternity Action subsequently produced a leaflet for employers entitledAccommodating breastfeeding on return to work.[ii]Although Parliament has still not legislated to make breastfeeding/expressing breaks in the workplace a statutory requirement, employers must meet obligations to breastfeeding employees under Health and Safety Law, Flexible Working Law and Discrimination Law.Assessing RisksWhile the law does not require employers to conduct an individual risk assessment for a breastfeeding mother, they must assess risks to new and expectant mothers arising from working conditions. They must take reasonable action to remove or reduce risks, and providing employees with breaks to breastfeed or express can be part of this effort.Employers are required by law to provide a breastfeeding mother with a place to rest, which could also be used as a room to breastfeed or express. It is also recommended that employers provide washing facilities and a clean secure fridge to store milk.Flexible Working RequestsIf a woman has worked for an employer for at least 26 weeks she can make a request for flexible working hours.  She can ask for changes to her days, hours or place of work, or to work shorter shifts, to work part-time or move from evening or night shifts to day in order to continue breastfeeding.The employer is legally required to give the request serious consideration and can only refuse for good business reasons. The employer and employee can agree to a temporary change in contract while she is breastfeeding.Planning aheadIt is good practice for an employer to have a policy on breastfeeding setting out how employees can make requests and how these would be considered.  It’s also a good idea for women to make a flexible working request at least two to three months before returning from maternity leave, or to start discussing options during pregnancy.  Sorting out breastfeeding breaks at least three weeks before the woman returns to work will help to adjust her breastfeeding routine.Equality Act 2010Under the Equality Act 2010 it is sex discrimination to fail to assess or take action on health and safety risks for a breastfeeding woman where the work could involve risks with serious consequences for mother or baby.It is also sex discrimination to harass a breastfeeding employee or to fail to take action to stop other staff members from harassing her.  This can include jokes and banter.It is indirect sex discrimination under the Equality Act for an employer to refuse a flexible working request from a breastfeeding mother if there are not good business reasons for the refusal, and if it results in the mother stopping breastfeeding.Positive resultsProviding breastfeeding or expressing breaks has positive results for both employer and employee. It has been shown that breastfed babies are sick less often than formula fed babies, so parents take fewer days off.  The Maternity Action leaflet says that parents of breastfed babies have one-third the absences of parents of formula fed babies. This saves companies money.The leaflet states that women who felt their employer was supportive were more likely to return to work, saving in recruitment costs and lost output from staff turnover.Employees working in companies which accommodate breastfeeding have also been found to have higher morale, higher productivity and overall satisfaction.Information from LLLGBYou can find more information about working and breastfeeding here:Working and breastfeedingWorkday practicalitiesWhen mum can’t be thereIf you leave your babyWhat legal rights do breastfeeding mothers have when returning to paid employment?You may also be interested in reading the bookWorking and Breastfeeding Made Simple[iii]by LLL Leader Nancy Mohrbacher.Written by Anna Burbidge for LLLGB, February 2018Notes[i]Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.Accommodating breastfeeding employees in the workplace.October 2013;http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/2/i/Acas-guide-on-accommodating-breastfeeding-in-the-workplace.pdf(accessed on 2 March 2018).[ii]Maternity Action.Accommodating breastfeeding on return to work.https://www.maternityaction.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/BORTW-employer-leaflet-FINAL.pdf(accessed 2 March 2018).[iii]Nancy Mohrbacher.

Five ways to help when breastfeeding doesn’t go as expected,https://laleche.org.uk/five-ways-help-breastfeeding-doesnt-go-expected/,"Sometimes breastfeeding doesn’t go as hoped for, or as expected. Some of those mothers, with a little support, guidance and practice, quickly move to a place of comfort and enjoyment and they don’t look back as they overcome challenges. But some don’t. Some of them need incredible determination to overcome problems and difficulties. Some go far beyond what even they thought they would do. And some reach a point where they run out of energy and emotion to keep going.What do they need from those around them?How can partners, family, friends or health professionals support them in a way that helps those who are discovering that breastfeeding isn’t going as well as they expected? Here are five areas for supporters to consider:1. Help her find the right supportUnicef has shown that eight out of 10 women stop breastfeeding before they want to. And that “For breastfeeding to work, you need someone to turn to who believes it’s important and believes you can do it.”[1] And that means helping her find a qualified, informed breastfeeding supporter; for example, an LLL Leader or other breastfeeding counsellor[2] or IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant).The first step is almost always to explore what’s happening with breastfeeding – not suggest alternatives. The cliché ‘Breastfeeding problems have breastfeeding solutions’ has great value. It’s saying that even if additional solutions are needed to overcome problems and meet the baby’s needs, the first step is to look at what’s going on with breastfeeding. Finding someone for her who can offer breastfeeding expertise and knowledge, and who will look at the mother and baby as a unit, might be the biggest act of support you can give her and the baby.Care and concern come from a good place. Of course no-one wants to see someone they love or care about struggling or distressed. And no-one, least of all the baby’s mother, wants to see a baby do anything but thrive. The first rule is always feed the baby. And helping her to find the right support to do that is the best help – to help her achieve her breastfeeding goals or make the decision to change those goals.2. Listen to herMothers and parents are already facing a society and culture where bottle-feeding is seen as the norm. By the time a baby arrives, their parents will have already been bombarded with adverts and images of the best bottles and formulas. Mothers talk about pressure to breastfeed – and also about pressure NOT to breastfeed. It can already feel like swimming against the tide for anyone who WANTS to breastfeed, even with a supportive partner.And so supporters have a huge role in helping a mother to focus on what she wants to do. Sometimes mothers will say they can’t talk to their family about difficulties anymore because they just say, out of care for her, “you’ve done so well, you could stop now”. And some say they are told that “You know you don’t have to breastfeed”. But what if she wants to?Instead, supporters can ask her what she wants to happen? Where would she like to get to with her baby? What are her goals and ideals for feeding her baby? Without knowing the answer to what she wants, those around might offer the mother solutions that don’t help her and in fact make her feel more isolated. Just like those around her, her priority will be to make sure her baby’s needs are met – she’s not breastfeeding ‘just for herself’.Sometimes someone’s reasons for struggling aren’t obvious but are deep-rooted, perhaps she is finding it hard because of hidden issues or historical experiences around her body and breasts and how she feels about herself or her body. Breastfeeding can unearth hidden hurts, complexities and sensitivities about how mothers view their bodies, their breasts and themselves. None of which may be visible or apparent to someone supporting them and yet can make them feel all the more scared and isolated if they are struggling with breastfeeding.3. Understand she is driven to breastfeed beyond what she expectedFor many mothers the instinct to breastfeed is powerful. And that drive can be really hard for supporters to understand. Mothers often say that they didn’t realise it would matter so much to them. Just as sometimes a woman has an inexplicable desire and urge to have a baby, the drive to breastfeed can often come as a surprise to the woman herself. The fundamental biological instinct to feed her baby is so ingrained in what it means to be a mother, that it is beyond words. Mothers talk about “just knowing they wanted to breastfeed”. Mothers are biologically hardwired to breastfeed their babies.Petra Hoehfurtner, LLL Leader and IBCLC, in her excellent article Breastfeeding – A Woman’s Right[3] talks about the biological drive to breastfeed and she says:“But at the end of the day – when it comes to breastfeeding – our bodies and minds are run by our instincts. Therefore, if a woman, for whatever reason doesn’t succeed in breastfeeding her baby, the sense of loss and failure goes much deeper than intellect or emotions; it connects on an instinct level… This woman has ‘failed’ the human race as she hasn’t been able to do the most basic thing: to feed her baby. This sense of failure goes much deeper than any other failure someone experiences in their life.”Mothers are driven by the biological need to make sure their baby thrives. When it doesn’t go smoothly or there are challenges, many have a single-minded commitment to making it work. Not out of any external pressure to breastfeed (though others might think that), but because they want to, because it’s what their body and mind expect to happen. And they are often surprised by the shift from “I’ll try to breastfeed if I can, but I won’t worry about it” when pregnant, to “I am determined to do this, I NEED to do this” when their baby is in their arms.Some say that they didn’t expect to feel so strongly that they wanted to make it work, and that they are finding depths of determination they didn’t know they had. And this is in the context of a culture which already makes breastfeeding complicated in so many ways.One determined mother said:“Breastfeeding was something I knew I wanted to do but it was only when I found I had supply issues I discovered that I was willing to walk to the end of the Earth to try to make it work. Rationally I knew she would be fine with formula supplements, but something altogether deeper took over and I found I was willing to do practically anything to return her to being exclusively breastfed as soon as possible.”For some, that will mean days or weeks of struggling and then they get to a place where breastfeeding is what they had hoped for, and they are so relieved that they didn’t stop. And they are rightly proud of what they have achieved.And for others, they get to the point, where they make the decision to stop or her goals evolve so that she gets to a place where she is satisfied: even if it is different from what she first hoped for. Only she can make that decision if she is to gain any sense of peace with it. She has to know it’s her choice. And it might be that her goals may change.4. Tell her it’s okay to be angryAs a supporter, giving a mother space to be angry can be liberating for them. They might feel angry that system has let her down. Many who are struggling with breastfeeding have been failed at some point, by not getting the skilled support and information they needed in the early days. Or worse, that their breastfeeding relationship has been sabotaged by ill-informed support or care in the early days or weeks.They may have been told “that latch looks fine” but are still in pain or the baby is hardly swallowing, or “only feed your baby from one breast to get the really good milk” or “only feed every three hours to make sure your baby is really hungry”: all common advice which is likely to undo the breastfeeding relationship. Or when their baby fails to gain weight, they are referred to a paediatrician to find out what’s wrong with the baby, rather than anyone looking at what’s happening with breastfeeding and why the baby isn’t getting all they need at the breast.And so then not only are mothers coping with overcoming their difficulties, but they are also dealing with a sense of betrayal, isolation and lack of trust in those around who they thought were helping. It can be isolating to think “but I thought they were helping me” and feel let down by the people they put their trust in.5. And if she stops breastfeeding, let her grieveFor some, the hurdles and challenges are more than they can overcome, and they reach a point where they decide that they will stop breastfeeding. But we need to watch our language: she hasn’t ‘given up’; she hasn’t failed. It is never her fault for struggling or stopping.When mothers themselves talk about ‘giving up’, or when we use that language around her we enhance her sense of failure. Instead, she can own the decision. Just like in birth: when mothers feel in control they have a more positive birth experience whatever it might look like. She needs to be in control of the decision of when she will stop breastfeeding.And at the point of deciding to stop, especially if it has been an intense, stressful, scary, painful time mothers may feel relief. One mother said:“I was relieved and I knew it was the right decision. It was the right decision at that time – doesn’t mean it couldn’t have been different, but I’m at peace I made the right decision then. Yes, I regret it wasn’t different. But my memory of stopping is overwhelmingly one of relief.”And that’s the point. Each mother will feel differently, so it’s important that supporters don’t assume, or don’t placate. We just need to listen to what she wants to say about it. One mother who stopped breastfeeding, said about her family:“They won’t let me say I’m sad about it – every time I say something like that, they shut me down by telling me ‘I did well’, ‘she’ll be fine’. I know all that. But I want them to just let me be sad about it.”And then we often hear about GUILT: that the mother feels guilty for stopping. Or she feels guilty and wonders if maybe she didn’t try hard enough or guilty that maybe, just maybe she wonders if just doing this for herself. But guilt is so hard to deal with because no-one can fix it. But if we turn it around: and perhaps help the mother to see she is describing GRIEF, then perhaps she can start processing it. It’s a grief that breastfeeding isn’t as she has hoped for. A grief that her ideal of how she thought it would be for her and her baby isn’t the reality. It’s the grief that Petra Hoehfurtner explains as “the sense of loss and failure that goes much deeper than intellect or emotions.”But just as with any grief – mothers need to go through the process of dealing with that grief. One model proposes five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance as part of the framework of moving on. And that can take time. Some may skip or revisit different stages as part of the process. But often the instinct of those around is to want to stop her grieving, and to get her to a place of contentment with her decision. But no-one can do that for someone else – it’s grief and that’s a personal process that has its own timing.A last word to the mother who knows the struggleIn LLLGB, we often meet or talk with mothers who have gone to amazing lengths to make it work. Some are still breastfeeding, some are combination-feeding and some are no longer breastfeeding. Many have had brilliant supporters, partners, fathers, co-parents by their sides: after all it takes a team to parent a baby[4].But whatever the outcome, each of them has shown an incredible determination and strength to meet their babies’ needs. It’s not your fault. Be proud of your successes.And for those of you, who are in the middle of a struggle to make breastfeeding work right now: you are doing an amazing job. Keep asking for support from those who can help you. Celebrate your successes. Hang on in there. We hope you reach your goals – whatever they might be – and that you find a pride and peace in your achievements.Written by Justine Fieth, LLL Cambridge, 2018Further readingLLL Links:Find a LLLGB  support groupSupporting a Breastfeeding MotherDealing with criticismFinding the right supportFinding my peopleMothers on … support from our nearest and dearest1.https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/supporting-breastfeeding-make-it-happen/2.

Successfully breastfeeding your premature baby,https://laleche.org.uk/successfully-breastfeeding-premature-baby/,"You may be reading this because you have a preterm baby, or because you are expecting to deliver your baby before full term and you want to be prepared. Perhaps you’re supporting someone who has recently had a preterm baby. Whatever your situation then we hope this information will help to get breastfeeding off to a successful start.Before your baby arrivesYour premature newbornEstablishing breastfeedingLooking after your own health and wellbeingTaking your breastfed baby homeBefore your baby arrivesIf you know your baby will be arriving soon, you may wish to try antenatal expression of colostrum. This is where you hand express some of the thick, creamy first milk into a sterile container such as a syringe. This can be given to your baby immediately after birth reducing the possibility of them needing to have early formula feeds. Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can cause serious long term health problems if left untreated, and preterm babies are at higher risk of low blood sugar than babies born at term. Having some colostrum ready means that this is available instead of formula (or donor milk if available).If you are at risk of early labour and taking precautions to avoid it, then consult with your healthcare professionals about your individual case before starting antenatal expression as it may be considered to increase your risk of going into labour.You can read more about antenatal expressionhere.If there is time before your baby arrives, someone from the paediatric team on the neonatal unit where your baby will be cared for should come and talk to you about how you plan to feed your baby. You can supply them with any expressed colostrum you have in a labelled container, and discuss how you wish your baby to be fed while you are establishing your milk supply.Some neonatal units will have access to donor breastmilk, and will be able to tell you if your baby will be eligible to receive this – as supply is limited, this is likely to be restricted to the babies who need it the most. They will discuss and get your consent if formula may need to be given while you are building your milk supply. This may also be the time to talk about how you want supplementary feeds to be given to your baby.Smaller or weaker babies will be given a nasogastric tube, to allow milk (your own, donor or formula) to be fed down the tube. Bigger and stronger babies may be given bottles. You may wish to discuss paced bottle feeding (the art of giving bottle feeds in a way that supports breastfeeding) or cup feeding.If you wish to express breastmilk for your baby, then your hospital should be able to provide you with a breastpump – asking for this before your baby is born means that you have it ready as early as possible. In the early days you need to be stimulating milk production in your breasts between eight and twelve times in twenty four hours, including at least once at night – this might be by your baby feeding effectively at the breast, or pumping sessions.To read more about successfully expressing breastmilk, clickhere.Your premature newbornWhen you baby arrives there is likely to be a sudden rush of activity as your baby is checked and stabilised. They may be rushed off to the neonatal unit leaving you feeling stranded in the delivery unit. Be kind to yourself. You may feel that starting to express milk is a practical way that you can be involved in their care even when you are apart from each other.There is evidence to show that if you start expressing within the first hour after birth it can have a long term positive effect on your milk supply.Establishing breastfeedingYou may be expressing on your ward (if you are still an inpatient) or on the neonatal unit. Many mothers find that being close to their babies while they are expressing can help to increase the amount that they are able to express. If you are separated, looking at photos of your baby can help or smelling something that has been close them.If you are expressing on the unit, you may wish to be close to your baby as you do so. Some mothers use screens for privacy. You can ask for these to be provided. You don’t have to use screens if you prefer not to – using scarves or nothing at all is a completely acceptable choice. Do what you feel comfortable with and helps your milk to flow easily. Listening to music may help you to relax and increase your milk production.You are the person most known and familiar to your baby. Being with you is the safest and most secure they can possibly feel. If your baby is very fragile they may not be able to come out of their incubator at first. Ask the staff how you can be involved in their care and to show you how to hold and comfort them through the vents in the incubator. Once your baby is able to come out of the incubator, thenkangaroo carecan become an important part of your time together. This is where your baby is placed skin to skin on your chest for as long as possible and a blanket put over both of you. Your baby is able to enjoy the sensations of your closeness and the deep relaxation and comfort they feel helps them to regulate their breathing, temperature and other health indicators. It also helps your breast to become a familiar environment and allows them to practise feeding directly from the breast easily.It used to be thought that babies under a certain gestation didn’t have the ability to suck and swallow, or that directly breastfeeding was tiring to them. Happily, more recent studies have disproved these concerns. Once babies are well enough to breathe unaided (off ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure – CPAP), they can be brought to the breast. Smaller and younger babies will still need to have some of their milk given to them via tube feeds, but this allows you and your baby to learn to breastfeed together without a feeling of pressure.Smaller babies have smaller mouths and lower muscle tone. This may mean you need extra support to get breastfeeding established. Seek skilled help early and often. Keep asking until you findsomeone who is able to support you effectively.Premature babies often find it easier to feed in laid back breastfeeding positions. This is where you are supported in a reclined position with your baby tummy down on top of you. This helps gravity to ‘stick’ your baby to you and stops them slipping off. If you need to sit in a more upright position, then supporting the whole length of your baby’s body close to yours with a hand behind their shoulders means they don’t have to support their weight and stops them from curling in on themselves. Read more about laid back breastfeedinghere.You may find that your baby quickly falls asleep when breastfeeding. This isn’t a sign that you are exhausting them, but that they are small and being soothed. You can help them to stay awake for longer by washing their face with cool water, gently blowing on them or tickling their feet. You may find that breast compressions – gently smoothing down your breast towards the nipple – helps your baby to stay alert and interested in feeding as this makes the milk flow more quickly and easily for them.All new babies need to feed frequently – and premature babies are no different. The volume of milk that their stomachs can take at each feed is very small, and breastmilk is easily digested. It is normal for babies to feed between 8-12 times in a 24 hour period, including at least once at night.Neonatal unit staff need to be able to ensure that all the babies in their care are receiving the right amount of milk for them to grow. Premature or sick babies may be less able to communicate their need for milk. These two things combined mean that units often use feeding schedules, with feeds timetabled every two, three, or even four hours.When you agree how often your baby is to be offered supplemental feeds (any milk not directly from the breast) it may be helpful to remember that four hourly is less frequently than you would expect a healthy, full term newborn to feed. You may also choose to consider these as ‘backup’ feeds – any time spent feeding directly from the breast doesn’t reset the clock, but is bonus extra calories. Keep writing down how often you are breastfeeding in your baby’s notes, as this may help you and the staff to feel confident about the transition from scheduled, measured feeds, to baby led, responsive feeding.One of the things the unit staff will look for in a baby coming close to going home is that your baby is able to rouse themselves to feed. If your baby is waking for feeds more often than their feeding ‘schedule’ (and you are spotting signs of effective feeding), this may be a sign that they are becoming better able to manage their own need for milk. You will probably need to keep offering more frequently than they ask for milk – this is true for many babies. Remember, you can’t feed too often, and your baby can always say no if they don’t want milk right now!Breastmilk is an incredibly responsive food, made specially for each baby. The milk that you are making for your premature baby will be even more densely nutritious than the milk of a full term mother. Every drop of milk that you can supply for your baby is like medicine – strengthening and building their immune system and providing the calories they need to grow. Some mothers feel that providing milk for their babies is a unique way that they can care for their babies. It can be an important part of bonding with a new and fragile baby. While your baby will continue to benefit from your milk for as long as you provide it, you aren’t tied to expressing for longer than you want to do so. If you decide it’s time to stop, then gradually reducing your pumping sessions will slow and stop your milk production without causing problems for you.Looking after your own heath and wellbeingYou will be recovering from pregnancy and birth, and may be experiencing additional health problems. It is important to remember to look after yourself – the more smoothly your recovery goes, the more strength and energy you will have to become more and more involved in your baby’s care. If you have older children at home, you may be struggling to balance meeting their needs with being present with your newborn. Many mothers have to leave hospital long before their baby is ready to come home and have to travel back and forwards to be with their baby. This is a time to say yes to as many offers of help as you possibly can. If someone can provide a lift, deliver a meal, entertain an older child or do a load of washing – or just sit with you to talk things over in the hospital cafe – these may make life a little easier for you and help you to keep going at a difficult time.You may be taking medications yourself and be concerned about them passing through your milk. Discuss your concerns with your and your baby’s medical teams. They may be able to reassure you or find suitable alternatives. For specialist information about whether a drug is compatible with breastfeeding, you can contact your local LLL Leader who has access to resources and professional support.It may feel impossibly painful to keep leaving your baby. Remember that by looking after yourself – eating, sleeping and taking the medication you need to get well – you are making sure that you carry on being able to be there to look after your baby.Taking your breastfed baby homeSeparately to any health issues your baby may be facing, your neonatal unit will want to know that you are able to make sure your baby is getting enough milk to continue growing. Being aware of your baby’s early hunger cues is important so that you can feed responsively and before baby gets too upset. You may have a very sleepy baby who still needs your help to wake themselves up to feed beyond their due date. Setting an alarm for the middle of the night can help you to make sure they don’t go for longer than a four hour stretch without feeding at night.Read more about recognising early hunger cues and about waking a sleepy babyhere.Read more about how to tell if your baby is getting enough milkhere.Many breastfeeding mothers and babies enjoy safe cosleeping. Premature babies are at greater risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or Sudden Unexplained Death in Infancy (SIDS/SUDI). While they will benefit from sleeping close to their mother, premature babies should sleep on a separate, firm surface such as a sidecar cot.It can be scary to make the transition from caring for your baby in hospital with a team of staff around you, to being at home. Your healthcare professionals are likely to make extra visits to support you and to keep an eye on your baby’s weight gain. You may find that being home together, able to stay together all the time, and in a comfortable environment, you rapidly get to know and understand your baby more easily and become more confident in your mothering skills.Photo credits: Olivia Brown and other mothersOther resourcesYou can read amother’s storyabout mothering her premature baby through special careThisvideolooks at breastfeeding in the first hour after birthThedrugs in breastmilk service, while not an LLL resource, gives quick access to information from a qualified pharmacistTheSmall Wondersfilms follow families through their experiences of having a baby on a neonatal unitGlobal Health Mediahave a series of videos about various aspects of life with a small baby"
Dealing with criticism,https://laleche.org.uk/dealing-with-criticism/,"Many new parents are surprised to find themselves feeling helpless when their baby first arrives. However well you prepare for your baby’s arrival, it is common to lack confidence or to worry that you don’t know what to do.There are thousands of books which will confidently tell you precisely what your baby needs; apps to keep track of whether you and your baby are doing the right things at the right times; healthcare professionals with charts and lists of milestones to tell you how your baby should be developing; family, friends and even strangers may be telling you how to take care of a baby and what you shouldn’t do.However well-meaning all this advice and support, it can often feel like you are being told that you’re wrong, told that you don’t know anything, or criticised for the choices that you are making. Sometimes as mothers we can feel criticised even when nothing is being said at all; the very fact that other people choose to parent in a different way can make us feel like they must think we are doing the wrong things.Responding to commentsTalking with friends and familyExpressing your opinions and feelingsDisagreements with healthcare professionalsHow to cope with feeling criticisedResponding to commentsIf someone else asks questions about the way you parent your child, or tells you that you should be doing something differently, you don’t necessarily need to discuss it in detail. For example, a neighbour might suggest giving your child a dummy when you have chosen not to, or a stranger in a shop might tell your toddler “you’re too heavy for your mummy to keep carrying you around like that!”. Particularly if the person is well-meaning, and perhaps someone who doesn’t have much involvement in your child’s life, it can be enough to have a few stock phrases to use. Here are some suggestions that parents have found helpful:“Thanks for your suggestion, I’ll think about it / maybe I’ll try to find out more about that.”“This is working for us right now, but we may decide to do things differently as time passes.”“You’re right, it’s difficult to get a baby to sleep / help a toddler to be more independent. How did you manage that with your children?”“We’re working on it! I’m sure things will be different / he’ll be out of nappies / he won’t still be breastfeeding by the time he leaves home!”“My midwife/health visitor/GP recommended that I do it like this, I’m just following instructions.”“I know it looks like hard work, but we’ve tried lots of ways and this is what we all enjoy most.”Or you can just smile, thank the person for their support, and change the subject to a less controversial one.Talking with friends and familyIf the criticism or disagreement comes from people close to you, it might not be as simple as moving the conversation on to an easier topic. You may well want the important people in your life to support and encourage you as a mother, and differences of opinion can really get in the way of that.If you think it would be helpful to discuss a disagreement in more detail, you could plan to bring it up at a time when you are relaxed and have enough time to do the conversation justice, and invite the other person or people to discuss it with you. For example, you could start with “I’ve been thinking about what you said the other day about me picking up my daughter when she cries. Would it be OK for us to talk some more about that? I’d like to understand what you think about it. Is this a good time?”Also think about what you want to get out of the discussion. You might be having this conversation with somebody like your partner or a grandparent who regularly takes care of your child and treats them in a way that is different from your own parenting style. In that case it could be important to you to persuade this person to change their opinion, or at least their behaviour, so that your child is not treated in a way that you find unacceptable.However, in many circumstances it is not necessary to try and persuade another person that you are right. Particularly if you are talking to someone who has treated their children in a very different way from you, trying to persuade them that they have made mistakes as a parent may not be constructive. It can be helpful to bear in mind that the person talking to you may have raised children many years ago, or in another country or culture, and the advice they were given about how to treat children could be very different. You may be able to find ways of acknowledging that they did their best with the information they had at the time, just as you are trying to do now.Expressing your opinions and feelingsOften, if you feel criticised or attacked, you just want an opportunity to express your point of view, or to defend your right to make your own choices about parenting. Even if the other person does not change their mind, it is common to feel better simply because you’ve been able to express yourself or defend your decisions. In this case, it can really help to start the conversation in a way that makes it clear you are not trying to start an argument, but would just like to express your thoughts.For example:“I know you and I have made very different decisions about discipline / weaning / etc. I’m sure you’re doing what works best for you and your family, just like I am.”“When you tell me that I’m spoiling my baby, I feel criticised and hurt.”“If there was one right way to look after a baby, all our lives would be a lot simpler, but I’m enjoying getting to know my baby and finding out what they need from me.”“Different approaches might work for different babies, and for different parents too.”Many of us find the day-to-day work and decision-making of mothering to be draining and difficult at times, and often we just want emotional support from those around us. When family and friends offer practical suggestions, they may be trying to acknowledge the demands of parenting and help you to cope, but it can feel like criticism. You can help loved ones to support you by describing the kind of support you feel you need:“I know that it’s hard for you to see me so tired, and I appreciate your offer to look after the baby so I can rest, but even though it’s tiring I do feel better having him with me. If you’d like to help, I’d love… [to come round to have lunch with you one day / some company in the evening when they’re fretful / someone to take my toddler to the playground so I can nap when my baby does]”“You’re right that I’m having some difficulties with breastfeeding, but it’s really important to me to make this work for me and my baby. I could really do with some encouragement to keep me going through the difficult days.”“When I tell you I’ve had a bad day, I know you want to come up with solutions to make life better for me. What helps me most is if you can listen and give me a hug, then I feel like I’ve got the strength to carry on.”“I’m working this out as I go, just like any parent, and doing the things that we find work best for us. Even though it must be strange to see me doing some things very differently from how you did them with your children, it means a lot to me to know that you want the best for us, and that you love us even when you disagree.”Disagreements with healthcare professionalsSometimes a healthcare professional may suggest approaches that you are not comfortable with, or may disagree with decisions you take as a parent. This could be anything from a health visitor suggesting early introduction of solids to a doctor prescribing a medical intervention that you do not want your child to have. Many parents find it hard to speak up when they are being given instructions by someone who has some kind of authority; it can help you to feel more confident if you prepare in advance, take someone with you for support, or put your concerns in writing if you find that easier.Here are some suggestions for how to approach difficult conversations with healthcare professionals:Ask for information: what are the expected benefits of the suggested action and how likely are they? What are the possible risks and how likely are they? What are the current evidence and best practice guidelines in this area? What alternatives are there? Is it possible to get a second opinion?Offer information: talk with your healthcare professional about any information you have and where it came from; look for respected sources of information such as medical journals and NHS guidelines. Give any background information that you think may be relevant (such as “my first baby was also on the 5thcentile for weight at this age”,  or “we have a family history of allergies and eczema”).Don’t be afraid to express your opinions and feelings. For example, “I understand that you believe this is in my daughter’s best interests, but it’s important for me as her mother to understand exactly what you’re recommending and why.”Remember that healthcare professionals have good intentions and want the best for the children they work with, even if you disagree with their views.Healthcare professionals have experience and training in their specialism; you have expertise and experience with your own child. Working together and using their medical knowledge and your understanding of your child can help everyone to find the best possible course of action.How to cope with feeling criticisedParenting can be tiring and difficult, and feeling criticised or unsupported by people around you can make it harder. It is important to take care of yourself, and to find ways to let off steam or wind down. It can be really good to have at least one supportive friend or relative who is willing to listen to you without judging or making suggestions, and to support you whether or not they agree with all the decisions you make. You may have other ways of dealing with stress – through exercise, creativity, relaxation; it can be hard to continue taking care of yourself in these ways once you have children to look after, but spending some time on your own wellbeing can really help you to be the kind of parent you hope to be.And don’t forget that you can contact other mothers through La Leche League, whether by speaking to a Leader on thehelpline, attending a meeting of your local group or joining them on social media. Our aim is to provide mother to mother support, by listening without judgement and providing a welcoming atmosphere, whatever your choices and experiences.Find your local grouphere.Written by Emma Taylor for LLLGB"

What’s in a nappy?,https://laleche.org.uk/whats-in-a-nappy/,"As new parents, we suddenly find ourselves examining our babies’ poo more closely than we could ever have imagined. We pay attention to the colour, quantity, texture and smell, and notice the slightest changes. We then go to the internet looking for answers and fear the worst. There are many versions of normal, and we will share some of these below.When your baby is born, your colostrum (first milk) has laxative and diuretic compounds in it to make your baby wee and poo. In the first few days your midwife and health visitor will ask how many wet and dirty nappies your baby has had, so you may find it helpful to take note of how many nappies you change.Your baby may not poo much at first but this will increase as your milk comes in. For an idea of how many poos to expect, seehttps://laleche.org.uk/is-my-baby-getting-enough-milk/#dirtynappiesIt can be tricky to tell if disposable nappies are wet – after five full days, when copious milk comes in, they should be heavy.Many disposable nappies have a faint line down the middle of the nappy which changes colour when wet.You can feel what a properly wet nappy should feel like by putting three tablespoons (45ml) of water onto a clean, dry one. Urine should be pale and mild smelling.This post onsigns of effective feedinghas more information.Pictures 1-9 below show the contents of one baby’s nappy in the first few days of their life, to give you an idea of what to expect from a healthy, full-term baby. If you have any concerns about your baby’s poo, or if you see blood in the nappy (beyond the first few days, when baby girls can have a mini period caused by birth hormones), don’t hesitate to contact your midwife, health visitor or GP.Picture 1Baby’s first bowel movement, called meconium, is tar-like, sticky and hard to remove.Picture 2Baby’s second bowel movement.Picture 3Poo from the first day of baby’s life. Reddish pink urate crystals are visible in this nappy; see picture 10 for more about urates.Picture 4Bowel movement on day two. Your baby’s poo will gradually change colour, from black to green to brown. It becomes a lot easier to wipe off as your baby begins to drink more milk.Picture 5Day three bowel movement. Looking a lot paler, heading towards a yellowish colour, and much less sticky.Picture 6Day four bowel movement.Picture 7Day five bowel movement.Picture 8Day six bowel movement.Picture 9Day ten bowel movement. By this age most fully breastfed babies’ poo will be this pale yellow colour. It is common for babies to have what are described as “explosive” poos, which may take you by surprise if your baby poos while you are changing their nappy!The following pictures show some ways in which your baby’s poo may look different from the typical pattern shown above.Picture 10In the first few days, you may see reddish pink crystals called urates in your baby’s nappy. They are often described as looking like brick dust. As your baby begins to take more milk, the urates should stop appearing in her nappy.Picture 11Sometimes your baby’s poo may be light green rather than yellow, and have small lumps in it like cottage cheese. This is common and not significant by itself, unless your baby has other symptoms that you are worried about.Picture 12This poo came from a three-week-old baby who was given Gaviscon because of reflux. When the medication was stopped, the baby went back to having runny yellow stools.Picture 13After the 12-week injections this baby had green poo, which went back to being yellow after a few days.Picture 14This dark green poo came from a baby who was later diagnosed with cow’s milk protein intolerance.Picture 15This poo, containing mucus, came from a baby diagnosed with allergies. Mucus in the poo is also common when a baby has a heavy cold, but this should be temporary and should stop when the baby is well again. If your baby’s nappy has persistent or unexplained mucus in it, seek medical advice.Picture 16As your baby starts to eat solid foods, you will see the results in his nappy. It is common for your baby’s very first foods to come out looking almost exactly as they did when they went in, as his digestive system is not used to dealing with these other foods yet. This is much easier to spot if your baby is eating finger foods rather than mashed food; the mashed foods are passing through semi-digested in the same way, but are less obvious in the nappy.With time, your baby’s poo will gradually change from yellow liquid to soft brown lumps, and you won’t generally see pieces of food. However, some foods are hard to digest and tend to pass through the body unchanged (even for older children or adults). This picture shows an 11-month-old’s nappy with partially digested grapes visible in it. Strongly coloured foods (like blackberries or beetroot) can also affect the appearance of your baby’s wee and poo.Written by Amanda Dunbar and Emma Taylor for LLLGB, 2017"
When You Don’t Enjoy Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/dont-enjoy-breastfeeding/,"After the work of getting things going, you may feel that breastfeeding should become easy and enjoyable. People talk about the amazing bond that comes with breastfeeding, or that wonderful oxytocin rush. There seems to be an increase in both classical art and stock photographs (no doubt very posed!) posted online showing glowing mothers nursing content babies.So what if you simply don’t enjoy it? What if you have a distracted and fussy baby? What if you feel self-conscious breastfeeding in public? What if your darling baby insists on pinching and nipping at every feed? Or quite simply, what if it just feels like a chore?Essentially, all of these feelings (and more) are very normal and it’s a rare mother who enjoys every single moment of her nursing journey, however long that may be. La Leche League is all about mothering through breastfeeding – not just the mechanics of getting a pain-free latch – and we are here to celebrate your successes and also support you when it’s a chore.It’s important to remember that breastfeeding is two way – it’s a relationship between you and your child. If there’s a part of it that isn’t working, it’s fine to change it.Society often isn’t overly understanding of breastfeeding, especially once a baby gets a little bit older. Getting support and realising your experiences are not unique is massively important. Many mothers have found that support via LLL – either face-to-face atmeetingsor via Facebook groups and forums. Realising you are not alone and that itwillpass are invaluable.Find Your Nearest GroupAs your baby heads towards toddlerhood, it’s absolutely fine to put limits on nursing and insist on ‘nursing manners’. Lots of mothers find ‘fiddle’ necklaces can help divert nipping fingers. Breastfeeding is about so much more than nutrition – it’s an emotional connection and a way of mothering. For a toddler who is mastering new skills and discovering the big wide world, this is invaluable. For the mother of an 18 month old with a child nursing more often than a newborn, it can be extremely trying. Setting limits, and self-care, as well as support and understanding from others, can help each mother find the balance that is right for them and ensure that nursing continues in a positive light for the dyad.Many mothers find they experience nursing aversion due to hormonal changes. Some mothers find they struggle around ovulation or during their period. For other mothers, a nursing aversion may be the first sign of pregnancy. Many mothers find nursing through pregnancy tough, and even painful. Some practical suggestions that mums find useful include limiting the duration of feeds (counting up to or down from 10, singing a nursery rhyme etc.) and using distraction to limit the number of feeds. Keeping well hydrated and well rested can help too.Some mums will find themselves feeding two children – a toddler (or older) and a newborn. Whilst there are many positives to tandem nursing, some mums will not want to feed both children at the same time, as they find this overwhelming. Again, this is perfectly fine – LLL is here to help you meet your own breastfeeding goals and find a balance that works for your family.Click here if you are Pregnant and Breastfeeding or Tandem Nursing.Depression or other negative emotions upon milk let-down (D-MER)Whilst not enjoying breastfeeding all the time, or developing nursing aversion is very common, a small number of women experience far stronger negative emotions when breastfeeding.This is called Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex, or D-MER. According toD-MER.org, “Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex is a condition affecting lactating women that is characterised by an abrupt dysphoria, or negative emotions, that occur just before milk release and continuing not more than a few minutes.” This is a physiological response (not a psychological response) that appears to be tied to a sudden decrease in the brain chemical dopamine immediately before milk let-down, and mothers may experience feelings of depression, anxiety, homesickness, agitation or anger, immediately before they feel milk let-down.This is rare, but extremely distressing for the mother. Please contact yourlocal LLL Leaderwho can support you if you suspect this is something you are dealing with.Following are some resources for more information:D-MER.orgis a website devoted to information about Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex.Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-MER)from the Australian Breastfeeding Association.Heise AM, Wiessinger D.Dysphoric milk ejection reflex: A case report.Int Breastfeed J. 2011 Jun 6;6(1):6.Cox S.A case of dysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER).Breastfeed Rev. 2010 Mar;18(1):16-8.What is D-MER?, from LLLI’s Breastfeeding TodayYou may also find the following on Breastfeeding aversion helpfulWhen Breastfeeding SucksZainab Yate 2020 available form the LLLGB BookshopBreastfeeding AversionNegative Feelings: D-MER and AversionWritten by Rae Lowe for LLLGB, 2017"
Breastfeeding and teething,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-and-teething/,"When it comes to teething, all babies are different: a very few are born with teeth already erupted through their gums, while others may reach their first birthday without any.  In general, most babies will have that first little flash of white in their gums by six months old, and by two years old she may well have sixteen teeth. In the six months after that, the final four big back teeth often called “two year molars” will probably emerge.Signs of teethingDealing with teething painHow teething may affect breastfeedingSigns of teethingMany parents find that teething symptoms are worst in the period before a tooth actually emerges, while it is working its way up through the baby’s gum. Some of the signs that parents report include:Changes in the way a baby latches on to the breast: feeding your baby may start to be uncomfortable, or she may change the position of her mouth or head, or her latch may just feel a bit differentDribbling: your baby is suddenly drooling all the time, and you may find yourself needing to change her bib or top several times a dayRedness and rash: your baby’s cheeks may be flushed bright red, and she may have a red rash around her mouth and chinLoose stools: your baby’s poo may seem runnier than usual, it may seem to irritate her skin more than usual if she isn’t changed immediately, and she may develop nappy rashBiting and chewing: you might notice that your baby is chewing her fingers or fist; all young babies put objects into their mouths as a way of exploring them, but you may feel that your baby is chewing his toys with more determination than usualNight waking: any pain or discomfort can disrupt your baby’s usual sleep patternSlightly raised temperature: some parents have said that their babies run a low-level fever at the point when a new tooth actually comes through the gum, warmer than usual but not hot enough to cause serious concern.Warning! Some of the symptoms listed above can also be signs of illness. If your baby has diarrhoea or a fever, or you are worried about his health, please seek medical advice.Dealing with teething painSpecially designed teething toys can give your baby some relief from the discomfort in his gums. Look out for toys with plenty of surface texture, or little bumps or projections to chew on. Some teething rings are filled with water and can be kept in the fridge or freezer until they are needed. You don’t have to use specially designed toys, though: many babies enjoy chewing a flannel that has been run under a cold tap and then wrung out, especially if it has been kept in the fridge to cool down. You can also try massaging the sore spot on your baby’s gums with your finger, if he seems to enjoy it. A baby who is cutting teeth further back in the mouth might like to have a toothbrush or similarly-shaped toy to chew on; you can buy a “first toothbrush” without bristles if you are concerned about your baby chewing them off.If your baby is eating solids, you can give him hard foods to chew on, like fingers of apple or carrot. Be aware that once your baby has actually cut a tooth, even the tip of it can be sharp enough to break a chunk off something like a raw carrot, so supervise him carefully and use your judgement about appropriate foods to offer. You could try freezing foods, such as fingers of banana, or freeze plain unsweetened yogurt into lollies (either use small lolly moulds, or place small spoonfuls onto a tray in the freezer with a lolly stick or baby’s spoon in each one).Don’t forget that breastfeeding can be really soothing for a baby who is unhappy or in pain. Occasionally a well-meaning person might advise a breastfeeding mother that a baby should be weaned from the breast when his first tooth comes through, but this simply isn’t necessary. The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding for at least the first two years of a baby’s life; mothers around the world have happily breastfed their babies through teething, and even up to the age when the permanent teeth emerge.How teething may affect breastfeedingLatch:Sore or swollen gums, or the presence of new teeth at the front of your baby’s mouth, may affect the way that she latches on to breastfeed. You may find it helpful to experiment with different feeding positions to find one that is comfortable for both of you. This is also a good time to keep an eye on your baby’s latch: make sure he is opening his mouth wide to latch on, ideally with his tongue visible above his lower teeth, and that he islatching deeply onto your breast.  If sore gums are interfering with feeding, try some of the tips above for addressing the pain immediately before feeding. Be careful about using anything frozen, or any purchased teething remedy that numbs your baby’s mouth, immediately before feeding, as the numbness can affect his ability to latch correctly.Biting:Sometimes a baby who has been dealing with teething pain by biting anything he can get hold of may experiment with doing the same thing to his mother’s breast. For some ideas on how to respond to biting, seethis page.  It is important to bear in mind that when a baby is correctly latched on to breastfeed, her tongue covers her lower teeth, so it should be impossible for her to bite you while actively feeding without biting her own tongue. A newly-emerged tooth is very sharp, in order to help it cut through the gum, so you may get a scratch from it during feeding. If your nipple is sore because of a bite or scratch, try using a different feeding position next time so that your baby’s teeth don’t touch the sore spot, and treat between feeds with pure lanolin or a hydrogel pad if necessary.Frequency of feeding:You may already have discovered that breastfeeding can be a brilliant way of soothing your baby if she is unhappy, or in pain: after vaccinations or during illness, for example. If your baby is suffering with teething pain, she may ask to feed more often, possibly for quite short periods each time. If you are happy to feed her as often as she wants, then it can really help both of you to get through this tricky time. But if your baby’s teething is making it uncomfortable to feed her, you may not feel like offering the breast every time she asks for it. You can use the suggestions above to address problems with latching and biting, and you can experiment with other ways of distracting her from the pain. Mothers over the years have tried many things, and common tricks include carrying your baby, taking her for a walk outside, dancing with her, singing to her, giving her a warm bath, and anything else that you have found that works for her.Dealing with dribble:It seems to be common for a teething baby’s dribble to irritate his skin. Make sure you keep him dry and clean, by gently washing or wiping his chin. You may want to do this immediately before offering him the breast, so that his dribble doesn’t irritate your skin too.Written by Emma Taylor for LLLGB, 2017"
Signs of effective feeding in the early days,https://laleche.org.uk/signs-effective-feeding-early-days-2/,"Most babies are keen to feed in the first 90 minutes after they are born especially if they are in skin-to-skin contact with their mum.If your baby is too sleepy to take this first feed or needs medical attention, it’s a good idea to ask your healthcare team to show you how to hand express and give the colostrum by teaspoon or syringe. He may sleep for a few hours after this first feed – feel free to cuddle him and wake him if you want to feed. He may feed four to five more times in the first 24 hours.After that first 24 hours we know that babies who are getting adequate amounts of milk will wake to feedat least eight  times over a 24-hour period (10 to 12 times being more likely)so it is valuable to keep an eye on numbers and offer feeds even if the baby does not seem to be actively asking.Babies need to feed frequently; this encourages your milk to increase in volume. Once your milk is coming in, after about 48 hours or so, you may hear your baby swallowing. You may also notice that your breasts feel fuller and that after your baby has fed they soften a little.Babies who areexcessively sleepy, reluctant to wake or who only wake briefly and suckle for very short times will need some extra milk, and your colostrum is best. Learn how tohand expressand give your expressed colostrum frequently, until your baby is waking, keen to latch and is doing active sucking and swallowing, with pauses.Your baby will be content and satisfied after most feeds and will come off the breast on his own. A period of cluster feeding each day (or night) is common. When a baby is cluster feeding he may be very keen to breastfeed a lot and not want to settle to sleep for three or four hours.However, if you feel he is never really satisfied after feeds, trust your instincts: some expressed milk might help. Seek help withpositioning and attachmentso that your baby can learn to extract milk efficiently himself.You can get support from LLLhere.These videos may help with positioning and attachment:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjt-Ashodw8https://vimeo.com/11692547There are more videos along with images and descriptions in our post:Positioning & AttachmentKeeping an eye on his nappies can help you know if he is getting enough milkPoosAt first poo is sticky, black, and almost tar like. This will become greenish, less sticky, and wipe off your baby’s skin easier! By day three/four you will notice the poo change colour to mustard yellow, and it will be soft and seedy.Two or more of these poos every 24 hours are a sign your baby is getting enough milk in the early days. After three full days (72 hours) your baby should produce at least three poos per day.By five to six weeks your baby will develop his own pattern and may go days without a poo. Providing he is gaining weight ok, poos are no longer as important for being confident he is getting enough milk.WeesAt first your baby may not pass much urine but this increases each day. If you have had extra fluids during labour and birth your baby may produce extra urine for the first 24 hours or so. By day two look for two wet nappies over 24 hours, days three and four look for three or more wet nappies each 24 hours. By the time your baby is five days old, wet nappies should be more frequent, usually six or more over  24 hours.If your baby’s urine output is less than this or you see red/orange specks in your baby’s nappy, (these are called urates) your baby could do with some more milk.It can be tricky to tell if disposable nappies are wet – after five full days, when copious milk comes in, they should be heavy.Many disposable nappies have a faint line down the middle of the nappy which changes colour when wet.If you are worried your baby isn’t getting enough milk, considerhand expressingyour milk. You can feed the expressed milk by teaspoon, cup or directly into his mouth. With some extra milk your baby will generally start to wake more and feed more actively.If you are concerned that your baby isn’t well contact your midwife or GP.There is more information in these posts:Is my baby getting enough milk?My baby needs more milkBreastfeeding concernsOccasionally there is reason to be concerned about a baby’s weight gain or the way he is breastfeeding. Here are some signs that your baby may not be getting enough milk at the breast:If your baby has not regained his birth weight by two weeks of ageIf baby is passing less urine and pooing less frequently than described above, or his poos remain dark, then seek additional support and give more milk.

Help! My baby bit me!,https://laleche.org.uk/help-baby-bit/,"It’s not unusual for a baby to test out his new teeth on his mother. Some will breastfeed for months or years without even a tiny nip, some may do it once or twice, while some babies are more persistent biters.He isn’t trying to hurt you – he isn’t yet able to understand that he is causing you pain.Some mothers have even been advised by other people that “you’ll have to stop breastfeeding now he’s got teeth”, which is absolutely not the case. The World Health Organisation recommends two years or more of breastfeeding, so there’s no hurry to stop just because your baby has teeth; we do call them ‘milk teeth’, after all! (Seehttps://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-beyond-a-year/for more information)However, the pain of being bitten, or the fear of being bitten again, can really get in the way of a comfortable breastfeeding relationship with your baby, so it’s important to find some ways of dealing with the biting so that you and your baby can continue to feed in comfort.Why did she bite me?It’s hard to know exactly why a baby bites for the first time, as she can’t tell us what’s going on, but there are a number of situations where mothers often notice biting.Baby is teethingSometimes a baby who is cutting a new tooth will bite on anything he can get hold of to ease the pain in his jaws and gums, and unfortunately that includes his mother’s breast or nipple. Most mothers notice that biting is most likely while the tooth is on its way through, rather than after it has erupted through the gum, though a brand new tooth can be very sharp so may leave a scratch even if your baby doesn’t clamp down with it. Read our post onteething.Baby has a cold or a blocked up noseWhen your baby has a stuffy nose, it can be really hard for her to get an effective latch on the breast and breathe comfortably while feeding. In her attempts to latch on, or in frustration at not being able to latch, she may bite down.Baby wants mother’s attentionWhen you have a young baby, breastfeeding can be a rare opportunity to turn your attention to something else, like texting a friend, reading a book or shopping on the internet. A tiny baby doesn’t seem to notice much if your attention is elsewhere (though she enjoys it a lot when you look at her and talk to her), but a baby of a few months or older may discover that a quick bite is a very effective way of getting your attention away from your phone or book: suddenly you’re looking at her and talking to her, even if you do have an angry expression on your face!Baby is distracted while feedingYou may be feeding your baby in a noisy environment, possibly with an older sibling doing something interesting in the background. For the first few months, a baby at the breast seems oblivious to everything else, but as he gets older he starts to take an interest in what’s going on around him as he feeds. He may decide to turn and look at whatever has caught his attention, but may keep tight hold of your nipple while he does so. Ouch!Baby is experimenting with cause and effectAs soon has your baby is able to control her arms and legs, you will notice her trying to reach for objects and interact with the world; an older child will spend what seems like hours building a tower and knocking it down, or banging two objects together to hear the sound they make. Life is just one big experiment, and this is how babies and children learn about the world they live in. Unfortunately for you, this includes using his mouth and teeth to find out about the taste and texture of objects, including your breast; and if you yelp or jump, your baby will probably want to know whether you will react in the same interesting way if he does the same thing again. And again, and again…Milk flow has slowed downWhen your baby first latches on to your breast, the milk usually flows quite quickly. As the feed goes on, he has some to work a little harder to get the thicker, creamier milk from your breast. Sometimes a hungry baby might use all kinds of tricks to try and speed up the milk flowing, such as bobbing his head against your breast, wriggling, fiddling with the other breast, or, yes, biting.Baby is not in a sustainable positionA baby who feels like she isn’t being held securely while she’s feeding, or who is having to bend her neck to reach your breast, may try and grip your breast with her mouth to keep her in position. As your baby’s body grows longer, the positions that were comfortable for feeding a newborn might not work any more, although the change is so gradual that you might not notice until feeding becomes uncomfortable. Have a look athttps://laleche.org.uk/comfortable-breastfeeding/.Baby has been using a bottle, dummy or sippy cupIf your baby has any drinks from a bottle or a cup with a spout, or if he uses a dummy, he may have discovered the pleasure of biting the teat or spout, either to deal with teething pain or just to see what it feels like. It can be hard for him to understand that it’s fine for him to bite his bottle or cup, but not to bite your breast when he’s feeding.Baby is premature or has low muscle toneMost of this advice is focused on a baby who has been feeding well but starts biting at a few months of age. However, a baby who is premature or who is born with overactive muscle tone (hypertonia) may reflexively “clamp down” with his jaws whenever anything touches the inside of his mouth. If this is the case for your baby, try waiting for him to open his mouth wide and extend his tongue before you latch him on, so that your breast touches his tongue rather than his lower gums. You can ask for medical advice from your healthcare professional, and breastfeeding support and information from La Leche League.Find LLL supporthere.What should I do if it happens?When a baby bites, a mother’s automatic reaction is often to shout, and to pull the baby off the breast. This is understandable when you are startled by the pain of an unexpected bite, but it’s not the most effective way of responding. A loud or sudden yell can frighten some babies enough to put them off breastfeeding entirely, and pulling the baby off the breast while his jaw is still clamped onto it can be more painful than the original bite.If your baby bites, respond immediately and firmly. Say “no!” or say her name sharply. If she hasn’t already let go, although you might feel the urge to push her away, instead try pulling her closer to you. As your breast covers her nose she will automatically open her mouth to be able to breathe. If this doesn’t work, you can try slipping your finger between her jaws to open her mouth.Try offering her another chance to latch on properly and feed, if she seems to want more milk. If she has bitten before, or if you feel angry with her for biting you, it may be best to put her down entirely, take a break if you need one, then offer her more milk when she asks for it and when you feel ready. If you think she is getting frustrated by a slow milk flow, try offering the other breast. You could also try offering an alternative, such as a teething ring or a cup of water.How can I stop it from happening?At the beginning of a feed, make sure you and your baby are in a comfortable position for feeding and that he can reach your breast comfortably. Encourage him to open his mouth wide and make sure that he latches on correctly (seehttps://laleche.org.uk/positioning-attachment/).When your baby is latched on properly and feeding well, make sure he gets plenty of loving attention: make eye contact, stroke his hair, hold his hand. When it’s possible, feeding in a quiet environment might help him to stay focused on feeding. Although this isn’t always possible, try to minimise distractions as much as possible. Many mothers find their babies are less likely to bite when they are sleepy.When your baby is latched on and feeding effectively, his tongue should be between his lower teeth and your breast.This means he cannot bite while he is feeding without biting his own tongue. If your baby has been biting, pay attention to him while he feeds. You may notice that he doesn’t seem to be actively feeding any more, or you may feel him moving his tongue out of the way, unlatching from your breast or shifting the position of his head.These are warning signs that he may bite, so if you notice this, you might like to unlatch him by slipping your finger into the corner of his mouth and gently removing him from the breast.If he wants more milk you can allow him to feed again from the same breast or the other side, paying close attention to getting a good position and latch.If you think your baby is biting because of teething pain,try allowing him to chew on teething toys, or if he is eating solids try freezing a peeled banana, or using plain unsweetened yogurt to make ice lollies. Your baby may enjoy chewing a damp flannel that has been kept in the fridge, or he may let you massage his gums with your finger to ease the pain. Be careful about using ice, or any teething medication that has a numbing effect, immediately before breastfeeding, as it could make it hard for your baby to latch on properly. Continuing to breastfeed while your baby is teething can really help him to manage the pain, as feeding can be very soothing for him.If you think your baby might be getting frustrated by a low milk supply,seehttps://laleche.org.uk/my-baby-needs-more-milk/It is common to go through a brief spell where your baby feeds more than usual; breastfeeding works by supply and demand, so allowing your baby to feed more often will encourage your body to produce more milk to meet his changing needs.If your nipple or breast is sore because you have been bitten,you could try applying some lanolin or expressed breast milk to the sore area.
