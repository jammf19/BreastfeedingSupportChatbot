When Breastfeeding Ends Suddenly,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-ends-suddenly/,"Usually it’s possible to end breastfeeding gradually. However, a mother may find herself in a situation where she needs to stop breastfeeding straight away, for example to start treatment for a serious medical condition such as cancer, or, sadly, if her baby has died.Sudden weaningStopping breastfeeding suddenly can lead to potential problems— weaning gradually allows time both for milk production to reduce and stop, and for a baby to adjust to other ways of feeding and comfort.It’s normal to feel overwhelmed and under pressure if it’s been suggested that you stop breastfeeding without delay. Enforced weaning is not easy on either mother or child, but you may have more options than you think.In the ﬁrst yearIn the first year, even if your baby has started eating solid foods, milk will remain his main source of nutrition and energy. Unmodified cows milk is unsuitable as a main drink for babies under a year old. For guidance on preparing infant formula see the NHS leaflet Guide to bottle feeding:http://www.unicef.org.uk/BabyFriendly/Resources/Resources-for-parents/Department-of-Health-bottle-feeding-leafletWhether you choose to use a bottle, an open cup or a spouted beaker when replacing breastfeeds will depend on your individual circumstances. Introduce bottles only if your baby seems to need the comfort of sucking from one. An older baby or toddler may prefer to drink from an open cup anyway.Photo courtesy of Kimberly Seals AllersWeaning an older baby or toddlerThe following ideas may be useful if you need to wean quickly.• Change your daily routines so your child is less likely to ask to nurse.• Offer drinks and snacks before you expect your child to want to nurse.• Do what you can to keep your child happy—whether by using lots of distractions or by keeping things calm.• See tips in our postThinking of Weaning.Is weaning really necessary?Mothers may be told they need to wean their baby from the breast for a variety of reasons. Before starting to wean, it’s worth double-checking that the test, medication or other treatment you need really does mean you shouldn’t breastfeed. While any situation or drug needs to be checked individually, many medications are compatible with breastfeeding. If a medication is incompatible with breastfeeding, an alternative may be available that is compatible. So it may be possible to continue breastfeeding after all. More information on this can be found inWhen a Breastfeeding Mother is Unwelland an LLL Leader can help locate information on speciﬁc medications.When a short-term test, or a medication or other treatment is incompatible with breastfeeding, temporary weaning is always an option. You can maintain your milk production by expressing your milk and then discarding it. Once the test or treatment is completed you can return to breastfeeding as before—an LLL Leader can share information on getting your baby back to the breast and increasing your milk if necessary.Find local LLL supporthere.How quickly do you need to wean?If you have a few weeks, cutting out one daily feed no more often than every two or three days allows your milkproduction to decrease slowly with little or no fullness and discomfort. The rate at which feeds can be dropped without discomfort varies from mother to mother.If you need to stop nursing your baby immediately, you can use an automatic or semi-automatic electric breast pump or hand expression to relieve discomfort while you decrease your milk production. This will mean the hormonal changes are more gradual. If you haven’t expressed your milk before, you may need a little practice.Breastfeeding is more than just a method of feeding. It’s also a familiar source of closeness and comfort, so your baby will need lots of extra love and attention when you stop nursing. If you are coping with illness this may not be easy—practical support from others will be a big help.Looking after yourselfBreastfeeding can make life easier if you are coping with illness. If you have to stop breastfeeding quickly, you’ll need to devote lots of time and energy to your baby to keep him happy while he copes with the changes.Look after yourself by:• Reducing unnecessary outside commitments and limiting housework to essentials.• Enlisting the help of your partner and any older children with housework and entertaining your little one.• Using any outside help you can.• Resting whenever possible, including lying down with your baby or toddler to sleep in the day.• Having a quiet time, with quiet activities in a safe room. You may be able to rest, even if you can’t sleep.• Getting to bed a little earlier to have a longer period of uninterrupted sleep.Slow Milk Production GraduallyIf you suddenly stop nursing your baby, your body continues to produce milk. A good way of slowing milk production gradually is to pump or hand express just enough milk at regular intervals to avoid discomfort. In this way milk production will slowly decrease. Keeping a little milk ﬂowing prevents your breasts becoming overly full and engorged, which could lead to a blocked duct, mastitis or even a breast abscess. It also makes it more comfortable to hold, carry and cuddle your baby if you need to distract him from nursing.Express milk by hand, with a pump or both until your breasts feel comfortable and the milk ﬂow slows. The younger your baby is, the more care you will need to take to reduce your milk slowly and gradually. Aim to produce a comfortable fullness in your breasts by expressing less often than your baby was nursing. This fullness will then help slow your milk production. If your baby was breastfeeding about every two hours, you could try expressing milk every three hours or so at ﬁrst to relieve excessive fullness. You might need to express at night too to start with.As well as cutting out a whole expressing session every two or three days, you can also reduce the time at each session. Expressing less milk each time will also help limit how much milk you produce.Shorten sessions by a minute every few days, for example, but watch out for signs of engorgement due to insufﬁcient removal of milk.If your breasts become ﬁrm, hard, shiny or lumpy, take action without delay to relieve this.Hand express or gently pump enough milk to make your breasts comfortable. Make sure you drain milk from each part of the breast.Keeping comfortable• Applying warmth for a few minutes, or having a comfortably hot shower or bath can make it easier to express milk as the warm water may help you relax and stimulate your let-down.• Ice packs can provide relief from swelling. Use an ice pack large enough to cover most of the breast, wrapped in a lightweight towel to protect your skin. Leave it in place for 15-20 minutes. Crushed ice in a plastic bag or a bag of frozen vegetables can be used (the latter can be thawed and refrozen several times, before discarding).• Breast pads can help with leaking. You may be more comfortable wearing a ﬁrm bra for support—possibly a size larger than usual. But note that any consistent pressure on the breast can cause a blocked duct, or mastitis.• Drink according to your thirst. Since salt causes the body to retain ﬂuids, it may be helpful to restrict your salt intake until any feelings of fullness are gone.• Pain and swelling can be relieved by a suitable over-the-counter anti-inﬂammatory medication from your pharmacist.Symptoms of mastitisIf one area of your breast appears to be inﬂamed—tender, red and hot—and if you have a fever over 38.4°C or ﬂu-like symptoms, you may have mastitis or a breast infection. Continue to express milk focusing particularly on softening the inﬂamed area. If it does not improve contact your doctor who may prescribe an antibiotic.More information on dealing with mastitisWhen you have stopped nursing or expressingOnce you have stopped breastfeeding or expressing milk and the feelings of fullness have gone, your breasts will continue to produce small amounts of milk for some time. Some mothers ﬁnd their breasts start to feel full and uncomfortable a few days or more after they’ve stopped feeding, or expressing. Treating this fullness by expressing small amounts of milk every so often will help prevent it getting worse.It’s not unusual to be able to express drops of milk months or even years after weaning, although producing signiﬁcant amounts long afterwards could suggest a hormonal imbalance and is worth checking with your doctor.Sometimes the sudden hormonal changes following an abrupt end to breastfeeding may bring on or worsen depression. Do talk to your GP or health visitor if depression intensiﬁes or lasts more than two weeks, as effective treatments are available.FeelingsHaving no choice about ending breastfeeding may leave you and your child feeling frustrated, angry or sad, especially if your child still very much enjoys nursing. Neither of you want to wean but it’s the only option. It might help to say to your child something like, “It’s hard for you, I know. You’d really like to feed. I’d like to be able to feed you, too. But we have to stop now and I’m sorry. I still love you.”Many people think nursing doesn’t matter once a baby can eat solid foods and that stopping breastfeeding is easy. They may ﬁnd it hard to understand the distress you feel. Seek out support from those who do understand how hard it is. You can ﬁnd this support from anLLL Leaderor from mothers in your localLLL Group.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of LLLGBFurther ReadingHow Weaning Happens. Bengson, D.

Allergies & Food Intolerances,https://laleche.org.uk/allergies/,"Babies can be unsettled for many reasons and it can sometimes take time and effort to work out the cause. Our pageThe Unhappy Breastfed Babycan help you determine whether your baby’s behaviour is due to something other than an allergy.But when you have ruled out most of the obvious causes and your baby is still, unhappy, colicky, experiencing dry and itchy skin or passing mucousy stools you may wonder whether they could be reacting to something in their diet or environment, or something in your own diet.Certain medical conditions can have symptoms similar to those of an allergic reaction. It may be wise to rule these out before deciding whether a baby’s symptoms are due to an allergy or food intolerance.A baby’s immune system is immature at birth.Colostrum, or early milk, is rich in antibodies, particularly secretory IgA (SIgA), which provide a protective coating inside a baby’s intestines1. Mature breastmilk continues to provide protection, helping to prevent potential allergens from reaching a baby’s blood.Exclusive breastfeeding generally helps to protect against allergy but it may still occur.If any immediate family member ( siblings or parents) has an allergy eczema, hay fever or asthma, it makes it more likely that the baby could develop allergies2.Food intoleranceA food intolerance does not involve an allergic reaction but can cause similar symptoms. It occurs when a baby has difficulty digesting a particular food. You may not need to stop giving your baby a food to which he is intolerant—reducing the amount may be enough.Food allergyA food allergy occurs when a baby has an immune response to specific foods. There are two types of food allergy reactions; immediate and delayed. A baby can have either or both3.Immediate reactions are also called IgE-mediated alllergies. This is because the baby’s immune system creates specific IgE antibodies to a certain food. If a baby is given the specific food they are allergic to, the IgE antibodies will recognise it and cause the rapid release of chemicals, including histamine, that trigger inflammation and allergic symptoms. Symptoms appear within minutes, or up to 2 hours after eating the food responsible3.Delayed reactions are called non-IgE mediated allergies because they are not controlled by IgE. Instead it is believed such reactions are regulated by immune cells. Symptoms appear 4-72 hours after eating the food3.It is wise to see your GP or health visitor if your baby is showing signs of allergy, but some symptoms are more worrying than others.Seek immediate medical help if your baby has signs of an anaphylactic reaction: sudden onset of breathing difficulties, swelling, or collapse, with or without a rash, after physical contact or eating a particular food.Allergy symptomsFood allergy symptoms occur in several different body systems; the tummy, airways and skin. An Allergic baby will usually have symptoms in more than one body system, but need not experience all the symptoms to indicate allergy. Many of the following allergy symptoms can also occur in normally developing children for other reasons.IgE mediated symptoms3Non-IgE mediated symptoms3TimeImmediate: within minutes or up to 2 hoursDelayed:within 4–72 hoursWhen nursingBaby hungry for the breast but pulls away after a minute or two, arching the back and screaming*SkinItchingInflammation**Hives/nettle rashSwelling, usually around the lips, face and eyesItchingInflammation**Eczema (dermatitis)TummyItchy mouthNauseaColicky tummy pain***VomitingDiarrhoeaRefluxLoose or frequent poosBlood or mucus in pooTummy painInfantile colic***Food refusal or aversionConstipationInflammation in the nappy area**AirwaysCough, chest tightness, wheeze, noisy breathing, trouble breathingItchy nose, sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, conjunctivitisCough, chest tightness, wheeze, noisy breathing, trouble breathingOtherAnaphylaxis: sudden onset of breathing difficulties, swelling, or collapse with or without a rashReduced growth, along with oneor more tummy symptoms aboveLethargy*This may also be caused by a fast let-down. See Too Much Milk and Oversupply formore information if you think that this may apply to you.**Inflammation appears red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin.***Colic is defined as repeated episodes of excessive and inconsolable crying in an infant thatotherwise appears to be healthy and thriving.Environmental triggersAn irritant is something that causes damage to the skin. Eczema (also known as dermatitis) and dry skin rashes can be caused by mild irritants such as bubble bath, baby wipes, skin cream, fabric conditioner or laundry detergent4. Many mothers find avoiding unnecessary products or using a different product improves things. Reading packaging can help avoid problems with common irritants such as lanolin and perfumes. Use fragrance-free products whenever possible. Be aware that herbals can also be allergenic and irritant – being natural does not necessarily mean a product is any less irritating. Hay fever symptoms and other ear, nose and throat symptoms can be caused by spring and summer pollens and other airborne allergens such as dust.Identifying the problem foodIf your baby is having only your milkFood allergens in the mother’s diet can pass through into the breastmilk so a breastfed baby can have an allergic response or intolerance to something in the mother’s diet.Consider:Are you taking any laxatives, medicines, vitamins, iron tablets or other supplements?Do you drink lots of caffeinated drinks? Coffee, cola, tea and some pain relievers, cold remedies, weight control aids and diuretics contain caffeine. Chocolate contains a substance called theobromine that can have a similar effect to caffeine if you eat a lot.Have you recently eaten a new food or any particular food in large amounts?Are there any foods that you don’t like but have decided to eat during pregnancy or breastfeeding because you think they will be good for you and your baby?Are there foods that you crave? What foods do you snack on when you have a bad day?Depending on how sensitive your baby is, removing or cutting down on the offending items in your diet may well solve the problem.If your baby is also having infant formula or solidsThe majority of babies don’t need anything other than mother’s milk before about six months — no infant formula, drinks or solids. Babies who have started solids can be sensitive to certain common foods until they are a little older.Consider:Could your baby be reacting to the drinks or solid foods he is having?Is he on any medication or vitamin supplements?Could he be receiving other drinks such as infant formula or juice, or solid food, from anyone else without your knowledge?Infant formula or follow-on formula is usually cow’s milk-based and a common, avoidable cause of allergy. Babies do not need follow-on formula at all.Removing the offending food from your baby’s diet for now should solve the problem; they may be able to tolerate it in a few months time. If you think your baby may be reacting to a prescribed medication that they have to take, speak to your doctor, who may be able to prescribe an alternative.Common problem foods5Common problem foods which may be eaten by a baby or a breastfeeding mother include:Milk and other dairy products such as butter, yoghurt, cheese, whey, casein, caseinate, lactoseEggPeanutSoyWheatFishSesame seeds (in tahini and hummus)Lupin/lentils (including chickpeas which are in hummus)Shellfish; crustaceans (e.g. crab, lobster, crayfish, shrimp, prawn), molluscs (e.g. mussels, oysters, squid)Fenugreek is closely related to peanutsTree nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, etc.)Celery and celeriacMustardCommon foods that can be involved in intolerance or irritation but not usually allergy:Sulphur dioxide and sulphites, benzoates, glutamate, salicylates, dietary aminesCitrus fruits, strawberries, tomatoesCertain additives, artificial colourings, flavourings and preservativesThese can turn up in the most unexpected places so do check everything consumed including drinks and medicines. For example, some juice drinks contain milk, and wine can contain milk, egg or sulphites.Cutting out suspected foodsIf your baby is exclusively breastfed, you may need to follow an elimination – reintroduction diet. It can help to keep a food and symptom diary.When eliminating major food groups take care to ensure you continue to eat a healthy and balanced diet. Your GP may be able to refer you to a dietician if you wish.Only cut out one food at a time and allow 2–4 weeks to see if your baby’s symptoms improve. If there is no improvement in this time, then the food is unlikely to be the culprit and can be reintroduced3. Consider cutting out a different food.If symptoms do improve, reintroduce the food slowly to confirm the food allergy. However, if your baby has previously experienced a severe or immediate reaction, ask your GP for specialist support before reintroducing the food.Note: Usually a cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) predicts an allergy to other animal milks (e.g. goat or sheep milk), and in some cases soya. If you plan to cut out dairy you may wish to cut out other animal milks and soya at the same time, then reintroduce them each individually.Seek immediate medical help if your baby has shown anaphylactic signs, such as a rapidly developing rash, breathing difficulties, or swelling.A note on eczemaElimination – reintroduction diets should not be done due to the presence of eczema alone.Some children who have a food allergy do have eczema, but most children who have eczema do not have a food allergy. If the only symptom is eczema it is unlikely to be caused by a food allergy. It is worth noting that frequently eating a particular food may mean a baby learns to tolerate it. If the food is stopped, for example during an elimination diet, there is a risk that tolerance may stop and an IgE mediated allergy (including possible anaphylaxis) can form. If you think your baby’s eczema is due to a food allergy it is best to speak with your GP about allergy testing or to get referred to an allergy specialist6.Introducing solid foodsHuman milk contains tiny traces of whatever foods a mother herself has been eating. This is the ideal way to prepare a baby gently for the eventual introduction of solids. The best foods for your baby are usually healthy foods selected from your diet. Solids can be introduced when your baby can sit up (with or without support) and starts reaching out for the food on your plate. For more information, seeStarting Solid Food.If your baby is under the care of a paediatrician for allergies, talk to your specialist team about how to introduce specific allergenic foods.Body tolerance levels can changeBeing allergic or intolerant to something means that your body is sensitised to it, but the symptoms you display may vary in each particular instance; sometimes you may not display any symptoms. Your body’s allergen tolerance level changes based on many factors including stress and your general health, so its ability to react to immune threats also varies. If your immune system is affected by more stressors than usual, you may show symptoms of an allergy/intolerance more readily.Seek supportIt can be quite an effort to be an allergy detective with a fussy baby on your hands, so seek information and support. The good news is that small changes to your diet could make a big difference to a baby with a food allergy or intolerance.An LLL Leader can help you determine the most likely cause of your baby’s symptoms.Local LLL groupsare great for practical and moral support and you may find others there who have had similar experiences. Your GP or health visitor can help diagnose food allergy and refer you to specialist services for testing and advice.Did you know?If a baby reacts when their mother drinks milk or has dairy products, this is a sensitivity to cow’s milk protein, not lactose intolerance.Most infant formulas contain cow’s milk, often referred to as whey based or casein based.Soya, the basis of some infant formulas, is also a common allergen.Infant formula may contain fish oils and vegetable oils (e.g. palm, rapeseed, coconut, sunflower).Medicines and supplements can contain other ingredients that are potentially allergenic.If you or a member of your immediate family has an allergy or intolerance, your baby is more likely to have one too1.FAQsQ. Do I have to give up breastfeeding if my baby is allergic to something in my milk?A. No; eliminating the offending food from your diet will remove the allergen from your breast milk enabling you to continue breastfeeding if you wish to. See sectionCutting out suspected food.Q. Will my baby outgrow his food allergy?A. Possibly; some children do, some do not. Children are most likely to grow out of cows’ milk, egg and soy allergies.Q. I thought I was not meant to feed my baby egg/peanut/etc. until they were over 1 year old?A. This was old advice. Recent research shows introducing allergenic foods from around 6 months old may help the baby to learn to tolerate the food. Introducing the food later can make it more likely that the baby will develop an allergy to the food.Q. What’s the difference between cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) and lactose intolerance?A. True lactose intolerance (reduced capacity to digest lactose) is very rare in babies and is diagnosed within days of birth. Temporary lactose intolerance or lactose overload (too much lactose for the baby to digest) can cause tummy symptoms similar to an allergy. Lactose is produced in the breast, regardless of the mother’s diet. Seek support if you suspect your baby has symptoms of lactose overload. CMPA is an immune reaction and can cause symptoms in many body systems. Breastfeeding mothers of children with CMPA generally need to exclude all cow’s milk protein from their diet – including milk, cheese, yogurt etc. See sectionCutting out suspected food.Q. Should I avoid eating a food my baby is allergic to if I become pregnant again?A. No; as long as you are not allergic to it and it is not one the foods you usually need to avoid in pregnancy (such as undercooked meat) eating a particular food in pregnancy has no effect on the development of allergy.Q. Is my baby allergic to a food because I ate it whilst pregnant?A. No; eating a particular food in pregnancy has no effect on the development of allergy.Q. If I have another baby will it develop allergies too?A. Possibly; if you have a sibling with allergies you are more likely to be genetically predisposed to develop allergies. However, having an older sibling decreases the risk of developing allergy.Written by Sue Cardus, Robyn Halliday and mothers of La Leche League Great BritainEndnotesAndreas, N., Kampmann, B., Le-Doare, K.

Thrush and Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/thrush/,"There are many causes of nipple and breast pain. Nipple thrush is one possible cause, although it is often wrongly or over-diagnosed before other possibilities have been investigated. A skilled breastfeeding supporter can help you rule out other possible causes before a thrush diagnosis is made.What is thrush?Thrush is a yeast infection, usually caused by the fungusCandida albicans. Thrush likes warm, dark and moist environments, and it might grow on your nipple.Candida albicansis naturally present in our bodies and usually it causes us no harm; however, certain things can create an imbalance in the body and cause an overgrowth. These include:Previous nipple damage.If you have thrush affecting any other part of your body, or if another family member has a thrush infection.If you or your baby have been treated with antibiotics or corticosteroids.If you take the contraceptive pill.Bottle or dummy use, especially in the early weeks after birth.Anaemia or diabetes.Exhaustion and stress.Diagnosing thrushThrush is diagnosed by symptoms and/or by looking at mother and baby. Sometimes culture samples are taken. This is known as swabbing.There are different views about swabbing. Some breastfeeding organisations recommend swabbing to confirm thrush1. However, some studies say that swabbing is neither reliable nor accurate, as Candida can be part of the normal healthy skin surface. Although theCandidaspecies can be easily singled out in the laboratory when present in milk, there is a lack of consistent rules for milk sample, collection, storage and analysis globally.2Swabbing is more complex than just ‘taking a test’. It does not always give a clear thrush diagnosis, or confirm if the pain is due to thrush or a bacterial infection. The roles of bacteria and yeast in relation to nipple and breast pain during breastfeeding remain unclear. It is also possible to have bothStaph.andCandidaon the nipples without any symptoms.Thrush symptomsThere can be many causes of ‘thrush-like’ symptoms. Nipple and breast pain is likely to be caused by something OTHER THAN thrush if:Breastfeeding has always been painful.Your nipples are flattened, wedge-shaped or appear white after feeds.Your baby has no symptoms.Signs of thrush in the nursing parent may include:A burning feeling in the nipples, especially after every feed.Itchy nipples that may be sensitive to touch.Flaking and/or shiny skin on the nipple or areola. Nipple skin and areola may be red on lighter skin and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin. This can be more difficult to see on darker skin tones.White patches/tiny blisters on the nipple or areola.A loss of colour in the nipple or areola.A nipple wound which is not healing despite appropriate management.Nipple pain which:Gets worse during feeds and may continue after a feed.Begins suddenly after a period of pain-free breastfeeding.Happens on both sides.According to research, thrush is more likely to be a cause of painful nursing if the following symptoms occur together:Shiny nipple/areola with stabbing painFlaky nipple/areola and mammary pain.3Pain may be felt deep in the breast; however, deep shooting pain between feeds, previously said to be a secondary infection in the milk ducts, is more likely to have a different cause.4Signs of thrush in the baby include:White patches on the cheeks, tongue, roof of mouth or gums. When wiped off they may look red or bleed.Nappy rash.Fussing during and between feeds due to pain.A white coating on the tongue alone is not a sign of thrush as most nursing babies have a white, milky coating on their tongue (sometimes this may be as a result of poor tongue function). Nappy rash and fussiness may also have other causes.Not Thrush? Alternative causesOther conditions that can result in ‘thrush-like’ symptoms may include:Bacterial infectionBacterial and thrush infections of the nipple can have similar symptoms, such as burning pain and soreness.Staphylococcus aureus (Staph.)is the most common bacteria associated with breast infection. With a bacterial infection of the nipple there may be:Yellow pus in the damaged area.Yellow scabs or crusty areas on the nipple.5It is possible for you to have both thrush and a bacterial infection.Shallow latchWhen the latch is shallow, the nipple is squashed, causing pain on the nipple and sometimes deeper within the breast. This may damage the nipple and increase the possibility of a bacterial infection. Even when thrush is the cause of sore nipples, a deeper latch can make it less painful.You can read more aboutPositioning and Attachment here.Skin conditionsSkin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis, can affect the nipple area.  Some people may also have sensitivities to nipple balms containing lanolin.  If you have a history of skin allergies or a similar problem elsewhere on your body, discuss this with your GP. A dermatology referral is sometimes necessary.You can read more aboutcauses of nipple painhere.Subacute MastitisMastitis is inflammation of the breast. This may or may not be caused by a bacterial infection.Often, the general term ‘mastitis’ is used to mean one type of breast inflammation. However, it may help to think of mastitis as being on a spectrum, with blocked ducts at one end and abscess at the other.Different types of bacteria may be involved in breast inflammation. Some of these do not cause fever or flu-like symptoms, but you may still experience painful breastfeeding, needle-like burning pain and engorgement. Some researchers have suggested the term ‘subacute mastitis’ to describe inflammation of the breast without fever or flu-like symptoms. These researchers believe that the term ‘mammary candidiasis’ (thrush) should be avoided and replaced by ‘subacute mastitis’.6,7You can read more aboutmastitis and treatment of mastitis here.VasospasmVasospasm is a sudden narrowing of the blood vessels. The main cause of nipple vasospasm is a shallow latch. When the nipple is squashed it may turn white or change shape. As blood flows back to the nipple, it causes pain on the nipple and deeper in the breast. Deep breast pain is sometimes called ‘Mammary Constriction Syndrome’. Tension and positioning may add to deep breast or muscle pain.Vasospasm is also connected with the circulatory condition Raynaud’s Phenomenon. A history of Raynaud’s may increase the likelihood of it happening during breastfeeding. Symptoms may happen in response to cold and separately from breastfeeding.For more information seeFurther Reading.Thrush treatmentsWhen thrush is diagnosed, it is recommended that both mother and baby are treated at the same time, even if one is symptom free, as they may pass a thrush infection back and forth between them.Breastfeeding should continue if thrush is diagnosed.Medications for the nursing parent:The most effective treatment for topical thrush is Miconazole (Daktarin) cream (2%), which should be applied to the nipple in small amounts after every feed. In mild cases, expect improvement within a couple of days. In more severe cases, it may take 3 to 5 days or longer. Sometimes, symptoms get worse before they get better.8If nipples are very inflamed, a mild steroid cream (hydrocortisone 1%) can be used to facilitate healing.If symptoms do not improve, oral fluconazole may be required in addition to the above. A higher initial dose of 150-400mg is prescribed, followed by 100-200mg daily for at least 10 days. It may take a week or longer for the pain to disappear.9Mothers may also be prescribed nystatin (Nystan) cream or ointment, or clotrimazole (Canestan) cream. However, both are considered to be less effective than other options and clotrimazole is associated with allergic reactions.10Thrush can spread to other family members. Therefore, it may be necessary to treat partners and, if breastfeeding more than one child, the sibling.Comfort optionsRinse nipples with clean water and let them air dry after each feeding.Place something cold on your nipples before nursing. If cold or air drying increases the pain, it may be related to nipple vasospasm (see above).Take mild over-the-counter pain medication.In the short term, express milk and offer it to your baby by another means if feeding is too painful.Medications for the baby:Miconazole (Daktarin) oral gel four times a day after feeds. Manufacturers recommend that this is not used in babies under 4 months due to risk of choking. Healthcare providers must ensure that the parent/carer is aware of how to apply the gel safely if prescribed under this age.11Nystatin (Nystatin) oral suspension may be prescribed, but this is considered less effective than miconazole gel.Neither miconazole gel or nystatin suspension should be applied to the mother’s nipples.Non-medical treatment options:Practical, self-help measures you can take to combat thrush alongside medication include:Frequent hand washing, particularly after nappy changes or using the toilet.Having a separate towel for each person in the family, or at least for you and your baby.Keeping nipples dry. Avoid breast pads, if possible, or throw away/change frequently.Wearing 100% cotton bras and underwear.Washing towels/clothing at 50 °C or above. A hot iron can also kill yeasts.Washing and sterilising dummies, nipple shields, teats and toys frequently.Replacing toothbrushes, toiletries and cosmetics.Reducing sugar, yeast, dairy products and artificial sweeteners.Rinsing nipples with vinegar in water or baking soda in water after every feed.Switching to a non-antibacterial hand soap.Taking herbal supplements and vitamins, such as grapefruit seed extract, garlic, B vitamins and zinc.Anecdotally, some mothers find it helpful to take a probiotic, such as lactobacillus acidophilus.If there is no improvement following prescription medications and self-care measures, then it may be worth considering if the original diagnosis of thrush is correct.Expressing milkPreviously, parents were advised to avoid expressing and storing milk during a thrush infection to avoid possible re-infection, as freezing does not kill yeast. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that this will happen.If you are worried about using expressed/stored milk during a yeast infection, you can either use it while you and your baby are being treated for thrush, or you can warm the milk to 63 °C for 30 minutes to kill bacteria and yeast, before cooling and offering.Current/ongoing researchResearch has been carried out on both breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding, non-pregnant women in order to learn more about yeast infections of the nipple and reliable ways of confirming this.There are different views about the presence of nipple thrush and how accurately it is diagnosed. One study suggests that the evidence supporting a link between nipple/breast pain and thrush is “non-scientific” and largely anecdotal, without the support of a proper microbiological analysis.12Others believe that since thrush does not grow on normal skin, damage of the nipple and areola as a result of a shallow latch is the real problem and that, unless this is dealt with, nipple thrush will remain difficult to treat.13In summaryCandida albicansis naturally present in our bodies and finding an overgrowth can be difficult. Furthermore, the relationship between and the role of fungus and bacteria in relation to nipple/breast pain is unclear.More research is needed to understand how common nipple thrush is and to find reliable ways of confirming this.Further LLLGB readingBlocked Ducts & MastitisComfortable BreastfeedingNipple Pain – Why and What to do?Positioning & AttachmentThe Unhappy Breastfed BabyReferences1.The Breastfeeding Network Drugs in Breastmilk Information.

What’s The Big Deal With Skin-To-Skin?,https://laleche.org.uk/whats-big-deal-skin-skin/,"Lynsey Hansford looks at some of the amazing benefits of skin-to-skin in the hours and days after birth.Skin-to-skin has become a birth plan buzzword. The term has penetrated ‘birthspeak’ and, in my view, is at risk of being treated as a trend that is only paid lip service in the immediate postpartum period. I did just this with my first child! I knew skin-to-skin was something I *should* be doing but didn’t really know why or what it should look like.I mention skin-to-skin a lot in my voluntary work supporting mothers, the evidence shows it is something of a panacea for mother-baby pairs. I wonder if it is sometimes overlooked as a suggestion because it is such a simple idea; putting your bare skin to your baby’s bare skin is not difficult, radical or revolutionary.Looking at the research on skin to skin is important in understanding its value and how we can make it work for us. It’s absolutely not just for mothers having a natural, vaginal birth, it doesn’t need to be discarded from your birth plan if labour doesn’t progress as you’d hoped and it doesn’t need to be forgotten after the first hours of your baby’s life. It is a valuable mothering tool and at the very least, it can do no harm. Below is a small sample of the research on skin-to-skin, I have included links at the bottom of this post that will lead you to many more.So here comes the science…Research showed that skin-to-skin contact, early suckling, or both, in the two hour period following birth had a positive affect on the mother-baby relationship when the baby reached 1 year old, when compared with mother-baby pairs who had been separated. NHS care in the UK should now reflect the importance of keeping mama and baby together after birth. Also consider that this study showed that swaddling reduced the mother’s responsiveness to her baby.(1. Bystrova K et al., 2009)A Polish study showed that skin-to-skin contact for longer than 20 minutes after birth increased the duration of exclusive breastfeeding.(2. Mikiel-Kostyra et al., 2002)You may have heard of the ‘gentle caesarean’ where some skin-to-skin time can still be enjoyed by the mother-baby pair, in contrast to traditional caesarean procedures. A study has shown that the complications rates in 144 ‘gentle caesareans’ were similiar to or lower than those for traditional caesarean births. Not directly related to the value of skin-to-skin but helpful for mothers who have a c-section to be aware that this is not necessarily a reason to forego the known benefits of skin-to-skin contact. If you are in a position to do so, agree this with your caregivers beforehand.(3. Magee S. R. et al., 2014)We shouldn’t forget the value of skin-to-skin with dad where it isn’t possible with mum. A small 2007 study showed babies cried less and calmed quicker on spending skin-to-skin time with dad whilst mum was in recovery post c-section, compared to babies kept in a bassinet for this time. My personal opinion is that the results would be the same with any loving, caring, warm-bodied adult for eg. mother’s partner who is not the baby’s father, grandparent, other relative or friend.(4. Erlandsson K et al., 2007)A Swedish study looked at slightly older babies (1-16 weeks) with severe problems latching on to the breast. It investigated if skin-to-skin contact could positively affect the baby’s ability to latch, compared to a group where the baby was clothed. The skin-to-skin babies were more able to latch correctly and successfully suckle at the breast and their mothers felt more positive and experienced less pain. I love that this shows us how something as simple as closeness and bare skin cuddles with our baby can help get the nursing relationship back on the right track and that even severe latch problems are fixable.(5. Svensson KE et al., 2013)So now you know how awesome skin-to-skin can be…but it is only an option, maybe skin-to-skin doesn’t feel right for you? I believe that the process of labouring, birthing and feeding your baby is a robust one, we are meant to survive. Somewhere in between all the research, information and options there is something for you and your family.I also talk often aboutBiological Nurturing, aka laid-back breastfeeding. Suzanne Colson studied the positions in which the innate breastfeeding behaviours of the mother-baby pair worked best. There is a lot of information on her website about how you can make her findings work for you. In her book,An Introduction to Biological Nurturing: New Angles on Breastfeeding (2010), she acknowledges that not all mothers will feel comfortable with skin-to-skin and states that these positions can be effectively used when clothed.When birth doesn’t go to plan, do what you can, when you can. This is no time for guilt, sometimes circumstances get in the way of our best-laid plans. I will repeat, I believe the process of labouring, birthing and feeding your baby is a robust one and can survive a veer off course. Start skin-to-skin as soon as you and your baby can manage, some medications might affect you and your baby’s innate behaviours. Be patient, have faith and seek skilled help for your particular situation early.I wish I’d known all of this during my first pregnancy, my last baby is growing up fast and I am making the most of every bare skin cuddle opportunity. Based on a very small sample of one toddler, I can also tell you that 19 month olds crave skin-to-skin and may indicate this by taking their clothes off and climbing inside your jumper.

Thinking of Weaning?,https://laleche.org.uk/thinking-of-weaning/,"Weaning is the process whereby a child learns to take nourishment other than his mother’s milk. It starts when the child is introduced to foods and drinks in addition to breastmilk, and ends when he ﬁnally stops nursing.Introducing a baby to the exciting world of food alongside breastfeeding is covered inStarting Solid Food. Here we concentrate on situations when mothers plan to cut down or stop breastfeeding their babies or toddlers and we will be using the word ‘weaning’ to refer to this process. A baby is usually ready to start tasting solid foods at around six months old, but it’s often some time before he is ready to eat substantial amounts. Until then, milk remains his main source of nutrition and calories.Gradual weaningSince it is normal for babies to continue to breastfeed into the second year or beyond, the weaning period may last months or years. Ending breastfeeding abruptly can be physically and emotionally traumatic for both mother and baby and is best avoided when possible. Weaning gradually over a period of weeks or months allows breastfeeding to end in a comfortable way. Natural weaning, where mum and child end breastfeeding very gradually in a mutually acceptable way, is another option.Breastmilk continues to be a valuable source of nutrition and immunity for as long as nursing continues. Nursing toddlers have fewer illnesses and breastfeeding promotes proper mouth development. Your own risk of developing breast cancer is lowered the longer you breastfeed. Nursing is a valuable mothering tool and many mothers ﬁnd that it gives them and their toddlers immense comfort and closeness.The World Health Organisation recommends that breastfeeding should continue for up to two years of age and beyond, with appropriate complementary foods from six months. So alongside introducing solid foods and a cup from about six months you can continue to breastfeed avoiding any need to give bottles or infant formula.Partial weaningPartial weaning may be an option if you are feeling overwhelmed by your child’s need to breastfeed round the clock. Shortening the length of feeds or reducing their frequency may be enough to make you feel less overwhelmed. Some families ﬁnd weaning their little one from night-feeds relieves the pressure—other families encourage their child to feed less during the day whilst meeting his need to nurse at night. You may have become used to thinking that nursing meets your baby’s every need for attention. As a child grows he will crave your focused attention as well as your presence. Just joining in enthusiastically with his play may be enough to change the pattern.Natural weaningOne thing is certain: all children eventually stop breastfeeding. They grow and change dramatically in the ﬁrst few years of life, and their interest in nursing changes too. Children want to nurse only as long as it fulﬁls a need for them. A need that is satisﬁed goes away. Many mothers just continue to enjoy the closeness and connection of breastfeeding for as long as it is working well for them. Natural weaning allows their children to grow at their own pace, giving up breastfeeding according to their own timetable. This gradual process allows a mother’s milk to diminish slowly and comfortably.Returning to workBreastfeeding can continue if you are returning to work. Some mothers express milk while at work for their baby to have next day—others simply continue nursing while at home. If you decide to wean before you return to work, ﬁrst cut out those feeds that happen during working hours. If things don’t go to plan and your child is still nursing once or twice a day when you return to work, breastfeeds will then be at times when you are available. Continuing to enjoy the closeness of nursing can make the periods of separation easier for both of you. It also means your child still gets antibodies through your milk for protection from any infections caught at nursery or when with the childminder.Mixed feelingsIt seems no sooner have you started breastfeeding than people will ask when you intend to stop! Coping with pressure to wean from circumstances outside your control or from outsiders is noteasy. However you will know in your heart what feels right for both of you and the decision is yours alone. You can continue to breastfeed for as long as you are both happy and enjoying breastfeeds. Take weaning as slowly as you wish. All mothers and babies are different. Children mature at varying rates and will wean at different ages. There are no rules on when is the ‘right’ time to ﬁnish breastfeeding— aim to ﬁnish when both you and your child feel good about it.PregnancyPregnant nursing mothers sometimes receive conﬂicting advice about whether to wean. Some continue to breastfeed during pregnancy and may go on to feed both children. This is called tandem nursing. Others wean or ﬁnd their child weans naturally during the pregnancy. The booklet Breastfeeding Through Pregnancy and Beyond or the bookAdventures in Tandem Nursing(2nd edition available through theLLLGB shop). may help when considering your options. Some mothers ﬁnd that shortening feeds or partial weaning helps them meet both their needs and those of their older baby or toddler.Love and attentionWeaning will not remove your child’s need for you or necessarily make you less tired. Nor will weaning from night feeds guarantee that your child will sleep from dusk till dawn. Older babies andtoddlers still wake for a number of reasons—hunger, thirst, discomfort, pain, bad dreams or teething. Your child will need your attention and care for years yet. Providing other kinds of attention can sometimes be more tiring than simply nursing! Ending breastfeeding before your baby or toddler is ready to stop involves effort on your part. You’ll need to offer substitutes and distractions in the form of food and attention. Substituting lots of this ‘other-mothering’ can help your child come through the weaning process with his conﬁdence and trust in you intact. If you are tired or overwhelmed, taking things slowly may be easier for both of youOlder babies and toddlersYou are in the best position to know what sorts of attention will be the most acceptable substitute for nursing for your child. It can take a little trial and error to work out the best options for your child and some may work better than others at different times of the day.Don’t offer, don’t refuseis a simple technique to help when weaning from the breast.Change daily routinesso your child is not reminded about nursing—avoid sitting in your usual nursing chair; get up promptly for breakfast; introduce a bed-time routine that includes a sleepcue, such as a music CD or story which can continue when breastfeeding has stopped.Enlist your partner’s help or that of another adultin giving your child breakfast or settling him to sleep.Offer a snackjust before you expect your child to nurse, so as to increase the length of time between feeds and/or shorten a feed. Sit together and have a drink and a snack yourself. This can emphasise the pleasure of sharing food and is a way of giving attention to compensate for the closeness of breastfeeding.Suggest an interesting activityto distract a child from nursing: visit the park or a friend; cook together; involve him in helping you with your work. Give your child your full attention and save phone calls, emails and your own activities for later.Stay at home and keep things calmto help a child who asks to nurse when he is overwhelmed.Postponementcan be an effective weaning method for helping wean older children who can cope with waiting, but note that it can make some children all the more determined to nurse.Shorter feedsmay work for older children and can be combined with substitution and distraction. You could follow a short nursing with a snack and drink. Some mothers count or sing a nursery rhyme to limit the length of a feed.Bottles or cupsWhether you choose to use a bottle, an open cup or a spouted beaker to replace breastfeeds will depend on your individual circumstances. Introduce bottles only if your baby seems to need thecomfort of sucking from one. An older baby or toddler may like to drink from an open cup so that bottles are unnecessary. Unmodiﬁed cows’ milk is unsuitable as a main drink for babies under a year old so if you decide to stop breastfeeding before 12 months ask your health visitor what to give instead of breastmilk. A baby tends to drink larger amounts at each feed from a bottle than from the breast so he may need fewer bottles per day than his usual number of breastfeeds. He’ll miss the close contact and comfort that nursing provides so double up on cuddling and carrying to make up for it.How quickly?Building plenty of time into your weaning strategy will allow you to try different approaches and decide what works best for you both. It will enable you to slow down the pace if your baby is ill or teething, or when life is hectic. For your own comfort the younger your baby the slower you may need to wean.If you are actively working towards stopping breastfeeding, cut out one feed per day, no more often than every two or three days. This will allow your milk production to decrease slowly avoiding uncomfortable fullness and reducing your risk of becoming engorged or developing mastitis.If your breasts feel uncomfortably full or painful, take action to relieve engorgement—it’s easiest to just breastfeed. Even a short feed or hand expressing a small amount of milk can make a difference. SeeEngorged Breasts—avoiding and treatingfor more suggestions. By keeping the process ﬂexible and taking things at a steady pace you’ll stay comfortable and your child can gradually become accustomed to substitutes for breastfeeding, for comfort sucking and at sleep-times.Naptime and sleepNaptime and bedtimebreastfeeds are often the last to go and can seem the hardest to end, because they are often a cue for sleep. Some mothers continue with these, even when daytime weaning is complete. La Leche League does not advocate sleep-training techniques in which babies or children are left to cry for long periods. These methods for training young babies to fall asleep alone can be distressing for all involved and may be psychologically damaging. A well-attached child likes to know someone who loves him is close by when he goes to sleep. Develop a simple bedtime routine so your little one knows what to expect. At ﬁrst it can include nursing—later you can substitute other sleep cues such as a back rub, songs, stories and kisses. Children love bedtime ritual and it helps to keep the routine consistent by using the same sequence of cues whenever you settle your young child to sleep—day and night. Adults, too, like bedtime routines!Ideas for night weaning• A bedtime story and cuddle with a drink and snack can replace the closeness of breastfeeding.• Once your child is sleepy, he may be able to fall asleep with a cuddle, or while you are gently patting or stroking his back. This way you can help him learn to fall asleep without your nipple in hismouth. You may need to be gently persistent.• Cuddles in another pair of loving arms can replace nursing at night, if you have another supportive adult available.• Offer a drink and possibly a midnight snack if he wakes and seems thirsty or hungry. Leave a drink and a snack ready for early risers.• Delaying or shortening feeds in the night works for some families. If you ﬁnd your child is insistent on nursing why not just nurse him brieﬂy—until he settles? Or offer other comforting until a certain time, say 3 am, then breastfeed as needed after that to ensure that everyone gets some rest.• An older toddler may be able to make an agreement with you not to ask to nurse until it is light outside.Babies and toddlers often go back to sleep more easily if they receive attention before they are fully awake. Sleeping close by your toddler may make night waking less of an issue as you can lie down and rest while he settles. Alternatively, some families ﬁnd their little ones are reminded less of nursing if mum and the breast aren’t too easily available.Time and patienceSometimes new habits are very quickly established, at other times this takes longer, but being aware of your child’s feelings and meeting his needs should help weaning go smoothly and pleasantly for you both. Going at your child’s pace helps prevent this becoming a battle.Take a breakIf weaning isn’t going well—perhaps because your baby isn’t developmentally ready, or because he is teething or unwell—you may ﬁnd that having a break from it for a few days, or even a week or so makes a difference. Taking this time to recharge gives you more energy to continue. A week can make a lot of difference to a baby’s development and weaning may subsequently become easier. Babies and children need more emotional security at times of developmental change. Stepping back like this takes courage, but it can give you time to consider how to end breastfeeding in a way which suits you both. What may initially seem impossible could soon alter dramatically because babies constantly grow and change. The longer you can allow for your child to adjust to weaning, the easier it will be for him.Looking after yourselfIf you can, reduce unnecessary outside commitments and limit activity to essentials if you are trying to stop breastfeeding. You can then give your child the focused attention he will need and also have time to rest or sleep during the day. A break or rest can be just as important for you as your baby grows as when he was a newborn— particularly if he is very active.Could you…• Lie down with your baby to sleep in the day? Sometimes extra closeness helps with weaning.• Use outside help if there is someone your toddler feels comfortable spending time with?• Arrange a quiet time, with quiet activities in a safe room? You may be able to cuddle while you rest, even if you cannot sleep. Even when an older child no longer sleeps during the day, maintaining the ritual of a ‘quiet time’ after lunch or a rest for both of you helps pace the day.• Go for a walk with your child in the buggy, or for a drive in the car? If he is lulled by the movement and the view, you then have time to recharge your mental batteries.• Get to bed a little earlier so as to have a longer period of uninterrupted sleep?When a child isn’t ready to weanIt isn’t easy when you are ready to stop and your baby is not. Breastfeeding can easily become a struggle and you can end up feeling frustrated and resentful. A baby’s fussiness or demands for attention usually increase, at least temporarily, when a major change such as weaning takes place. Your child’s behaviour will let you know if weaning is moving too quickly. Increased tantrums, crying, regressive behaviours, anxiety, thumb sucking, increased night waking, new fears of separation and clinginess are possible signs that weaning is moving too fast for your child. If your child is so desperate to nurse that you can’t distract or comfort him, slow down or change your weaning tactics to ones that suit him better, or perhaps wait a while before trying again. Children over two years old may be more ﬂexible and open to negotiation about their need to nurse so weaning may often be accomplished more easily by waiting until this point.An increased need for closenessAs your child weans he will have a continued, perhaps even stronger, need for closeness with you. In fact, some mothers have success with weaning older children by offering to nurse at every opportunity. Once a child realises his mother is willing to let him breastfeed whenever he wants, he may simply abandon the need. Plan plenty of ’special time’ with your child. Meeting his general need for closeness may help him feel more secure, so reducing his need for nursing.Comments from othersYour biggest challenge may be coping with opinions of others on how long you should continue tobreastfeed and how weaning should happen.Because of this you may start feeling uncomfortable about nursing your older toddler in front of others. Some mothers set limits on where and when they nurse, or offer distractions at times when it’s inconvenient. Selecting your clothing carefully can help avoid accidental overexposure and choosing a codeword for breastfeeding such as ’num-nums’ makes it less obvious when your child asks to nurse when out and about.Finding supportThe decision to wean is a very personal one. Your feelings about nursing are important—more important than any advice from others. Many new mothers cannot envisage nursing a baby beyondsix months, let alone a year. But perceptions often change as the breastfeeding relationship grows and develops, and many a mother nurses her baby for longer than initially intended. A La Leche League Leader will always be willing to help you tailor weaning to suit your needs and those of your child, so that your progress towards total weaning becomes more enjoyable.

Breastfeeding & contact cases,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-contact-cases/,"Contact (custody) cases are often a balancing act.  An English or Welsh Court will primarily have regard to the overriding objective in all England and Wales family law cases, which is: “what is in the best interests of the child”. This includes consideration of a list of factors including the baby or child’s physical, emotional and psychological health. Some guidelines in Scotland may differ.The Court will consider the wishes of both parents to have contact with their child, alongside what is appropriate for that infant at that time.  When a child in a contact case is breastfed it can add another layer of fact and wellbeing into the mix. Breastfeeding is an intense and enormously important part of a mother-child relationship and it can be very distressing to be told that it may have to be compromised to fit in with contact with the other parent.While LLLGB cannot offer legal advice, we can offer support with any breastfeeding difficulties and provide information which may be helpful.

In some cases some mothers have been able to successfully negotiate delayed overnight access for their child.  Providing research to show why overnight access could be distressing may help.Separation studyA Study which may be helpful was done by US researchers at the University of Virginia, July 2013. The researchers set out to discover what happens when babies under 12 months old spend a night or more per week away from their mothers, as increasingly happens when separated parents share custody.They found that such infants had more insecure attachments to their mothers compared with babies who had fewer overnight stays or saw their fathers only during the day.Lead author Samantha Tornello, a PhD psychology student at the University, said attachments during the critical first year serve as the basis for healthy relationships in adulthood.  She was reported as saying “Judges often find themselves making decisions regarding custody without knowing what actually may be in the best interest of the child, based on psychology research.’(The findings were published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, based on data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study of about 5,000 children born in US cities from 1998 to 2000. Parents were interviewed several times and children were assessed at ages one and three.)Attachment TheoryMany well-respected psychologists and scientists have written about Attachment Theory. This Theory was developed in the 1960s by British psychologist John Bowlby (http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesal/p/john-bowlby.htm). He showed that babies need a primary care figure to form an attachment to and that this is important for emotional security.  For a young child this often means they need to be with their mother and to be able to breastfeed for comfort as well as nutrition. More recently both Dr Margot Sunderland (Director of Education and Training at the Centre of Child Mental Health Londonhttp://www.margotsunderland.org/) and Sue Gerhardt  have written about this.   Providing information about Attachment Theory may be helpful.The human right to breastfeedA legal provision which might be worth emphasising is Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which describes the right to respect for an individual’s private and family life. A baby, like all human beings, has a right to “physical and moral integrity” (covered under the concept of private life, according to the European Court of Human Rights), which might include the continuing physical and emotional significance of breastfeeding. It is possible that a disproportionate interruption/disruption of nursing and/or time with mother could arguably be a breach of that right.Possible negotiationThe first step in any case would be to try to negotiate with your partner a contact arrangement which takes account of the breastfeeding relationship.  A mother may be able to negotiate a shared parenting plan that takes into account breastfeeding, with the understanding that it would be flexible as the child grows. A solicitor can make any agreement a legal document.If you can’t negotiate it’s really important to get a solicitor you feel will listen to you and who understands the importance of breastfeeding. It may be assumed that a woman may be more sympathetic than a man but this is not necessarily the case. It is absolutely fine to take initial advice from more than one solicitor, until you find the person who represents your views and position in the best possible way for you.  Solicitors will often offer a free initial consultation so that you might decide this.Where the breastfeeding relationship is a mother’s priority it may be necessary to compromise on other issues. Unfortunately, making breastfeeding the sole issue can sometimes be counter-productive. Dividing up issues and dealing with one at time may help.   Keeping calm may be difficult but getting angry can hinder negotiations.The health significance of breastfeedingNot breastfeeding results in increased health risks to both mother and child, both short-term and long-term, physical and emotional.  It can be helpful to have a knowledgeable paediatrician speak up about why breastfeeding is of such importance.  There is a lot of helpful information on the internet which can be useful to give to a lawyer to give them a better view of why you parent as you do.Here is a list of some things which may be helpful in demonstrating the importance of breastfeeding.The difference between breastmilk and formulaBreastmilk contains living cells, hormones, active enzymes, antibodies and compounds with unique structures that can never be replicated in formula. It adapts to suit our own baby. Cows’ milk is designed to help calves grow fast and put on lots of muscle. Breast milk contains lots of omega-3 essential fats, which are known to have an important role in the development and function of the brain, along with gradual physical growth.The composition of human milk changes to meet the changing needs of baby as he matures, and even from feed to feed. Even when baby is able to take solids, human milk is the best source of nutrition during the first year.  It becomes a supplement to solids during the second year but keeps nutritional value, as well as emotional benefits.The significance to the immune systemIt takes between two and six years for a child’s immune system to fully mature. Human milk continues to complement and boost the immune system for as long as offered, helping the baby remain healthy and fight germs to which either the mother or baby have been exposed.The significance to a child’s healthBreastfed babies are less likely to suffer from a range of conditions such as gastroenteritis, chest infections, eczema, asthma, celiac disease, crohn’s disease, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, ear infections, diabetes in childhood, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood obesity, urinary tract infections and childhood leukaemia and other cancers.  Just 2 months of exclusive breastfeeding helps lower the risk and/or severity of allergies. There is a lower risk of urinary tract infections after 5 months.There is evidence that the longer a baby is breastfed the greater the protection from ill health and the more positive impact on their long-term health.  A breastfed baby is five times less likely to be hospitalised with gastroenteritis and on average will visit the doctor 15% less in the first six months.The effect on a mother’s healthBreastfeeding also reduces a mother’s risk of developing breast, ovarian, cervical and uterine cancer.  It protects a mother against developing osteoporosis, with a reduced risk of postnatal depression, and helps the woman’s uterus to return to normal size after giving birth and helps to lose weight.  There is a lower risk of diabetes type 2 among women who breastfeed.The effect on emotional healthA breastfed baby may become very distressed if separated from their mother, and intense, extended crying causes cortisol (stress) levels to rise, which can lead to long-term problems. The gastrointestinal hormone, cholecystokinine (CCK) hormone helps both mother and baby to relax and sleep. Breastfeeding has been shown to lower blood pressure and this effect is ongoing.Breastmilk is not just about getting food into a baby, it is part of the mothering relationship. It is the natural way to be close to a baby and helps with bonding. Recent studies have shown a reduced risk of maternal neglect amongst breastfeeding mothers. The mothering hormones prolactin and oxytocin help a mother care for her baby by lowering her blood pressure and helping her to relax physically.Arguing against breastfeedingMothers sometimes have to contend with the suggestion that they are continuing to breastfeeding to fill their own needs and to control their child.  It may be suggested that there are no benefits for the child. It’s possible that in making breastfeeding the main issue a judge could view this as an attempt to interfere with the rights of the other parent.  It is sometimes claimed that the breastfeeding relationship can or should be curtailed, with the mother being portrayed as leading an alternative lifestyle which is affecting her child; or as being overly attached to her child.Katherine Dettwyler, PH.D., Department of Anthropology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, has written an open letter to be used in court cases which clearly sets out the biological norm of breastfeeding. You can read ithere.It may be possible to turn this argument around and ask the other partner to provide evidence which shows good reason why breastfeeding is not beneficial.Will breastfeeding have to end?When a breastfed child has contact time with her other parent it doesn’t mean breastfeeding has to end.  Depending on the child’s age a mother may be able to talk to her about the situation and help her to cope with a new routine, if it comes to it.  If a mother can be positive about the change and present it as an “adventure” where the child will be doing things with the other parent it can help to ease the transition.Children are surprisingly adaptable in their nursing habits.   Even young babies whose mothers go back to work and leave them for many hours have been seen to adapt so that they sleep and do not feed much while mum is away, but make up for it when she comes home.Some women have told us that they have gone away for a few days and their older breastfed child has been perfectly happy while they are away, but has returned to the breast when they returned.   Sometimes a mother has suddenly had to be separated due to family illness or going into hospital and an older child can understand this.  They can have an ability to understand when mum is not there to nurse them and a different routine with the other partner.It may help to explain that when she gets home you will be there waiting with (her name for nursing).  Some children will need to nurse a lot more for a while although others may need gentle encouragement to continue nursing. Although this is not ideal it will hopefully make it possible to continue your nursing relationship.How LLL can helpLLLGB Leaders can support the breastfeeding relationship and offer practical information, including information on pumping, avoiding engorgement and mastitis.  We understand that this will be an emotional time and even one of grieving for the loss of the breastfeeding relationship the mother had hoped for. The lovely, secure emotional bond mothers give their children through the breastfeeding relationship is something which will always stay with them. While any separation will not be easy, with some compromises it should be possible for this to continue as long as you both want.Written by Anna Burbidge and Johanna Rhys-Davies.Further ReadingStill nursingBreastfeeding beyond a yearNursing StrikesWhen breastfeeding ends suddenlyUseful linksWHO infant feeding recommendationKaterine Dettwyler’s open letter for use in court casesBreastfeeding Past Infancy: Fact SheetAttachment Parenting International resources on divorce, custody & blended familiesLancet research on long-term benefits to breastfeedingWhy Love Matters: How Affection Shapes a Baby’s Brain by Sue Gerhardt, Routledge, London, 2004.What Every Parent Needs to Know: The incredible effects of love, nurture and play on your child’s development by Margot Sunderland, DK, 2007.A Secure Base by John Bowlby, Basic Books, reprint edition 1990.Copyright LLLGB 2016"
Out & About With Your Breastfed Baby,https://laleche.org.uk/out-about-with-your-breastfed-baby/,"Early daysPublic placePlanning aheadA flexible approachTime for social activityTravelling with your babyEarly daysAfter giving birth to your baby, you may prefer to be close to home. Rest, along with frequent will help you regain your strength and build up a good milk supply while getting to know your baby. When you feel ready to go out, a short walk or drive to your local shops or to visit a friend or relative may be enough.Going out can prevent you from feeling isolated and give structure to your day. Breastfed babies are very portable—with your baby in a sling or carrier, you may only need a nappy or two and away you go. Babies will often sleep contentedly when carried close to their mothers, so you may even get there and back while your baby is asleep.Public placesMothers often worry about breastfeeding in public spaces such as shops and cafés. But the law protects you when you breastfeed in a public place and on premises. It is against the law to discriminate against a breastfeeding mother throughout the UK, although protection varies slightly depending on location.In England and WalesA woman cannot be prosecuted for breastfeeding under public decency laws. A mother can ignore people who ask her to stop feeding and she can just carry on. Unfortunately though, she has no specific legal protection against their actual comments objecting to breastfeeding. If, however, the remarks become aggressive or abusive then women have a right to report this as with any other form of abuse.In ScotlandUnder Scottish legislation, it is an offence to deliberately prevent or stop a woman from breastfeeding in a public place. If a mother is approached by anyone, anywhere, and asked to stop breastfeeding, she has the right to phone the police who will attend, discuss with the person involved, and warn them that they are committing an offence liable to a fine of up to £2,500.In Northern IrelandBreastfeeding mothers are protected by sex discrimination laws that prohibit anyone from treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding and the Government intends to introduce specific legislation to support and protect breastfeeding infants and their mothers in public places.Planning aheadA crying baby will guarantee an audience so watch for early feeding cues so you have time to find a suitable place. Other people probably won’t notice you’re breastfeeding if you’re relaxed and confident—especially if you continue chatting or reading the menu and avoid eye contact with passers-by.If you prefer to keep covered then lifting your top from the waist means your baby hides your tummy and you remain covered on top. Layering can help – depending on the weather try an open blouse, shirt or cardigan over a t-shirt. A breastfeeding vest can cover your tummy. Some baby slings and carriers can also hide a feeding baby and a baby sun hat can work well too. If you feel self-conscious, try practising in front of your partner, a friend or a mirror.With time, you’ll learn what you’re likely to need while out with your baby. Include nappies, baby wipes and a change of baby clothes. It’s also worth taking a favourite toy for older babies. Don’t forget a bottle of water for yourself— breastfeeding can make you thirsty. A baby sling or carrier can be easier than a pram or buggy where there are steps or uneven surfaces. It also keeps your baby close. If you have shopping to carry, a pushchair can be helpful—you can still take a sling to carry your baby if they get restless!Handling leaksIf you leak milk between feeds you can use breast pads inside your bra to provide protection. Some breast pads made of silicon, use gentle pressure to completely prevent leaking. If you feel the tingling of your milk beginning to flow, pressing hard on your nipples for several seconds can prevent leaking. You can do this by crossing your arms tightly across your chest and pressing firmly on your nipples with the palms of your hands. Hold for a few seconds before releasing and all should be well. If it doesn’t work first time, try again for a little longer. If your breasts feel full, this is a sign to take the time to nurse your baby. Patterned fabrics, layered clothing and scarves can all hide evidence of leaks.Where to breastfeedMothers breastfeed in many public places with seating areas: shopping, leisure and visitor centres, libraries, museums and more. Look out for quiet spots with fewer distractions as some babies insist on looking around instead of feeding when there’s a lot of hustle and bustle! A town garden or park may be an option when the weather is good. Or visit a café or the family room of a pub. You can also breastfeed while walking with your baby in a sling.If you prefer privacy, many public places have mother and baby rooms where you can sit to nurse and change your baby’s nappy. Some clothes shops will make a changing room available to a nursing mother at quiet times.A flexible approachRather than thinking of nursing as a major event around which to structure the day, it can help to treat it as you would a coffee break—something that happens along with the other events of the day. If you nurse your baby at fixed intervals, they may need to nurse for an hour or more to take sufficient milk. It can be hard to get out and about with a baby who is feeding for long periods of time. While a baby nursing little and often is more likely to need to breastfeed while you are out, it can be easier to fit in shorter nursing sessions. Many babies become very efficient at breastfeeding by the age of three months and feeds can be accomplished very quickly.Keeping some flexibility in feeding and sleeping rhythms can also make life easier when travelling, on holiday, visiting family etc as strict routines can be difficult to follow in those situations. When you follow your baby’s natural feeding and sleeping rhythms such problems are less likely and you may feel more relaxed about visiting relatives or taking a family holiday.Time for social activityBreastfeeding becomes much easier when you spend time with others who are breastfeeding. Local LLL groups are a good starting point—offering mother-to-mother support and the chance to socialise. You’ll also be able to see how other mothers handle breastfeeding in a public place, and gather ideas. You may well develop good friendships to support you in your new mothering role.Travelling with your babyBreastmilk is the ultimate travel food. There’s no need to carry any feeding equipment and your baby’s favourite food will always be on hand, even if your journey is delayed.Public transportWhen hopping on and off buses and trains a carrier or sling is a real boon, with or without a pushchair.If you take a pushchair, modern train doors are usually wide enough and many buses have low floors for easy access.A backpack can be a useful handbag, leaving your hands free for your baby.In the carPlan to stop frequently and give your baby breaks from their car seat. It can help to time long journeys for when they usually sleep. Avoid rush hour if you can.Place your car seat where you can safely see your baby as you drive. An extra mirror can be useful if your baby travels in the back.Bear in mind that if your baby gets upset this can distract you while driving. Letting someone else drive when possible leaves you free to calm your baby.Babies are usually happier in the car if they can see you or another adult. You could talk or sing to your baby to reassure them you are there. If your baby doesn’t like the car it may be easier to take public transport so you can hold and nurse them as you travel.FlyingA sling or soft carrier can be really convenient at the airport. It can also give you privacy as you nurse during the flight.It can be useful to request a bulkhead seat to give you more space. Alternatively having an aisle seat allows you to get up easily if your baby is restless without disturbing other passengers.Take a few of your baby’s favourite toys and, if possible, familiar snacks if they have started eating solid food.Breastfeeding during take off and landing can help equalize the pressure in your baby’s ears, keeping them comfortable. However, to comply with seat belt regulations you may need to nurse in an unusual position. If seat belts make breastfeeding too awkward, offering your baby a finger or suitable toy to suck on may do the trick. When the seat belt light goes out, you can nurse them as normal.There are specific airline regulations for carrying expressed breastmilk in flight hand luggage.

Amazing Milk,https://laleche.org.uk/amazing-milk/,"Breastmilk has everything a growing baby needs in exactly the right amounts and is easy to digest. Research shows that a baby who is not breastfed is more likely to suffer from health problems, both as a child and throughout adulthood.Can anyone breastfeed?Breastfeeding is the normal, natural way to feed and care for a baby and babies are born expecting to breastfeed. Women all over the world, regardless of their diet, produce the right type and amount of milk to nourish their growing babies, whether it’s one or more!Women who are not able to exclusively breastfeed can choose to partially breastfeed, using supplements as needed so their baby still benefits from breastmilk. For those facing breastfeeding challenges,skilled help is available from LLL Leaders.Breastmilk contains:Stem cellswhich are used by the baby. Stem cells create and repair the body, and they are a key part of treatments for many illnesses and diseases. [1]Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)– sugars which are indigestible to the baby but feed friendly bacteria lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (among others). These are crucial to the development of a healthy gut microbiome, which kickstarts the immune system, promotes good digestion, and reduces the growth of unfriendly bacteria. An imbalanced microbiome could affect lifetime health and increase the risk of all non-infectious diseases. [2]Antibodieswhich are specifically tailored to bacteria and viruses found in your environment. Just 20 mins after being exposed to an infectious agent a mother is producing the right antibody in her milk. [1, 3]Immune cells, cytokines and antimicrobial factorswhich all help support the baby while his immune system is still developing (approx. 6 yrs). [2]Oxytocin– a hormone which reduces stress and promotes feelings of well-being in mum and baby. [1]Alpha-lactalbumin– a protein with pain relief properties. [1]Extra melatonin at nightwhich helps mum and baby go back to sleep quickly. [4]Healthier for lifeStudies show your baby will be healthier throughout their life if they are breastfed. Infant formula increases a child’s risk of:SIDS, Cancer, Obesity, Diabetes, and Allergies. [5]In addition to an increased risk of:Asthma, Autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis and coeliac disease, Cardiovascular disease, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, Dental caries, Diarrhoea, Ear infections, Epilepsy, Gastroenteritis, High blood pressure and high cholesterol, Hypersensitivity and inflammation, Liver disease, Mental health issues, Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), Respiratory infections including bronchiolitis, and Urinary tract infections. [5, 6]Babies have tiny tummies and breastmilk is digested quickly so a newborn baby breastfeeds at least 8–12 times in a 24 hour period. The first time a newborn baby feeds he only takes about a teaspoon of milk (colostrum) but this provides his first immunity boost and lines and protects his intestines.Infant Formula:Is a breastmilk substituteInfant formula is a highly processed food: a base of cow’s milk, goat’s milk or soy, with vegetable oils and other additives. Breastmilk is a complete and perfect food for your baby – nature has been refining your breastmilk for hundreds of millions of years. [1]Can never accurately replicate human milkBreastmilk is a living tissue, just like blood. It changes throughout feeds and from feed to feed to match your baby’s needs. We can’t accurately synthesise artificial breastmilk. Many breastmilk components have unique structures that can’t be made in a factory.Cow’s milk for calves, breastmilk for human babiesCow’s milk is designed to help calves grow fast and put on lots of muscle. Human breastmilk builds intelligent human brains with gradual physical growth.Reasons to breastfeedGood for MumBreastfeeding:Helps the uterus return to normal size after giving birth.Is the natural way to be close to your baby and encourages a strong mother-baby bond.

Keeping your baby close at night makesnight-feedingeasier too.Breastfeeding is eco-friendlyBreastmilk is the most environmentally friendly baby food imaginable! Bottle feeding produces pollution and waste disposal problems due to the manufacture, packaging, transport and preparation of the formula and bottles.Position is importantGetting a baby positioned and latched on comfortably at the breastis the key to enjoyable feeds and making enough milk. Breastfeeding is normal and natural, but it’s an art that can take both mum and baby a bit of time and practice to learn. One of the best ways to find out about breastfeeding is to watch and learn from other breastfeeding mothers.You can breastfeed anywhereBabies often want to breastfeed when people around them are eating and drinking – and why not?
