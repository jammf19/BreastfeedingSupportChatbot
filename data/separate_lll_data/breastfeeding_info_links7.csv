Diabetes and Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/diabetes-and-breastfeeding/,"Breastfeeding is the normal and natural way to feed and nurture a baby. If you have diabetes you may be concerned about whether you can breastfeed. The answer is yes.All mothers experience metabolic and hormonal changes after giving birth. A mother with diabetes who breastfeeds has an advantage as breastfeeding reduces the impact of these changes. When you breastfeed, your body continues to support you and your baby, making your diabetes easier to manage in the days after birth. Later on, gradual weaning helps you to maintain control of your diabetes.Gestational diabetesBenefits of breastfeedingWhat about medications?Be preparedBlood glucose controlLarger babyBabies can have a hypo after birthAntenatal expression of colostrumGet breastfeeding off to a good startLooking after yourselfAdjusting your dietGestational diabetesIt can be a shock if you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes during your pregnancy. This is usually a temporary condition in which your body fails to produce enough insulin to meet your extra needs while you are pregnant. It is usually diagnosed from the fourth month of pregnancy. Just like mothers who are on long-term treatment for diabetes, good control of blood glucose levels will minimise any problems for you and your baby. You may not need any extra medical care during labour and delivery. Diabetes treatment is usually unnecessary once you have given birth.Benefits of breastfeedingFor you (as a diabetic mother)Breastfeeding increases your insulin sensitivity and has long term positive effects on your glucose metabolism.• For Type-1 diabetes, breastfeeding will reduce the amount of insulin you need.• For Type-2 diabetes, breastfeeding will reduce the severity of your diabetes.• For Gestational diabetes, breastfeeding significantly reduces your risk of developing diabetes later in life.Breastfeeding suppresses your periods and monthly hormonal changes.See our pageAmazing milkfor more information.For your babyStudies show that your baby will behealthier throughout their lifeif they are breastfed. Infant formula increases a baby’s chance of developing diabetes.What about medicationsInsulin treatment is compatible with breastfeeding. Insulin molecules are too large to pass into your milk. Check with your doctor for up-to-date information on any other medications you take. If there is any concern over safety, an LLL Leader can obtain information on named medications for you.Be preparedHaving diabetes can increase the risk of the following problems which may impact breasfeeding:• Premature birth•Caesarean birth• Newborn hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)•Newborn jaundice.See Further reading at the end of the page for a selection of resources to help avoid these problems and overcome difficulties. You may also like to find out about your local hospital’s policies on the management of these and care of diabetic mothers during and after pregnancy.Do ask if the hospital has an Infant Feeding Advisor who will be well informed about breastfeeding and a source of support in those early days.Blood glucose controlThis is the key to avoiding problems in pregnancy, labour and after birth.If you are planning a pregnancy, practise good diabetes management before you conceive too.• Frequent antenatal and diabetes medical care will allow you to address any problems quickly.• Discuss with the doctors, nurses and dieticians in your diabetes team how to control your changing needs for insulin, other medication and food while pregnant and after birth.• You may be given a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) which will notify you if your blood glucose levels get too high or too low.• Monitor your blood glucose levels closely, so you can adjust your insulin, other medication and food intake.You may need to eat frequent smaller meals a day to avoid hypos (hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose levels) and peaks in blood glucose levels.Larger babyEven with excellent control, diabetic mothers tend to have larger than average babies. Good blood glucose control will help limit how large your baby grows, making birth easier and reducing the risk of complications.Babies can have a hypo after birthYour baby will be prone to hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels) during the first 12 hours after birth, particularly if you have poor blood glucose control in pregnancy. Even with good control, your baby will have been used to relatively high levels of glucose before he was born. The extra insulin he produces can lead to a drop in blood glucose after birth. Skin-to-skin contact, and early frequent breastfeeding will help avoid problems.Check your hospital’s policy for testing blood glucose levels and treating a baby’s hypo. Your colostrum (first milk) is the best food for your baby if he has a hypo. If your baby has not breastfed yet, stored colostrum can be given.Antenatal expression of colostrumIn the last few weeks of pregnancy you can express some colostrum (early milk). This can be given to your baby if he can’t breastfeed after birth, or he needs supplements for any reason eg hypoglycaemia. Our information sheetAntenatal Expression of Colostrumexplains how to do this before birth so you have some of your milk immediately available for your baby should he need any supplement.Get breastfeeding off to a good startThe first few daysFor many mothers with diabetes, milk production increases later than for mothers who don’t have diabetes. You can help your milk production increase normally on the third or fourth day with good control of blood glucose. Fluctuations in insulin levels will affect milk production, and increase the risk of your baby needing supplements.Get skilled breastfeeding help sooner rather than later to reduce the need for supplements.Your baby will need to stay in hospital for at least 24 hours after birth, until he is feeding well and maintaining blood glucose levels.Breastfeeding basics• Hold your baby against your skin after birth so he can breastfeed as soon as possible, ideally within the first hour after birth.• Keep your baby with you unless separation is medically necessary.• Try to breastfeed every hour for the first several hours, until your baby’s blood glucose levels stabilise. Ensure your baby feeds at least 8-12 times each 24 hour period.• Spend as much time as you can holding your baby and encouraging him to feed frequently.Separation and supplementsTake action if you and your baby are separated or if your baby needs supplements for any reason.• Hand express small amounts of colostrum frequently to give to your baby. This will also help you establish milk production.• Once you can express larger amounts, you can use a hospital-grade pump.• Your baby can be given your milk with a syringe, cup or spoon.Being separated from your new baby will be hard for you. As soon as you can, spend as much time as possible with him to help make up for lost time. Even visiting him in the neonatal intensive care (NICU) or special care baby unit (SCBU) will help, as you will be able to touch, stroke and talk to him and take over some of his care. You can ask to give him kangaroo mother care, in which a baby is snuggled skin-to-skin against mum’s chest. Kangaroo care helps to stabilise a baby’s heartbeat, temperature and breathing, and encourages breastfeeding. The hormones produced will help you express your milk, even if you can’t breastfeed straight away.Looking after yourselfAfter birthAt first your blood glucose levels can change rapidly and you are at increased risk of having a hypo. Take suitable snacks into hospital so you have something readily available —and watch out for early signs of hypos.Later you’ll have to manage your own health while caring for your baby. Keep suitable snacks and drinks within arms reach in all the places you are likely to breastfeed your baby to treat hypos at the first signs.Seek skilled help straight away if you experience sore nipples or breasts, to reduce the risk of an infection. You are more at risk from a thrush infection of the nipple area if you have diabetes.Rest when you canLack of sleep can make it harder to manage your diabetes and be a cause of stress, which means youor blood glucose levels will run higher. Try to rest when your baby sleeps and accept offers of practical help from others when you need to.Adjusting your dietBreastfeeding helps your body adjust gradually to the metabolic and hormonal changes all mothers experience after birth.You may need to eat many more extra calories a day while breastfeeding, eating regularly to maintain blood sugar levels. This will allow you to use your fat stores without the risk of ketones in your blood and urine.Further supportYourlocal LLL Leader and Groupcan be a source of information and support.

Smoking & Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/smoking-breastfeeding/,"Breastfeeding your baby is still the best choice you can make, even if you can’t stop smoking.Breastfeeding provides significant health benefits for mothers and babies. For babies, it reduces their risk of diabetes, certain cancers, respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and many other health problems. For mothers, it protects against breast cancer, helps with postnatal weight loss, and encourages a unique mother-child bond that can’t be duplicated.Breastfeeding is just as beneficial for the smoking mother and her baby as it is for the non-smoking mother and her baby. Research has shown that babies of smokers are at increased risk of colic, respiratory infections, and SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or cot death).But breastfed babies are at lower risk for these diseases compared to artificially fed ones, even when their mothers continue to smoke.And breastfeeding helps to protect babies from the potential risks of cigarette smoke. Breastfeeding and smoking may well be less harmful to the child than bottle feeding and smoking.Cut down on smokingSmoke after breastfeedingMonitor your baby’s weightProtecting your baby against SIDSRelaxationNicotine replacement therapyContinue breastfeedingCut down on smokingFewer cigarettes smoked means less smoke in the air, lower levels of nicotine in your milk, better health for everyone, and more time with your baby. Smoke as far away from your baby as possible To prevent exposing your baby to smoke and particles small enough to inhale, any smoker in your household should smoke outside or at least in another room, away from your baby. Some health professionals suggest that family members who smoke should always wash their hands after smoking and before touching the baby. A smoker can also wear a jacket or other outer garment while smoking to protect clothing from smoke particles. This garment can then be removed before any contact with the baby so that the baby will be exposed to fewer smoke particles.Smoke after breastfeedingWhen a breastfeeding mother smokes, the nicotine levels in her blood and milk rise, and then fall over time. So, smoking straight after breastfeeding minimizes the amount of nicotine in your milk. About 95 minutes after smoking, the level of nicotine in a mother’s blood and milk has fallen by about half. Your baby will probably want to nurse frequently in the early weeks, so you won’t always be able to wait that long between smoking and the next feed. Frequent breastfeeding is good for your milk production and ensures that your baby gets enough to eat. Medications and Mothers’ Milk by Thomas Hale, 2012, states “Mothers should be advised to limit smoking as much as possible and to smoke only after they have fed their infant, or to switch to the use of nicotine patches.”Monitor your baby’s weightSome research suggests that smoking affects a baby’s weight gain, while other research shows no difference between babies of smoking and non-smoking mothers. So, monitor your baby’s weight regularly and talk to anLLL Leaderor your health visitor about any concerns. There are simple ways to increase your milk production.Protecting your baby against SIDSSmoking increases the likelihood of your baby suffering Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death. Sharing a room with your baby for at least the first 6 months helps to protect against SIDS and also helps with night-time breastfeeding. If you or your partner smoke, you should make sure that you never fall asleep with your baby in bed. Your baby’s risk of SIDS is increased if he sleeps in a bed with a smoker. You shouldnever sleep with your baby on a sofa or armchair, whether you are a smoker or not (UNICEF 2011). See our page onSafe Sleep & the Breastfed Baby.RelaxationSmoking is a stress-relieving mechanism for many people. Finding other ways of relaxing can help you cope with nicotine withdrawal:Enjoy cuddling and playing with your baby.Go for a walk, get some fresh air, visit the park and feed the ducks. Take him swimming.Get some rest. Use the relaxation exercises taught in pregnancy. Or have a shower or bath.Read a book or magazine; chat to other mums on social media, findLLLGB Facebook groupsand pages . Crafts like knitting can occupy your hands.Take advantage of non smoking public places to avoid temptation.Meet up with other mothers, including atLLL meetings.Nicotine replacement therapyCommercial products may help you to give up smoking and their use protects your whole family from carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants in the air. It is worth asking a health professional about the most appropriate therapy and dosage to meet your needs. Use nicotine gum, lozenges, microtabs or nasal spray immediately after a breastfeed so that blood levels of nicotine have time to fall before the next feed. This may be 2 to 3 hours for nicotine gum. Nicotine patches provide a steady level of nicotine in your blood and milk. That level can be lower than the level of nicotine when smoking—use a patch with the lowest level of nicotine possible to satisfy your cravings. Remove the patch at night to reduce levels of nicotine during night-time feeds. Research has shown that use of nicotine patches is a safer option than continuing to smoke.Hale 2012 states: “The risk of using nicotine patches while breastfeeding is much less than the risk of formula feeding.” Nicotine inhalers give lower blood levels of nicotine than cigarettes, and levels of nicotine are probably too low to affect a breastfeeding baby (Hale 2012).Electronic cigarettes have not been well studied and are not recommended. NEVER smoke cigarettes when using nicotine replacement products. Smoking while using replacement products may produce dangerous levels of nicotine in your blood and milkContinue breastfeedingThere is no need to stop breastfeeding because you are smoking. Remember that breastfeeding offers your baby protection from the very respiratory diseases you may be worried about.There are plenty of reasons to stop smoking, both for you and your baby. You’ve probably heard about many of them already. Decide what is realistic for you to do, based on your own circumstances. You could stop smoking during pregnancy and while you are breastfeeding. Otherwise try to minimize the effects by smoking away from your baby, allowing as much time as possible between smoking a cigarette and the next breastfeed, and by keeping the number of cigarettes smoked per day as low as possible.Less smoking in your household will be good for your whole family’s health, not just your baby’s. Stop or cut down if you possibly can, but remember that even if you can’t, breastfeeding still provides significant health benefits for both you and your baby. If you would like to discuss this with an LLL Leader you can call ourHelpline. A Leader will also be able to give you information aboutLLL meetingswhere you can chat with other breastfeeding mothers.Adapted by Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGB from an original text by LLLI with thanks to Amy Conway and Kathy Koch, IBCLC for their help with compiling the original information.Inclusion of pictures does not imply that the mothers smoke.Further ReadingAdjusting To MotherhoodIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?Rhythms & RoutinesSafe Sleep & the Breastfed BabyBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding and Jury Service,https://laleche.org.uk/breastfeeding-and-jury-servic/,"If a woman is summoned for jury service while still breastfeeding it has sometimes proved stressful to get exemption from serving. There can be a lack of understanding and knowledge and an assumption is made that formula can be substituted.  If a simple explanation that a woman is breastfeeding and cannot leave her baby is not accepted then it may be possible to use some of these suggestions.Equality Act 2010Possible risks for mother and babyHuman Rights ActDoctor’s letterEquality Act 2010Under the Equality Act 2010 it is sex discrimination to fail to assess or take action on health and safety risks for a breastfeeding woman where the work could involve risks with serious consequences for mother or baby.It is indirect sex discrimination under the Equality Act for an employer to refuse a flexible working request from a breastfeeding mother if there are not good business reasons for the refusal, and if it results in the mother stopping breastfeeding. This could be applied to being asked to leave a baby.Possible risks for mother and babyRisks for a mother developingengorgementormastitis, a very painful condition, because she will not be able to feed her baby while in court, and there may not be the facilities or time for her to express.It will also be emotionally difficult, and the stress of being separated from her baby, along with discomfort and anxiety may mean it will be hard for her to listen carefully to evidence.  If she feels that the court’s inability to make provision for her health situation will compromise her ability to listen, absorb and assess the evidence then this needs to be made clear.  Not only are the juror’s rights being compromised but the accused has a right to a just and fair trial, which might be affected if the mother is feeling ill.Risks for the baby include the unavailability of breastfeeding to provide nourishment and comfort.  It is often assumed that a baby can just take milk from a bottle but the action of feeding is very different and many cannot adjust.  A baby should not have to have formula against a mother’s wishes, and it takes time to build up an adequate supply of expressed milk. The baby may feel emotional distress being away from his mother.Being separated will also mean that milk supply will drop down with consequences for the future.  It may take time for the mother to increase her supply once more, and lead to distress for her and the baby.Human Rights ActIt may also be possible to object to serving under article 8 Human Rights Act.  This applies to a woman’s rights to physical integrity. She might also argue that it is inhuman and degrading to be preventing from removing milk from her body, particularly is she is also refused the right to pump.  If a mother is told she cannot pump while serving on a jury she might complain to court staff or the judge that article 3 of the Human Rights Act (inhumane and degrading treatment) might be breached.Courts are a public body and, as such, must respect and adhere to the human rights of anyone within the court system. A mother would need to make it clear that she is being put at serious health risk by not being allowed to express breastmilk.For some women simply having court staff who are supportive and pleasant, and being provided with facilities toexpresswould make it possible for them to serve on a jury.Doctor’s letterIt may be possible to ask a doctor to provide a letter stating a woman is breastfeeding and is not eligible for jury service.  It is to be hoped that courts now have a better understanding of breastfeeding and that in future women can decline jury service without being involved in a stressful situation.If you still have concerns about  your summons for jury service you can talk to anLLL Leader.Written by Anna Burbidge.Further ReadingSupporting Women’s Right to BreastfeedThe Breastfeeding DyadCopyright LLLGB 2016"
Toddlers and Food,https://laleche.org.uk/toddlers-and-food/,"In a world where thinness is sometimes associated with eating disorders and neglect, and obesity with health risks, it’s natural to be concerned about what and how much your child is eating. Mothers often worry that their toddlers don’t eat enough.How toddlers eatToddlers can be remarkably picky eaters, whether or not they still breastfeed. They may refuse to eat foods they have eaten happily in the past or eat everything in sight one day and nothing the next. Sometimes they may seem to eat even less than they did when they were younger. Toddlers can also be unadventurous in their food preferences, opting for familiar favourites.Will they grow?It’s easy to assume that a child who has a limited diet or is not eating much will not grow. But it’s not the case that children grow because they are eating—they eat because they are growing. If food is available and a child is not ill then they will eat until their body tells them they have had enough. This natural appetite control mechanism helps prevent overeating and obesity.How much does he need?Even babies who have taken to solid foods quickly often start to eat less at around 12 months. This can be worrying for parents since we naturally expect our babies to keep eating more as they get bigger. In fact, a child may not need substantially more calories at 12 months or even at two years than he did at six or nine months. This is because his optimal growth rate is normally fastest in the first 12 months. After that, it slows down. If your toddler is still taking plenty of breastmilk he may not need very much extra at all in the way of solid foods.Think in child-sized portionsIt’s easy to forget how small a child’s stomach is, especially when serving pre-packaged foods that come in adult portions such as yoghurt or snacks. Even commercial baby foods come in generous portions. Thinking in child-sized handfuls can help you offer an appropriate portion for his size. A toddler portion could be 1⁄4 of a small banana, 15ml (1 tablespoon) of yoghurt or less than half a slice of bread. If you’re convinced your child really does ‘live on air’ try keeping a note of everything they eat for a week. Include nursing, snacks and drinks and remember to think in ‘toddler portions’. If they really ate nothing they would be obviously losing weight.Measuring growthThe World Health Organization growth charts, based on breastfed babies growing in optimal conditions, are now being adopted in the UK (see Further Reading). Growth charts have been created by combining data from a large sample of healthy babies. The smoothed centile lines don’t represent how an individual baby grows. In reality, growth is uneven and does not continuously follow the chart lines. This is why it’s not helpful to plot weight too often. Genes influence height and weight as well as how the body absorbs and uses food. It doesn’t matter which centile your child’s height and weight are following if they are well and if they continue to grow in height and gain weight over several months. When assessing whether your toddler is thriving consider developmental milestones in addition to weight, height and head circumference. If they have recently had an infection, their growth may have faltered, but it’s likely to catch up soon after recovery. If your child is unwell, their growth pattern is markedly different from the charts, or if they are losing weight, seek advice from your GP.They don’t like it“My child rejects pasta, bread and vegetables but he’ll happily gobble up chocolate cake.” Try not to fall into the trap of offering lots of alternatives just to be sure they have at least eaten something. Most of us can find room for a sweet treat even if we’re not really hungry and this leaves us even less hungry for the next meal! The best way to avoid this happening is to limit puddings and sweet snacks or offer small portions as a nutritious part of the meal—such as fruit crumbles or rice pudding. Simply not buying processed sweet or salty snacks and cakes will improve the whole family’s health.Everyone loves and hates different foods so of course your child will have their own individual preferences. For example, some children prefer dry foods; others love sauces. However, tastes change as time passes, so keep offering new foods in a casual way. The more familiar a food is, the more likely they are to try it. And be aware too that they may adore some foods that you hate!Don’t force them to eatEvery person needs the freedom to choose how much to eat, regardless of age. Nobody wants to be forced to clear the plate as many of us were expected to do as children. It can be tempting to watch your child’s every mouthful and to spoon food in just to satisfy yourself they have eaten what you think they need, but there is little to be gained by making mealtimes a power struggle. Whilst it can sometimes be wise to ask if a child has had enough to eat, never force or bribe them to eat more. Learning to ignore their body’s signals of fullness can put them at risk of obesity in the future. Try to relax and enjoy your own meal instead—perhaps we would all be healthier if we ate only until we were no longer hungry.Encouraging happy eatingMealtimes are an important part of family life. What’s more, they are the perfect opportunity for your toddler to see everyone enjoying sharing food and conversation and trying new dishes.Make eating and drinking a pleasant social time together. Sit at the table with your toddler for drinks and snacks and have something yourself. Children love to imitate others.• Allow your baby or toddler to feed themselves without pressure. Many picky eaters will eat more if they can feed themselves. This can also be helpful if you think your child overeats as it can slow down the process, giving their brain the chance to register signals of fullness.• Offer your toddler foods the family is eating or foods you have to hand.  Don’t invest lots of time and effort cooking something separately for them. They need to eat because he is hungry, not to please you.• Offer limited options if giving a choice. Too much to choose from can be overwhelming and unhelpful for a young child.• Avoid foods packaged specifically for children—they are expensive, may come in overly large portions and some are packed with sugar, salt, fat and other unnecessary ingredients. Limit juices and sugary drinks, which fill toddlers up without giving a wide range of nutrients. Offer water instead.• Offer small portions—they can always have more. If your child has snacked throughout the day they may not want to sit down and eat a full dinner. Young children need regular snacks and drinks but make sure those on offer are a balance of nutritious ones and bear this in mind when judging mealtime portion size.• Accept it when they say they have had enough and let them leave the table.• Avoid praising them for eating or describing food as ‘good for you’. Instead describe what you’re both eating: ”What a crunchy apple!” “What long spaghetti!’’• Try keeping foods separate from one another. Some children reject mixed foods if there is one taste or texture they don’t like.• Try involving children in food preparation, but be aware that some children may refuse to eat certain foods when they know what goes into them.Should I limit breastfeeds?Although you may want to offer your toddler solid foods before nursing, there’s no reason to stop breastfeeding altogether. Both mothers and children find the closeness and connection of breastfeeding an important reason for carrying on, and for taking weaning gradually. Breastmilk continues to be a nutritious, calorie dense food—as well as a drink. And it still helps protect him from infections, just as it did when he was tiny.Night waking?You may wonder if your night-waking toddler is hungry. Night-time can be an opportunity to catch up on nursing, away from distractions, especially if your days are busy or you are separated during the day. You could encourage more daytime nursing instead or offer a drink in a cup when they wake at night. If they believe nursing is the only way to fall asleep you can gently encourage other sleep associations. Or perhaps they need the security of being close to you when they wake in the dark? Many mothers still find nursing a little one back to sleep much easier than getting up and pacing the floor at night. It’s also quite normal for non-nursing toddlers to wake in the night needing a parent.Breastfeeding and obesityIt’s impossible simply to say ‘breastfeeding prevents obesity’. How a baby is breastfed and then introduced to solids may be as important, if not more so, than just receiving breastmilk. Babies who are allowed control over their own feeding patterns will consume only as much breastmilk as they need. They take in just the right amount of calories and set in place appropriate ‘appetite control’. The baby who is left to show signs of readiness for solid food and is able to choose from a range of healthy family foods what they eat and how much may be learning to control their appetite in a way that will help prevent obesity in later life.Nutritional needsBreastfed babies are often very good at moderating their own intake of food and drink to get what they need. Over the years researchers have found that, given the opportunity to select from a range of nutritious foods, toddlers balance their own intake, but over a period of weeks rather than days.Do they need cows’ milk?You may be told to give your toddler the equivalent of a pint of full fat cows’ milk a day to meet their calcium needs. Many nursing toddlers take this amount of breastmilk without their mothers realising it! You can offer cows’ milk and other dairy products but don’t be surprised if they’ve already had enough milk.What about iron?The iron in breastmilk is in a form that’s easy to absorb. But babies and children over six months should be offered (though not forced to eat) additional foods that are naturally rich in iron to ensure they get enough. The World Health Organization strongly recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. At six months, other foods should complement breastfeeding for up to two years or more.Change continuesThings are always changing where toddlers are concerned, so today’s fussy eater may quite easily become tomorrow’s gourmet. And once he becomes a teenager, he could be eating you out of house and home! Just as you trusted your breastfed baby to show you he had taken enough milk, you can trust that the toddler who is well, active and growing is getting what he needs, however little he eats. If you have concerns about your child’s eating, you may find it helpful to speak to an LLL Leader or go to an LLL meeting where you can meet other mothers who have been in your situation.Written by Sue Upstone & mothers of LLLGB.Further ReadingStarting Solid FoodStill Nursing?Thinking of Weaning?BooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Starting Solid Food,https://laleche.org.uk/starting-solid-food/,"Human milk is the perfect first foodIntroducing your baby to other foods is a big milestone, and can be fun too. The simplest approach is to continue your usual breastfeeding pattern and let your baby join you at family mealtimes. Your baby will be able to learn about new foods gradually and in their own time.Signs of readiness for complementary foodsBabies begin eating solid foods according to their own unique timetables, just as they will walk and talk when they are ready. Readiness to try new foods is just another developmental step and it isn’t necessary to do anything special.Babies show signs of readiness for complementary foods (to complement their milk intake) around the middle of the first year.Although previous research suggested that signs of readiness for starting solids were related to developmental changes which happen at around 4 months, recent research indicates the following signs of readiness:1Fact: Ability to sit up well when supportedOnce your baby can sit up well when supported (for at least a few minutes) let them join you at family mealtimes and allow them to pick up food.Fact: Loss of the tongue thrust reflexBabies who have not yet lost their tongue thrust reflex will push food out of their mouth with their tongue. The tongue thrust reflex is a sign that they are not developmentally ready for solid food.Fact: Ability to pick up food, put it in their mouth and chewA baby who is able to reach out and grab a piece of food, then bring it to their mouth and chew it is generally ready for solids. Research indicates that the ideal time to start solid food in terms of oral-motor developmental readiness is between six and eight months. As with other developmental stages, babies learn to chew when they are ready, not because solid food has been introduced by six months.Myth: Breastfeeding more oftenYour baby may ask to breastfeed more, yet still not be ready for solid food. They may just be unwell, having a growth spurt, teething, or reacting to stress. Offering your baby both breasts during each feed may be all that is needed.Myth: Waking at nightWaking at night is normal and common behaviour and is not a sign that a baby is ready to start other foods even if they have previously slept for longer periods.Myth: Watching you eatBabies are interested in and want to copy what they see around them, so watching others eat does not necessarily mean they are ready to start eating solid foods.Why follow your baby’s cues?Human milk is the most important food in your baby’s diet during their first year, providing them with most of the calories and fluids they need, as well as a wide range of nutrients. Allowing solids to replace breastmilk too quickly may lead to undernutrition, imbalance of nutrients, or poor weight gain. Breastfeeding continues to be a valuable source of nutrition and calories if your baby is unwell or teething, and doesn’t want to eat solid food.Breastfeeding provides your baby with antibodies, other immune factors, stem cells, and many other components unique to breastmilk. Breastfeeding alongside introducing solids helps to prevent harmful bacteria, such as E.coli, growing in your baby’s gut. Replacing your milk with solid food too early reduces the level of protection they receive.Developmental readiness inside and outYour baby’s digestive system gradually matures during the first six months. Introducing solids when  your baby is developmentally ready means they will be able to eat and digest these new foods.Preterm babies, babies with special needs or developmental delay may not be ready for solids until later than six months. Following their readiness signs will help you know when to offer solids. Speak to your baby’s healthcare team regarding their individual nutritional needs.Carry on breastfeedingStarting solid food is a new experience for your baby and is about taste, texture and learning new skills, not about replacing your milk. Babies are more likely to try something new if they aren’t too hungry – they may refuse solids when they really want to breastfeed. Remember that your baby isn’t likely to eat very much to start with.You may feel pressured into limiting breastfeeds so that your baby will take more solid food, but this can have the opposite effect. If your baby is happy and content after a breastfeed they may be more open to the idea of trying some new foods.Breastmilk gradually and gently introduces babies to the foods their mother eats because traces of those appear in her milk. This provides a variety of flavour experiences in a natural way, helping prepare the baby for the foods they will eat at the family table. Babies will want to eat whatever food is on the table, so this is a good opportunity to review the whole family’s diet.First tastesBaby–led weaningThe principle behind baby-led weaning is that babies will instinctively start to feed themselves when they are developmentally ready, given the opportunity. The skills to feed themselves and readiness of their body to process food occur naturally and do not need to be taught.Babies who are in control of feeding themselves (in contrast with spoon feeding) will only be able to pick up food, put it in their mouth and chew it when they are developmentally ready. This approach also lets babies determine which foods and how much they want to eat: they will naturally progress at their own pace and reduce breastfeeds when they are ready.Allowing babies to join in with family mealtimes will expose them to a wide variety of different foods, enable them to copy how other children and adults eat, and help make eating a pleasant experience, encouraging a positive lifelong relationship with food. A baby who is allowed free choice of good, nutritious foods tends to balance their own diet.For more information on baby-led weaning, see book Baby-led Weaning: The Essential Guide (2019).How to present food – shapes and sizesBabies love to use their hands, so offer foods that they can easily hold and put into their mouth. Until they have developed a pincer grip, babies can’t pick up small pieces of food. Offer sticks or pieces of food the shape/size of an adult’s finger. Most 6-month-old babies will be able to pick up the piece, hold it in their fist and gnaw the end sticking out of their fist.Softer foods can be spread on unsalted oat cakes, rice cakes or crackers, or dipped into with a suitable piece of food so your baby can manage by themselves. For tastes of soup, yoghurt or porridge, offer your baby a spoon with a small amount of food on, or let them dip their fingers in and lick off the food.Different tastes and texturesIt is important to offer your baby a wide variety of different foods as this will expose them to a range of tastes and textures. The ability to explore the different taste,  texture,colour and smell of food may help babies to have a healthier relationship with food.Aim to offer tastes of a wide variety of foods in as close to their natural state as possible. Given access to a range of food groups, your baby will show you what they need. If they don’t want a certain food, try something else, but do offer it again.You don’t need to purée foods or even mash them. Puréeing often requires liquid to be added, diluting the nutritional content. Solid (un-mashed) food aids development of chewing skills, which babies don’t get from sucking puréed food. Early exposure to different textures can also prevent a baby refusing to eat lumpy food later on.Gagging and chokingGagginghappens when food triggers a baby’s gag reflex and the food is pushed forwards to prevent it from blocking the airway. A baby gagging will usually be calm and breathing normally. Gagging is a natural protective mechanism to prevent choking and usually doesn’t need any intervention.Chokinghappens when a baby’s airway is (fully or partially) blocked and they can’t breathe. A baby choking will be coughing or silent (unable to make any noise), not breathing, and their face or lips may change colour. Choking is an emergency and they may need first aid to clear the blockage.Babies are less likely to choke on food if they are sitting upright and feeding themself. Research shows baby-led weaning is not associated with an increased risk of choking.2Certain foods are a choking risk for children under three years of age and should be avoided, including whole grapes, whole cherry tomatoes, popcorn, large amounts of peanut butter and any food that could break off in large chunks, such as raw carrot, hard apple or celery sticks. Nuts are a choking risk up to five years of age.At first, you may want to check your baby’s mouth for unswallowed food after a meal, including their cheeks and palate. Never leave your baby alone with food or when they are eating.Plan for a little mess!Solid foods are another part of the world your baby is exploring and they will do this as much by touch and smell as by taste. This can be messy, but is an important learning experience for them. To make cleaning up easier, roll up their sleeves, use a bib or apron and put a clean plastic cloth on the floor so you can safely re-offer dropped foods.Natural appetite controlIt is normal for your baby’s appetite to go up and down over the course of days, weeks and months. Don’t worry. Just offer more of any food they ask for and stop when they don’t want any more. There is no need to ‘top them up’ with a spoon if they haven’t eaten much at a meal. Allowing a baby to feed themselves and take their time over a meal helps them to tune in to their feelings of fullness and to stop eating, which is important throughout their life.If your baby refuses food, they are not rejecting you or your efforts. They may simply not be hungry. If they are ill or teething, unrestricted breastfeeding will ensure they receive good nutrition and will comfort them until they feel well and interested again.Allergy & Food IntoleranceCommon allergensThe most common allergens (in order of incidence) are:Milk and other dairy products such as butter, yoghurt, cheese, whey, casein, caseinate, lactoseEggPeanut and tree nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, etc.)SoyWheatFish and Shellfish: crustaceans (e.g. crab, lobster, crayfish, shrimp, prawn), molluscs (e.g. mussels, oysters, squid)Sesame seeds (in tahini and hummus)Lupin/lentils (including chickpeas which are in hummus)Fenugreek (closely related to peanuts)Celery and celeriacMustardIntroducing peanut and eggPeanut and hen’s egg are common allergens for babies. Current guidance recommends that foods containing peanut or hen’s egg need not be differentiated from other solid foods and can be introduced from around 6 months along with other foods.The deliberate exclusion of peanut or hen’s egg beyond 6 to 12 months of age may increase the risk of allergy to the same foods. Once introduced, and where tolerated, these foods should continue to be part of your child’s usual diet. If initial exposure is not continued as part of your child’s usual diet, then this may increase the risk of sensitisation and subsequent food allergy.3EczemaIf your baby has eczema, suspected food allergy, or a family history of food allergy you may wish to seek medical advice before introducing allergenic foods. If eczema is well-controlled (i.e. mild or cleared), it is easier to assess your baby’s tolerance to new foods.Offer allergenic foods in very small amounts and watch carefully for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. If eczema becomes difficult to manage after food introduction, stop the allergen and seek medical advice.Allergic reactions and symptoms to watch forIn very rare cases allergy can cause a severe life-threatening reaction called anaphylactic shock. If your baby has a severe and immediate allergic reaction, which may include swelling of the lips, tongue, eyes or face, seek emergency medical care.Food sensitivity reactions can include eczema, nettle rash (urticaria), a sore bottom, wheezing, asthma, colic, vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. If a food causes a mild reaction, talk to your health visitor or doctor about whether you should continue to give it. For further information, seeAllergies & Food Intolerances.Nutrition RequirementsVitamins and mineralsThe UK Department of Health recommend that all babies be given supplements including vitamins A, C and D from 6 months, and a vitamin D supplement from birth for breastfed babies and those receiving less than 500ml of formula per day.4IronA healthy full-term baby has sufficient iron stores at birth, and delayed cord clamping helps to increase a baby’s iron levels. Iron is present in human milk and bioavailable to the baby, which is sufficient for the first 6 months of a baby’s life. Introduce iron rich foods from six months such as meat, poultry, fish, egg, pulses/legumes (e.g. chickpeas and lentils) and fortified cereals.Vitamin DThis is produced when our bodies are exposed to sufficient sunlight. Wearing clothes and suncream to protect against skin cancer limits how much vitamin D we can produce. Vitamin D supplements are particularly important for babies who have limited exposure to sunlight and for babies with darker skin colour living in the UK. Breastmilk doesn’t contain high levels of vitamin D as, in the past, babies would absorb most of their vitamin D from exposure to sunlight.Vitamin B12This is found in animal protein. Your baby may need vitamin B12 supplements if you eat a strict vegetarian or vegan diet.5Nutritional needs of preterm babiesA premature baby does not have a good iron store at birth. If your baby was born before 34 weeks, they may already be receiving iron, zinc and vitamin supplements. Your preterm baby’s healthcare team will be able to give more specific guidance regarding their individual nutritional needs.Good First FoodsOffering your baby a wide variety of foods in as close to their natural state as possible will ensure they receive a range of nutrients. Highly processed, low-fat or ready-prepared adult foods are not suitable for babies. You don’t need to buy ready-prepared baby food. These foods are expensive, often come in over-large portions and may contain added ingredients your baby doesn’t need. If you choose to buy convenience foods, check labels carefully.To preserve nutrients as much as possible, bake, steam or cook foods in water. Take out a small portion for your baby before adding any salt or sugar to the rest. Allow it to cool to a suitable temperature. Offering finger foods avoids the need to add extras your baby may not be ready for, such as milk or butter.Note: Some foods can trigger allergic reactions in some babies. See further down this article for more information.FoodServing SuggestionNotesVegetables (e.g. carrot, pea,  sweet potato, potato)Cook lightly to soften if  needed. Give sticks or adult finger-sizedpieces.Remove skin if needed. Avoid small chunks of raw hard vegetables, such as carrots, which could cause choking.Fruit (e.g. apple, banana, avocado)Give your baby a whole fruit or large piece to hold.Remove skin and stones if needed. Small chunks can cause chokingPoultry (e.g. chicken)MeatGive large pieces of lean cooked meat, moisten with meat juices.Make sure to remove any  bones and gristle.FishPoach in a little water (no salt) or oven bake.Check carefully for bones.Fish can be allergenic so introduce it with caution. Don’t introduce shellfish, smoked fish or pickled fish until your baby is over 12 months.Rice cakesOat cakesCrackersSpread soft foods on, or use them for dipping.Plain, unsalted rice cakes, oat cakes and crackers are useful alternatives to rusks.BeansLentilsCooked beans and lentils canbe mashed to make a spread or dip.Cook all beans and lentils thoroughly.Dried fruitCut up larger fruits such asapricots. Apricots and prunescan be cooked in a smallamount of water to make anutritious spread.Although rich in nutrients, dried fruit can stick to teeth and if given frequently cancause tooth decay even if you clean your baby’s teeth regularly.Wholegrain cereals such as oats, corn (maize) and wheatCan be cooked with water, without salt, sugar or sweetener. Choose  unsweetened breakfast cereals.Most cereals contain a protein called gluten, a potential sensitizer, so avoid mixed-grain cereals until you know your baby can tolerate each one individually.BreadPastaRiceBread and pasta are easy finger foods. Serve pasta plain, with butter or grated cheese.Avoid pasta made with eggs until you know your baby can tolerate egg.Cottage cheese, yoghurt, fromage frais, butter, unprocessed cheeseYour baby can use a spoon ortheir fingers. Useful with cooked vegetables. Grate cheese or serve slices.Use unsalted butter.EggsCan be served scrambled,boiled, poached, in an omelette, etc.If lion-stamped, egg can be served raw. Otherwise, cook until both white and yolk are solid.Nuts and seeds (e.g. peanut butter, tahini)Should be spread thinly. Only use smooth varieties.Never give whole nuts or seeds until 5 years of age. Crunchy nut butter varieties can cause choking.Foods to avoidSaltcan overload a baby’s system and too much can cause kidney failure. Highly salted foods may foster a taste for salty foods. Avoid and minimize the use of processed  foods, packet mixes, crisps, savoury snacks, gravy and condiments such as ketchup, yeast extract, mustard and  brown sauce. When buying convenience foods look for low salt versions, including tinned beans and vegetables canned only in water.White sugarcontains virtually no nutrients and is a major factor in tooth decay. When checking food labels watch for other names for sugars – such as glucose, dextrose, sucrose, corn syrup and fructose.Molasses, maple syrup and honeyare also almost pure sugar and can displace healthy nutritious foods. Many processed foods which are advertised for babies have high sugar content and should be avoided, includingteething biscuitsandbaby rusks.Honeymay contain botulism spores and should not be given to babies younger than one year.Teething biscuitsare often high in sugar. Your baby can teethe using anything hard and safe to chew on, including unsalted rice cakes or crusty bread.Artificial sweetenersare present in many processed foods and drinks aimed at babies and children, includingjuice drinks, ready mealsandjars, andsnack foods. Children who eat food with artificial sweeteners may be more likely to develop a ‘sweet tooth’ and a preference for sweet food in later life.Artificial flavouringsandfood colouringare unnecessary chemicals.Foods high in saturated fats.While babies need fats in their diet, foods containing unnecessary saturated fats, such asfried foods, should be offered only in moderation.Very hot spicy food. Many babies like spicy food, but very hot spices, especiallychillies, may be unpleasant for a baby.Shark,swordfishandmarlinall contain high levels of mercury.DrinksWater, human milk and formula are the only recommended drinks until 1 year old.At mealtimes offer some plain tap water in a baby-sized (shot glass size) cup. You don’t need to use bottles or spouted cups but, if you do, a free flow cup is better than one with a non-spill valve on which a baby needs to bite to get the drink to flow.Avoid juices, sugary drinks and those with artificial sweeteners. Even unsweetened juices contain natural fruit sugars and acids that can damage teeth. They can leave no room for nutritious foods and it can be hard to limit them once you start them.Avoid giving bottled water, which may have high mineral levels, and drinks that contain caffeine. This includes fizzy and other soft drinks, tea and coffee.Can I offer cow’s milk as a drink?Cow’s milk is not suitable as a drink until after 12 months. Instead offer water, human milk or formula. However, you can use cow’s milk when cooking for your baby, for example in porridge and sauces. Other dairy products can be offered to your baby as a food e.g. cheese, yogurt, cream.After 1 year of age, cow’s milk can be given as a drink. Follow-on and toddler formulas are not necessary.Further ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. LLLI. London: Pinter & Martin, 2010.My Child Won’t Eat. González, C. MD.

Nursing Supplementers,https://laleche.org.uk/nursing-supplementers/,"If your baby needs a supplement of expressed breastmilk or formula, a nursing supplementer can help you enjoy the closeness of breastfeeding while your milk production increases.You can use a supplementer to:Stimulate breastmilk production while feeding infant formula or expressed mil, without using bottles.Breastfeed an adopted baby.Breastfeed as a non-birth parent.Maintain breastfeeding if your milk production isn’t able to meet your baby’s needs eg insufficient glandular tissue.Maintain breastfeeing if your milk production is compromised eg breast surgery or reduction.Encourage a baby who is reluctant to breastfeed.Breastfeed a baby who is unable to feed effectively because of sucking or health problems. However this will only work if you baby can feed well enough to obtain milk.How it worksHow to useAvailable productsDifferent supplementsHow to use a nursing supplementerCleaningEliminating supplementsSeek SupportHow it worksA nursing supplementer lets a baby get any supplement he needs at the breast without using bottles. The supplementer container holds the milk, which travels through a tube into your baby’s mouth while he breastfeeds. As he swallows, he continues sucking, stimulating your milk production.If you are breastfeeding expressing your milk, and giving top-ups to your baby, you may find it simpler to use a supplementer, which allows all the feeding to happen at the breast.A good latch-onIt’s especially important that your baby latches on deeply at the breast when you are using a supplementer. Get help withpositioning and attachmentso your baby can get milk from the breast as well as from the supplementer.Different supplementsExpressed breastmilkYour expressed breastmilk is the first choice for a supplement. If your baby has feeding difficulties, expressing will help you maintain and increase your milk production. To find our more about increasing your supply, see our articleHow to Increase Your Milk Supply. And for more information onExpressing Your Milkour article can help.Donor milkHuman milk banks provide pasteurized, screened donor milk.Infant formulaConcentrated and ready-to-feed forms of infant formula are less likely to clog nursing supplementer tubing than powdered forms. Although expensive, ready-to-feed formula may also be more convenient when you are out and about or at home without help. Powdered infant formula is not sterile, so always follow theNHS guidelinesfor preparing it.Available productsDisposable bag systemThis uses disposable sterile plastic bags with a top opening and a single tube. Milk only flows when a baby sucks and it is discreet to use as the bags are not bulky or noisy. You can also feed lying down without fear of leaks. When your baby sucks, the flow increases as the flow of milk from your breast decreases. This reinforces proper suckling, making the most of your milk production. (As in photograph above.)Bottle systemThis system uses a bottle with a tube for each breast, making switching sides easy or for twins. Each tube can be clamped. Three tube widths are available. Sets can be cleaned and reused. (As seen in the photograph below.)Homemade systemYou can make your own supplementer using an ordinary baby bottle, bottle teat and an infant nasogastric feeding tube (size #5 french, 52-75 length). Tubing can be obtained from online suppliers. (As seen in the first and last photos in this article.)Cut a small hole in the bottle teat so the tube fits tightly. Thread the tube through the teat from the inside and attach the teat normally so the end of the tube sits in the supplement. The tube end is rounded and won’t hurt your baby’s mouth. Pierce a second hole in the teat, or use a teat with a vent to allow air in so your baby won’t need to suck harder as the bottle empties. The bottle needs to stay upright. You may find tucking it into your bra keeps it in place.Photo courtesy of Michelle GreenHow to use a nursing supplementerIntroduce the tube into your baby’s mouth along with the breast at the very beginning of a breastfeed by placing it between your baby’s upper lip and cupped tongue. If your baby doesn’t like the feel of the tube on the roof of his mouth try placing it so it lies along his tongue. Or, slip the tube into the corner of your baby’s mouth once he is well-attached at the breast.You may need to extend the tube past the end of your nipple – experiment to see what works for your baby. The tube can be secured to your breast with medical tape. Taping along the tube is generally more secure than taping across it.To hold the tube in position some mothers use fabric sticking plasters cut from a long strip. They thread the tube under the non-sticky sections.The tube can be easily removed while the plasters stay in place, reducing skin irritation from tape removal and providing a guide for positioning each time.Milk flow – too fast or too slow?Constant milk flow can cause ineffective feeding as your baby will not need to actively suck to get milk. When using a supplementer you will see the milk travel along the tube to your baby’s mouth. Adjust the tube position and container height so your baby gets milk quickly when he starts sucking. Check he isn’t overwhelmed with milk, especially if he has heart or breathing difficulties or is premature.Slow down the flow of milk by lowering the milk container, raising the tubing or using thinner tubing. Or pinch the tube to slow or stop milk flow. If using the bottle system, stop milk flowing by clamping the tube in the slots in the bottle likd. To speed up milk flow, raise the bottle, use wider tubing or use two tubes at the same breast. You may need to adjust the tube in your baby’s mouth to create more suction.CleaningTo avoid having to throw away tubing when milk had dried inside, force cold water through the tube at least three times straight after use, using the bottle of a 5-10ml syringe. Using warm water may cause fat to cling to the sides of the tube.For commercial supplementers follow the manufacturers’ cleaning instructions. For homemade systems, follow the NHS guidance when cleaning the bottles and teats. Wash the tubing with hot soapy water, rinse with clean water and force air through the tube (or spin the tube fast) to dry. Take extra care if using infant formula. Store the clean supplementer parts in a sealed container in the fridge.Nasogastic tubes should not be boiled, steamed or chemically sterilised as they are not designed for multiple uses. If your baby is at a higher risk of infection, a commercial system may be a safer option than a homemade system. Replace the nasogastric tube when it starts to stiffen, after about a week.Eliminating supplementsThe use of infant formula is sometimes essential to meet a baby’s nutritional needs. You may need to use formula as a stopgap measure, while you work to increase your milk production. Supplementing with formula without protecting your milk supply may reduce the duration of your breastfeeding experience.Over time, you may be able to reduce the amount of supplement your baby needs as your milk production increases. Expressing in between feeds will signal to your breasts to make  more milk and give you some milk for the next feed. For more onIncreasing Your Milk Supply, see our article.Begin the feed with your baby taking milk just from the breast. When he is no longer swallowing regularly start the supplementer. If your baby is reluctant to nurse at all, start the milk flowing at the beginning of a feed to get him started.  As your breasts start to make more milk you will notice your baby takes less supplement, especially at certain times of day.For more information on managing and reducing supplements seeMy Baby Needs More MilkandRelactation and Induced Lactation.Seek supportWhether using a supplementer as a temporary or a long-term solution, support from your localLLL Leader and groupcan be a great help. For individual face-to-face help or a home visit, you could also consult a board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) or specialist breastfeeding clinic.Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone & mothers of LLLGB.

Still Nursing?,https://laleche.org.uk/still-nursing/,"Not so long ago you first held your tiny newborn and started on your breastfeeding journey together. Suddenly time has passed and you find yourself still breastfeeding an older baby or toddler – something you may never have envisaged doing! At this point you may wonder whether your child will end up ‘nursing forever’.For many mothers, it is other people’s expectations which are the problem. Almost as soon as breastfeeding is going well, people seem to start asking when you intend to stop! Coping with pressure from others to stop breastfeeding is not easy, but you will know in your heart what feels right for you and your child.Why nursing is still importantYour milk is still nutritiousAlthough you will be introducing your breastfed baby to the exciting world of solid foods from around 6 months of age, your milk will remain his most important food until at least 12 months. Beyond this, breastmilk is still a valuable contribution to your child’s diet, providing up to a third of both his daily calories and protein needs after 18 months, as well as being a good source of vitamins and minerals. Toddlers often eat varying amounts from day to day so it can be reassuring to know your child is still getting your milk.Protection from illnessBreastmilk continues to complement and boost your child’s immune system. Whilst breastfeeding is no guarantee that a toddler won’t become ill, it can help reduce the severity of any illness. When he is ill, breastmilk may be the only food or drink he can manage, especially during bouts of vomiting or diarrhoea. Nursing is also very comforting to a poorly toddler and can make it easier for you to cope with his illness. (See our articleAmazing Milk.)Comfort and securityNursing offers security at a time when your child is developing fast and the world seems a confusing place. A mother is often surprised at how important breastfeeding remains to her older baby or toddler.Breastfeeding beyond babyhood is normal‘Weaning’ is the process whereby a child learns to take nourishment other than his mother’s milk. It starts when the child is introduced to foods and drinks in addition to breastmilk, and endswhen he finally stops nursing. You may worry that if you don’t initiate an end to breastfeeding, your child will ‘nurse forever’.But children outgrow breastfeeding on their own, just as they outgrow other toddler behaviours. This process of ‘natural weaning’ can allow a child to develop at his own pace, giving up breastfeeding according to his own timetable. All children stop breastfeeding eventually, but some finish earlier than others. Rather than choosing a specific time to stop breastfeeding, many mothers just continue nursing while it’s working well for them and see how it goes.Mixed feelingsNot all mothers are comfortable or wish to breastfeed their babies beyond a certain point. Or perhaps you feel that your child is nursing too much, or more than you are comfortable with? Before rushing to wean, consider whether breastfeeding really does make your life harder. Your child will need your constant attention and care for years yet, whether he is breastfeeding or not. Sometimes needs can be met more simply and easily through nursing than in any other way.For many mothers, shortening feeds or reducing their frequency is enough to make them feel more positive about breastfeeding and confident that it will eventually end.Thinking Of Weaning?, How Breastfeeding Ends and the bookMothering Your Nursing Toddleroffer suggestions on how to reduce or end breastfeeding gently while still meeting your child’s needs. Your local LLL Leader will have suggestions, and other mothers in yourlocal LLL groupwill have found their own solutions too.Comments from othersYour biggest challenge may be coping with the opinions of others on how long you should continue to breastfeed and how weaning should happen. Explaining the importance of breastfeeding may seem threatening to people who made other choices. Instead, help them feel more comfortable by mentioning how breastfeeding makes life easier for you, your child and your family. You might say that you didn’t plan to nurse this long: “At first I planned to breastfeed him for six months. At six months I decided to wean him at a year.” Or, “Before he was born I hadn’t considered nursing a toddler!” Sometimes a smile and a witty response may do the trick: “When is he going to stop breastfeeding?”—“Oh, in about 5 minutes or so I expect!”Out and aboutCriticism can be easier to handle when you are happy and confident. Even so, you may start feeling uncomfortable about breastfeeding your older toddler in front of others. As a child develops theability to wait, some mothers set limits on where and when they nurse, or offer distractions at times when it’s inconvenient. You could nurse before you go out and take a healthy snack and drink to tide your toddler over until you reach the car, home or other suitable place. Selecting your own clothing carefully can help avoid accidental overexposure and choosing a convenient codeword for breastfeeding such as ‘num-nums’ or ‘milkie’ makes it less obvious when your child asks to nurse when out and about.Breastfeeding mannersSetting some gentle limits on how your older baby or toddler breastfeeds is the start of gentle discipline and guiding him into good behaviour. It starts when you hold his hand or give him a toy to stop twiddling while feeding. If your toddler tries to breastfeed in unusual or uncomfortable acrobatic positions, you can let him know that it hurts and that if he wants to nurse he needs to sit properly. It’s best to start to set limits on how you will breastfeed before behaviour becomes a problem. If a behaviour you aren’t happy with has become a habit, it may take a little perseverance to change things. But even young toddlers respond to consistent loving guidance, especially if rewarded with breastfeeding and a thank you when they behave appropriately.Conflicting adviceSome people, even health professionals, who are unfamiliar with breastfeeding an older baby or toddler, may claim that nursing beyond a certain age leads to spoiling, tooth decay, obesity or any number of other consequences! There is no evidence for this. A child’s secure attachment actually leads to independence.There is evidence that tooth decay is dependent on the presence of certain oral bacteria and enamel defects. Limiting sugary foods (including dried fruit), drinks and sweets, and careful cleaning are better preventions than ending breastfeeding. There is also evidence that obesity is more prevalent in children who are not breastfed.Children all develop at different rates: crawling, walking and talking at different ages. Why should weaning be any different? Children’s needs for sucking and closeness vary. If your child enjoys breastfeeding and it makes him feel good, what a great reason for snuggling up with himBenefits for youBreastfeeding helps:• Calm an overtired or fussy child.• Soothe you both if your child is hurt or in pain.• Ease frustration and recovery from toddler tantrums. While clingy, demanding behaviour is normal in young children, some families find that when breastfeeding continues, the ‘terrible twos’ turn into ‘terrific twos’.• You stay calmer and drift back to sleep more easily, thanks to those breastfeeding hormones.• Reduce your risk of developing breast cancerThinking of weaning?If you are thinking of taking active steps to end breastfeeding there are lots of suggestions inThinking of Weaning?and How Breastfeeding Ends. The ‘don’t offer, don’t refuse’ method can be a helpful approach after the first year. Simply continue meeting your toddler’s need to nurse if he is hurt, tired or upset and wait until he asks when his need is less obvious. Offer a healthy snack, drink or a story instead—and see how he reacts. Encouraging your child to help you around the house and get involved in play can provide natural distractions when he doesn’t really need to nurse. Setting appropriate limits is the start of gentle discipline and can be a way of saving your breastfeeding relationship. How long your toddler is able to wait will depend on the situation, his age and temperament. Do make sure that you follow through and offer the promised feed later, so he trusts you and is willing to wait.Wanting another babyRegular periods generally signal the return of fertility. Whilst some mothers who aren’t using contraception become pregnant while nursing a toddler, others don’t become pregnant until after breastfeeding ends. Every mother responds differently to the stimulus of breastfeeding and there are no easy answers. Some mothers try partial weaning in the hope of getting pregnant, but many simply wait knowing that, with time, the breastfeeding relationship will become less intense and fertility will return.PregnancyPregnant nursing motherssometimes receive conflicting advice about whether to wean. Some mothers find their child weans naturally during the pregnancy. Other mothers continue to breastfeed during pregnancy and may go on to feed both children. This is called tandem nursing. See Further Reading for more information.Finding supportIt is easy to feel isolated when the reality of life with a baby or toddler does not meet your expectations. Being able to meet other mothers in similar situations can be a great help. La Leche League groups welcome mothers at any stage of breastfeeding, so you will often find mothers breastfeeding older babies and toddlers at your local group meeting. Some LLL groups run toddler meetings where you can share experiences and tips.Feelings, needs and expectationsYour own feelingsHowever you feel, do take care of yourself so you can enjoy caring for your child. Avoid making quick decisions to wean. A break, a nap, a bath, or just something to eat or drink, may be all you need to recharge before deciding what you want to do. Breastfeeding is a two-way relationship, and your needs are important too. You can adjust your approach as situations change. It isn’t easy when you are ready to stop breastfeeding, and your baby isn’t. To help your child move on, try to end breastfeeding gradually and with love while giving him your time and attention in other ways. Encouragement and support are always helpful when our children are moving on in life, from toddlerhood to teenage years.An intense need for mumA baby has an intense need to be with his mother that is as important as his need for food. Breastfeeding is not just food—it helps your toddler maintain the close attachment to you that has been his security up until now. The security of a baby’s bond with his mother is the basis for all other relationships and will help him to become more independent as he grows and develops.There are many reasons why children need extra reassurance from nursing. Many little ones want to nurse only occasionally, perhaps for going to sleep and if they hurt themselves. But if your child seems to breastfeed avidly, it can help to look at what is happening in his life and yours. Perhaps he spends time away from you or particular demands on your time and attention take you away from him, such as other children, the telephone, the Internet or your job. Are you meeting his needs for attention, conversation and playmates, in addition to snacks and drinks, before he asks to nurse? You too may have got used to thinking that nursing meets every need. As they get older, children crave your focused attention as well. Sometimes nursing replaces other important contact: playing, exploring the great outdoors and taking part in household tasks.If you need to be apart at times, his need for closeness may be more intense than ever when you are together. Satisfying this need will help equip your child for times when you are away. Many older children enjoy spending time with dad and only ask to nurse when mum is around. Young children often pick up on any emotional stress in the family, or changes such as moving house. Major growth and development milestones, illness or allergies could also be factors that influence his need for you. If you are feeling uncertain or worried about limiting nursing, you may find your child becomes anxious and asks to nurse more frequently. On the other hand, if you are confident about your decision and able to give of yourself lovingly in other ways, weaning is likely to go more smoothly.Dad’s feelingsPerhaps your partner isn’t comfortable with his child continuing to breastfeed now that he is older. He may feel his toddler is too dependent on you, or that breastfeeding is only for babies. In your eyes your child is still your babywhilst others see him or her as a big boy or girl who can walk and talk. It can help to share your feelings honestly with your partner and listen carefully to how he feels. He might find talking to another dad whose child nursed longer, or meeting a confident independent child who breastfed for a long time helps ease his concerns.ExpectationsSometimes our expectations simply don’t fit with the needs of our individual children. While our society often expects babies to be weaned from the breast within a year, no one seems to question that many two and three year olds still suck on bottles, thumbs, or dummies, or need a comfort object. If you meet your child’s need for closeness and security the need will be fulfilled, allowing him to grow and move on at his own pace. Even the clingiest toddlers have grown into independent, adventurous adults.All children are different, but Ruth’s story shows how allowing a child to enjoy the nursing relationship and develop at his own pace pays dividends in the end:“I know that some people look at a small boy climbing on his mum’s knee to nurse, hiding his face shyly in mum’s shoulder, or perhaps insisting on climbing into the family bed rather than his own, and worry that this little chap will grow up to be a ‘mummy’s boy’.If anyone you know has expressed such concerns, you might like to let him know about my son Michael. He nursed until he was four, preferred to stay home and not go to playgroup until he was four and a quarter, and frequented the family bed for a quite a while. But at the age of eighteen Michael completed his RAF Regiment training, a very physically demanding course. Only eight of the original thirty-one recruits got through. Now a Corporal, Michael is a confident, mature and very caring young man.”Written by Karen Butler, Sue Upstone and mothers of LLLGB.‘Breastfeeding on the Tube’ – photo courtesy Brendan WilliamsFurther ReadingAdventures in Gentle Discipline Flower, H.

Birth & Breastfeeding,https://laleche.org.uk/birth-breastfeeding/,"Whatever your birth options, your active participation is a big help in getting breastfeeding off to a good start. Making informed choices about where and how you give birth is the first step.Even when medical concerns limit your choices, there may be more options available than your medical team shares with you. Take time to do research and discuss your preferences and choices with your birth partner. If you find you can’t give birth in your preferred place, you can still follow the suggestions on this page for helping birth go well.Birth optionsLabourLabour interventionsBirth interventionsThe first 24 hoursIf your baby needs special careEarly daysIt’s never too late to breastfeedBirth optionsConsider a birthing place where you can participate actively, whether you are having a vaginal or caesarean birth. Options may include giving birth in hospital, at home or at a birthing centre. Your choice may affect which midwifery team(s) care for you during pregnancy and labour. Think about giving birth supported by caring people you feel comfortable with. Follow your instincts to find a place where you can feel safe and private during and afterwards. If you feel stressed in labour, your body naturally produces ‘fight-or-flight’ hormones that may slow down labour and delay birth. If you feel in control, you are less likely to need unnecessary birth interventions that can affect breastfeeding.Questions to askWhich midwifery team(s) will be looking after me during my labour?Will I be able to get to know the midwives beforehand?Are options such as a low-tech birthing room or birth pool available, and how often are they used?If I give birth at home or in a birthing centre, what will happen if I need to move to hospital?Do the staff encourage labour in a variety of positions—for example, walking, standing, kneeling, kneeling while leaning forwards and holding on to something, or being on all-fours?Will I be encouraged to hold my baby in skin-to-skin contact as soon as he is born and to continue to hold him afterwards as often and as long as I want?HospitalsA hospital that is a certified UNICEF Baby Friendly Hospital, or is working towards certification, will be implementing the UNICEFTen Steps to Successful Breastfeeding programme. It’s a good idea to plan a hospital visit before making up your mind.  The websitewww.birthchoiceuk.comalso has information on options, including statistics on caesarean section rates. According to The World Health Organisation, caesarean rates of more than 15% do not make birth safer.Who will support you? In addition to a midwife, many mothers choose to have their partner, friend or other family member as a birth companion. Some mothers employ a doula too. A doula is a trained, non-medical labour-support person who can support you and your partner at home during labour, in hospital and in the days after the birth.Photo courtesy of Kimberly Seals AllersLabourIt can help to think of labour as ‘work’, with each contraction bringing you nearer the birth. After spending nine months keeping your baby nourished and nurtured in your womb, your cervix has to change tactics and open up for the birth. You’ll feel your muscles working hard with the unfamiliar exercise. Most mothers can ease into an unmedicated labour which often has a wave-like natural rhythm. Breathing and relaxation techniques can be a very effective way of coping with the ebb and flow of contractions.Ways to help labour go wellPreparation: talking to other mothers, reading and attending antenatal birth classes will help you feel more ready. Write down your birth preferences and discuss them with your midwife. But be prepared to go with the flow if your circumstances or feelings change. If you have older children make sure you have organized someone to care for them, wherever you plan to give birth.Read about LLLGB’s Antenatal Breastfeeding Classeshere.Privacy: consider who you want around you during labour, and ask those supporting you to protect you from unwelcome visitors. In hospital, create your own privacy by treating the room as your space. Keep the door closed, bring your favourite music, your own pillow and wear your own clothes if possible.Eat and drink when you feel like it, especially in the early stages of labour. This gives you more energy to manage your contractions, the birth and those amazing first hours after your baby arrives. Prepare for it to take time: labour gradually develops from the normal Braxton-Hicks ‘warm-up’ contractions of your uterus, into stronger contractions that usually become painful and harder to ignore. Some women find contractions stop and start over a period of days or even weeks.Every labour is different, even if you’ve had a baby before. As labour progresses you’ll probably become more inwardly focused, concentrating on the work you are doing and less inclined to chat to the people around you. Your body will release natural pain-relieving endorphins. Towards the end you will feel like pushing.Listen to your body: move around and change position when you are uncomfortable or if labour doesn’t seem to be progressing. Follow your body’s urges; lie on your side and rest if you feel tired; wander about or go outside for a walk if you feel like it. You’re not ill—and you don’t have to labour or give birth in bed. Lying on your back during labour generally delays birth and makes it all harder. It might also mean you need more pain relief medication which can interfere with breastfeeding.Cutting the cord only after it has stopped pulsating reduces your baby’s risk of anaemia in the first year of life.Labour interventionsKnowing beforehand about possible interventions will help you to ask questions and decide whether to accept what you are offered. You might want to discuss these possibilities with your midwife. However, in the unlikely event of an emergency, medical staff will need to take action quickly to ensure the safety of you and your baby but they will tell you what is happening.InductionWhat can happen:the drug syntocinon (artificial oxytocin) is used to induce or speed up labour. It produces stronger, and possibly more painful contractions than your own naturally produced oxytocin. This often leads to further interventions, such as pain relief medication, an assisted delivery or a caesarean section.What you can do:avoid routine induction if you and your baby are healthy. Consider whether there is a family history of ‘overdue’ babies. Review your dates, weigh up the risks and talk to your midwife about waiting a little longer to see if labour will start naturally. Some believe that having sex can help you go into labour.MedicationsWhat can happen:pethidine, epidural anaesthetics etc cross the placenta into your baby’s bloodstream.He may feel groggy and have difficulty coordinating latching on and sucking at the breast for up to two weeks after the birth.What you can do:Using non-medical pain relief such as water, massage, moving around and TENS can reduce your need for medical pain relief. If your baby is affected by medications, keep him in skin-to-skin contact as much as possible, even when he’s asleep. UseBiological Nurturing™laid back breastfeeding positions so you can watch for baby feeding reflex cues like mouthing movements, lip twitches or sucking whilst asleep and help him take the breast. Until they are feeding well, frequently express drops of your colostrum directly into their mouth.Intravenous (IV) dripsWhat can happen:IV drips are used for certain induced births and caesarean births. Fluid from IV drips may cause engorgement in the early days. This makes it difficult for your baby to latch on deeply at the breast and may lead to nipple damage. Their birth weight may also be higher from any excess fluid which they then lose in the first few days.What you can do:A few hours delay in weighing your baby may give a more realistic birth weight. Frequent feeds will help you avoid or reduce engorgement as your milk volume increases. To relieveengorgement, soften your breast by gently pressing swelling away from the nipple with your fingers (a technique known as reverse pressure softening). You can also hand express some milk.Birth interventionsEpisiotomy and assisted delivery with forceps or ventouseWhat can happen:cuts and tears that need stitches may make sitting upright uncomfortable in the days after birth. Forceps or ventouse delivery can also leave your baby feeling sore, bruised and with a headache.What you can do: move around in labour and choose your own positions for the birth: kneeling while leaning forward, being on all-fours etc. When breastfeeding, use Biological Nurturing™ positions to get comfortable and to help your baby recover. These and side-lying positions also limit pressure on your baby’s head.Caesarean sectionWhat can happen:a caesarean is major abdominal surgery. You will take at least six weeks to recover from the birth and need help looking after your baby. Your baby may be affected by the anaesthetic (epidural or general) and be less able to feed well at the breast for the first few days.What you can do:Insist on skin-to-skin contact with your baby as soon as he is born. You could write this in your birth preferences beforehand, just in case. If a general anaesthetic is required, a family member can be present and hold your baby skin to-skin until you are able to, and help you hold him if you’re feeling shaky. Avoid any routine bottles—your baby can wait a short time for you. If possible reading our pages oncaesarean birthandantenatal expression of colostrumbefore you go into labour. Biological Nurturing™ and side-lying positions can help you get comfortable whilst breastfeeding. Or try an underarm rugby hold.Syntometrine injectionWhat can happen:once your baby is born, the placenta separates from the uterine wall. A routine syntometrine injection may be offered to assist this as many believe that this injection reduces the risk of excessive bleeding. Following a normal birth, few mothers need the injection. Side effects of syntometrine can include nausea or a headache, which may affect the early hours you spend with your baby.What you can do:discuss this intervention with your midwife when writing your birth preferences. Keep warm and undisturbed. Skin-to-skin contact with your baby and breastfeeding immediately after birth encourages oxytocin production. Oxytocin contracts your uterus so your placenta is expelled naturally.SeparationSometimes and for various reasons you may be separated from your baby following birth. Plan to be in close body contact with your baby as soon as possible as this is the best way to establish breastfeeding. Separation because of health concerns may make breastfeeding harder, but it’s still possible.Hold, or at least touch, your baby immediately after the birth or as soon as you can. Once you are together again make up for lost time by spending as much time as possible snuggling together skin-to-skin or lightly dressed. If your baby is in special care you can still touch and stroke him and may be able to hold him against you in ‘kangaroo mother care’ for long periods of time. And if he can’t feed at the breast straight away thenexpressingyour milk for him is important. Many mothers say that this is the single most important thing they have done while they are waiting to start breastfeeding.The first 24 hoursYour newborn baby already knows your voice and smell—and you are their whole world. He needs to be in continuous close contact with you and to have your milk as soon as he is ready. Breastfeeding is known asthe fourth stage of birth.Lean back with your baby snuggled up against you, skin-to-skin, in full body contact.Avoid interruptions until after they have had their first breastfeed. Weighing and washing need to wait—this is much more important. Watch as he nuzzles your body and uses their legs to push himself to your breast. They may turn their mouth towards your breast—the rooting reflex. Their head may bob around as he tries to latch on or he may just lick for a while. They may take a look around at their new surroundings. But sometime soon they’ll probably take a big mouthful of breast. They may feed for quite a while or they may take a few sucks and fall asleep, waking on and off, sucking and feeding whilst asleep.Your baby’s instinctive feeding responses work when he is asleep too and will help him find the breast, latch, suck and drink. Your body will respond by releasing prolactin and oxytocin, the hormones that make and release milk. These hormones also help you bond with your baby making mothering easier and more natural.Some babies will feed on and off for an hour or two, others more continuously for a shorter time. Keep your baby on your body or close by while he sleeps so you’ll notice when he is ready to feed. A young baby’s sleep cycle lasts about 60–90 minutes. Transitioning from light to deep sleep may be hard for him and it helps to hold him as he goes into deep sleep.And so to sleepIf your baby has an enjoyable feed just after birth, they may sleep for up to six hours. This gives you time to rest and eat. Hold your baby as much as you want—ideally skin-to-skin wearing just a nappy and a blanket over their back to keep him warm.If a baby is wrapped and put down, they won’t be reminded to rouse and feed. If you think they need a feed you don’t need to wake them. With them snuggled against you it’s easy to gently encourage them to latch on while they are in a light (REM) sleep. Watch for rapid eye movements under their closed eyelids, arm and leg movements, sucking activity and changes in their facial expression and then encourage them to latch on.If your baby doesn’t feed within an hour of the birth, they may sleep deeply. Keep them skin-to-skin with you and drip expressed colostrum into their mouth every hour or two until they are ready to latch on.If your baby doesn’t feed frequently over the next few days, hand express colostrum and drip it into their mouth every couple of hours, including at least once between midnight and 5am to boost your milk producing hormones. When your baby is awake, you will probably want to gaze intently at each other and enjoy getting to know one another. Read the section onWakeful Nightsfor more on sleep.If your baby needs special careYou are still the most important person to your baby. They will recognise your voice and smell and they need your milk as soon as they can take food. Breastmilk protects a baby from NEC (gut damage) and other illnesses so ask staff to show you how to hand express. If you are well, start hand expressing within six hours of the birth; if you are unwell, as soon as you feel able.Until your baby is able to breastfeed:Express milk 8–10 times in 24 hours to build your milk supply, including once during the night. You can switch to using a pump as your milk increases. Talk to your baby and touch them as much as possible. Ask staff when you can start skin-to-skin contact with them. This helps your milk production and your milk ejection reflex (let-down). It also calms and stabilises your baby and feels wonderful.Early DaysDay 2Give your baby plenty of chances to learn to breastfeed by holding them in skin-to-skin contact most of the time. You can wear a gown or loose pyjama top and wrap it round them, or cover them with a blanket. Expect your baby to feed 8 to 12 times in 24 hours, including night feeds. Relax and enjoy these special hours together.Days 3 to 5Your colostrum will start to change from golden to bluish-white as you produce more milk. Your breasts will start to feel full, even engorged or sore, making it harder for your baby to latch on well. They need to get a deep latch so feeding won’t make your nipples sore, so: breastfeed (or express) frequently. If your breasts feel softer and more comfortable after feeding, your baby is getting milk.Avoid using bottles or dummies. If a supplement is needed try using a spoon, flexible feeding cup or syringe. Use a cold compress for 15–20 minutes between feeds to reduce swelling, or place cold cabbage leaves inside your bra. Apply moist warmth to your breasts for up to two minutes just before feeding to help your milk flow.Problems with feedingIf your baby is sleepy from a difficult birth or medications used, they may not feed well. You can drip hand expressed colostrum directly into their mouth or give it to them by cup, spoon or syringe. As you produce more milk, you can use a pump until your baby is feeding well. Ask for help to get breastfeeding established. When they latch on, it should feel comfortable for you (after the first few sucks).If your baby is finding it hard to latch onWhen your baby bobs their head and licks the nipple, it naturally makes it easier to latch on. Reverse pressure softening has a similar effect by moving fluid away from the nipple area: press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple.Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola. You can also press with the sides of fingers. Place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be.Falling hormonal levels after the birth can make you feel emotional, upset or weepy. This is absolutely normal and typically lasts just a few days.JaundiceJaundice is common and normal in newborns. Getting breastfeeding off to a good start can prevent it becoming a problem which needs treatment. If your baby has jaundice, frequent breastfeeding and/or expressed breastmilk will help clear the yellow bilirubin pigment. If further treatment is needed, our pageJaundice in Healthy Newbornshas more information.Wakeful nightsWhile your baby is small, you will find some nights are particularly wakeful, including the second night just before your milk ‘comes in’. Your baby may want to feed very frequently, doze off and then wake again, protesting if put down.Keep your baby close so they can feel your presence and hear your heartbeat, just as in the womb. Let them breastfeed frequently—it will boost your milk production.If you need to put them down to sleep, wait until they fall into a deep sleep. You could cover them with a sheet or blanket while feeding, then lay them down on the cover to avoid contact with a cool surface.Avoid using mittens—their hands are familiar and soothing, mittens feel strange. And the touch of their skin on your breast boosts oxytocin and your milk.It’s never too late to try breastfeedingIf your birth is more difficult than anticipated, you and your baby have problems or are separated for any reason after the birth it may take you both a little longer to feel closely connected and get breastfeeding going well.If this happens to you, keep your baby with you. Decline offers from others to look after him—ask them to do something practical to help you instead. Relax together with your baby snuggled up against you in Biological Nurturing™ laid-back breastfeeding positions, either lightly dressed or in skin-to-skin contact. Spend as much time as possible with their whole body against yours.Take a warm bath together and focus on just admiring him. Breathe in their special smell, nuzzle and kiss him—some mothers even get an urge to lick their babies. All these can encourage your baby’s natural instinct to feed and help you feel more motherly and that you belong together.How often will my baby need to feed?Babies have tiny tummies so they can’t wait long for food. Even adults rarely go longer than a couple of hours without a drink, snack or meal. Breastmilk is quickly digested so in the early weeks a baby needs to nurse pretty constantly— at least 8–12 times in a 24-hour period, including feeds at night. You release more of the milk-making hormone prolactin during night feeds. Late afternoon/ evening feeds are often closer together too. This ‘cluster feeding’ is normal.As your breasts adjust, they will feel softer. It doesn’t mean your milk supply has dropped. From Day 3 onwards 3–5 poos (at least the size of a 2p coin) per 24- hours are reassuring signs. Frequent feeds are a gradual transition from continuous feeding in the womb. Hunger is a new sensation for your baby so try not to make him wait until he’s too desperate to feed well.Watch for:Mouth movements, including smacking or licking their lips.Sucking on lips, tongue, hands, fingers, toes, toys, or clothing.Rooting, head bobbing or nuzzling against whoever is holding them.Fidgeting or squirming a lot.Fussing.CryingCrying is nature’s emergency siren and a late sign of hunger. It’s designed to summon help quickly. As well as being stressful for you it’s stressful for your baby. Crying raises cortisol levels (which can affect brain development) and increases your baby’s blood pressure. Life will be happier for everyone if you can respond quickly. Once you get to know your baby better you’ll be able to work out what they need most of the time as soon as they start to fuss, long before they need to cry. And thye’ll learn to relax knowing that you’ll look after them.Sucking patternsWatch your baby’s pattern of sucking. They will suck rapidly until milk starts to flow. Once the milk is flowing you’ll see a pattern of suck–swallow–suck–swallow. The frequency of sucks gradually slows as the feed progresses.Once swallowing movements start to trail away and your baby relaxes and gets sleepy, it can be useful to change sides. This can prompt them to take some more.Getting restMany mums feed lying down in bed at night (or in the day) to get more rest. Research shows that keeping your baby close while they are asleep protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) but you should never sleep on a sofa or chair with your baby. Do not share a bed with your baby if any adult in the bed smokes, has drunk alcohol or taken prescription or other drugs. Talk to anLLL Leaderand read our pageSafe Sleep & the Breastfed Babyas you decide how best to manage night-times.VisitorsIt’s OK to set limits on visiting—in fact it’s a really good idea. The first few days are a very special chance for you and your partner to get to know your baby peacefully together. If the birth was difficult it may help to write down your birth story or talk to someone about your feelings to help you come to terms with how it all happened.SupportNo matter how birth goes, with good friends and support, most mothers and babies breastfeed.Calling an LLL Leader or going to yourlocal LLL Groupwhile pregnant means you’ll make breastfeeding friends and have access to support and information right from the start. If you have problems in the first week, or if your baby isn’t feeding well, seek help as soon as possible.As well as your midwife or health visitor, you can contact anLLL Leader.You can also find lots of information on common concerns in the first weeks in our Further Reading section.Written by Rachel O’Leary, Sue Upstone, Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGB.Kimberly Seals Allers’ photos on this site are used under a creative commons license ofBlack Breastfeeding 360°http://mochamanual.com/bb/Further ReadingAdjusting to MotherhoodCaesarean Birth & BreastfeedingPositioning & attachmentComfortable BreastfeedingEngorged Breasts – Avoiding & TreatingIs My Baby Getting Enough Milk?My Baby Won’t BreastfeedJaundice in Healthy NewbornsSafe Sleep & the Breastfed BabySleepy Baby – Why & What To DoSuccessfully breastfeeding your premature babyWhat’s the Big Deal With Skin-to-SkinMothering through special careOther websiteswww.birthchoiceuk.comwww.biologicalnurturing.comwww.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendlyBooksThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, LLLI.

Nipple Confusion,https://laleche.org.uk/nipple-confusion/,"‘Nipple confusion’, ‘nipple preference’ or ‘flow preference’ is often used to describe a change in a baby’s sucking pattern or their willingness to breastfeed following the introduction of a bottle or dummy. A baby may have difficulty latching or staying on the breast, be fussy or reluctant to breastfeed, or be unable to remove milk effectively.Babies are ‘hard-wired’ to breastfeed, so it’s almost always possible to get back to breastfeeding using one or more of the following strategies. Your role is to calm your baby, give them access to the breast, and follow their cues. It’s your baby’s job to feed.Helping baby nurseBreast compressionsNipple ShieldsA deeper latchReturning to workHelping baby nurseClose contact and skin to skinFull body contact with your baby, particularly skin to skin, can trigger your baby’s instinct to breastfeed and help them get a deeper latch.Laid back breastfeedingAs you recline, place your baby upon you so that their whole front is against you and they are supported by your body. Spend as much time like this as you can, skin to skin if possible. For more information, see our article onPositioning and Attachmentfor more information on laid back breastfeeding.Make the breast a “safe space”Handle your baby gently when at the breast to help them associate your breasts with pleasure. Make yourself comfortable, try to take the pressure off breastfeeding and concentrate on bonding and cuddles.Offer the breast earlyWatch for early feeding cues – head bobbing or sucking motions – so that your baby is not too hungry when you offer the breast. Pushing them onto the breast when they are upset may make things worse. Allow your baby to take the breast at their own pace to help them relax and feel in control.A faster flowSwallowing encourages sucking, which will help keep milk flowing. A baby who has become used to a continuous fast flow from a bottle may need help to persist at the breast. You could hand express so that milk starts flowing as soon as your baby latches. Use breast compression to increase milk flow then switch sides to trigger a fresh letdown and encourage them to continue feeding.Breast compressionsCup your hand around your breast, fingers on one side, thumb on the other.When your baby’s swallowing slows, or to increase milk flow, compress your breast firmly. Hold it squeezed whilst they continue to swallow.Release, rotate your hand and repeat. Once you have compressed all areas of the breast, switch sides to stimulate further letdowns. You can switch several times each feed.Nipple ShieldsIf improving attachment and increasing milk flow are not enough, a nipple shield may help provide something firmer for your baby to latch on to. A nipple shield is a thin, silicone teat that can be placed over a mother’s nipple during breastfeeding with holes in the tip to allow milk to flow into the baby’s mouth.A nipple shield can be a useful tool in some situations. It is then regarded as a temporary solution – a transition towards breastfeeding without shields.Nipple shields come in different sizes – a comfortable fit is very important. A good latch is essential with a nipple shield to make sure your baby gets plenty of milk. If your baby latches onto just the tip, they may compress your nipple causing pain.See our article onNipple Shieldsor contact an LLL Leader for more information on using nipple shields effectively.When your baby is sleepyYour baby may take the breast and start sucking when they are asleep or sleepy. It can help to sleep close to your baby so you can easily offer the breast during the night.Other ideasTaking a bath together may encourage your baby to relax, latch and feed well. You’ll need help to do this safely. Motion can help. Offer the breast while carrying your baby in a sling, standing up, walking around, or swaying.A deeper latchOften, an adjustment to the way you position your baby can help them achieve a deeper latch with a wider open mouth. This is especially important as your baby grows heavier and longer. Talk to an LLL Leader for personalised suggestions.Relax comfortably with your breast in its natural position. Bring baby to breast, not breast to baby. Reclining positions make this easier because your body supports your baby.Align your baby ‘nose to nipple’ so their mouth is in the right place to latch when they tip their head back.Pull your baby’s whole body close against yours, from their chest to their hips. It may help to tuck their bottom under your arm.Make sure their head is free to tip back so they can comfortably open their mouth wide.Skin to skin contact can also help your baby tune in to their natural feeding reflexes.For more information, see articlesComfortable BreastfeedingandPositioning & Attachment, and the Natural Breastfeeding video in Further Reading.Bottles and dummiesWait until breastfeeding is established to introduce an artificial teat. Using artificial teats (bottles and dummies) in the early days is more likely to cause your baby to have a shallow latch at the breast, so delay introducing these until breastfeeding is going well.Avoid fast flow from a bottleA baby who gets used to a rapid flow of milk from a bottle without much effort can show a preference for the bottle over time. It is perfectly possible to breastfeed without ever using bottles, but if you do use a bottle ‘pace’ the bottle feeds to slow the flow of milk. SeeBottles and other toolsfor more information on paced bottle feeding.Alternatives to bottlesIf your baby is unable to feed at the breast or needs a supplement, you don’t need to use a bottle. Depending on how much supplement is required, you can use a spoon, syringe, cup or nursing supplementer (this provides extra milk while your baby nurses). SeeBottles and other toolsand alsoNursing Supplementers.Returning to workIf you plan to give your baby a bottle when you return to work, wait until shortly before. Your baby may accept a bottle early on but refuse it later. If your baby will be older than six months a cup can be used instead.Dummies (soothers/pacifiers)Nursing provides comfort for babies which is important for their development. Frequent dummy use, especially in the early weeks, may impact your milk production and your baby’s weight gain.Dummies(unlike some bottles) usually have a short teat which means babies have a partially closed mouth when sucking. If a baby uses this mouth position often, they may not open their mouth wide enough when feeding at the breast.Nursing strike?When an older baby or toddler suddenly refuses to breastfeed it is known as a nursing strike. Sometimes overuse of bottles and teats can contribute to the problem, but often this is due to discomfort while nursing, teething, illness, or an unpleasant experience that your baby associates with nursing. SeeNursing Strikesfor more information.Time and patience may be neededA baby’s behaviour can change suddenly, especially in response to gentle repetition, even if it doesn’t seem to be working at first. With time, most babies will breastfeed again. In the meantime, express your milk to maintain supply.Maintaining milk productionExpress your milk if your baby is not breastfeeding well. Express as often as your baby would normally nurse to maintain your milk production. This will also provide milk for your baby until they return to breastfeeding. For more information seeExpressing your milkEngorged breastsIf your milk is not being removed sufficiently, you may experience engorgement, which makes it harder for your baby to latch on and breastfeed. Gently hand express a little milk before feeding to soften the breast. Reverse pressure softening works by moving fluid away from the nipple area:Press all five fingertips of one hand around the base of the nipple. Apply gentle steady pressure for about a minute to leave a ring of small dimples on the areola.You can also press with the sides of your fingers: place your thumb on one side of the nipple and two fingers on the other side where your baby’s lips will be.Seek supportSupport is invaluable when you are experiencing difficulties with breastfeeding. An LLL Leader will have experience with helping mothers and be a sympathetic listener when you need to share your feelings and find a solution. You can also attend your local LLL group meetings.A stressful timeIt can be upsetting if the very activity that soothes a baby – nursing – is a source of frustration or distress. You may feel that there’s nothing you can do. However, with the right encouragement, most babies do breastfeed again. In the meantime, offer lots of carrying and close contact.Try other things to calm your baby:Singing or talking calmly.Holding them against your shoulder or in a sling if they don’t like to be held in a “nursing position”.A peaceful environment.Taking a walk or a bath together.Be kind to yourselfDeal with the challenge one feed at a time.Reduce commitments and chores to give yourself time to concentrate on your baby. If you have a support person, ask them for extra help.Express your milk. This releases oxytocin, which can be calming.Use relaxation techniques such as massages, music, warm baths, low lighting and deep breathing.Further ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.

Hand Expression of Breastmilk,https://laleche.org.uk/hand-expression-of-breastmilk/,"If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, milk expression by hand is a useful technique to learn. It’s a handy way to relieve engorged breasts. You can also use it to stimulate milk production and provide milk for a baby who is not breastfeeding well or needs more milk.Why hand expression?If you use a pumpPractice helpsHow breasts workBefore you startRelax and get comfortableHow to hand expressStep by stepHow long will hand expressing take?Hand expressing shouldn’t hurtWhy hand expression?Skin-to-skin contact with hand expression encourages the milk ejection reflex (MER) or ‘let-down reflex’.Mothers usually get more milk using hand expression alone or combined with pumping than using just a pump.It requires no special equipment and is always available, even in emergencies.It’s convenient and free.Hand expression is particularly useful if you need to express colostrum during late pregnancy (seeAntenatal Expression of Colostrum) or in the first few days after birth. It makes it easy to save every drop of precious colostrum.If you use a pumpWhatever pump you may use, combiningpumpingwith hand expression can help you express more milk more effectively.Breast massage and hand expression can be used at the beginning to get your milk flowing.Breast massage while pumping increases the amount of milk you can express.Continuing to hand express can release milk remaining, evenafter the pump flow has stopped.And if your pump breaks down, or there is no electricity, youalways have your hands.Practice helpsHand expression is simple to learn and gets easier with practice. You may receive information and a demonstration of hand expression from your midwife. Developing your own routine, starting with relaxation techniques and stimulating milk flow, makes it easier too.How breasts workWhen milk is removed more often, your breasts feel soft and comfortable and produce milk faster. When milk is removed infrequently, your breasts may feel full but produce milk more slowly. Frequent milk removal is the key to maintaining milk production whether you are breastfeeding or expressing. Expressing stimulates your breasts—though not as effectively as a baby—to make and release milk.For more information onhow milk production works, click here.Before you startWash your hands. Have a suitable clean container available to collect your milk: colostrum can be expressed into a small (5ml) container or even onto a teaspoon for immediate feeding. Once milk production has increased milk may spray in several directions so a bowl, wide mouthed container or a bottle with a funnel might be more practical.Relax and get comfortableMilk tends to flow better when you are feeling comfortable, relaxed and warm. Tension or anxiety inhibits milk flow. Relaxation techniques can help increase the amount of milk you can express. The sound of running water may help, or you could practise in the bath or shower.Seek privacy; try the breathing exercises you learnt for use during labour; visualise flowing milk. Have your baby nearby, or think of him. Use photos or recordings of your baby and smell his clothing. All these will help stimulate milk flow. Take a few deep breaths, drop your shoulders and release tension with each exhalation. Bending forward with your breasts suspended means gravity can help milk flow.How to hand expressOne basic approachStart by encouraging milk flow in both breasts.Then hand express from each breast until milk flow slows right down. If you need to increase milk production, continue expressing for a couple of minutes after milk flow has stopped.Repeat these two steps at least twice more. You will find milk flow slows or stops sooner each time you repeat.Most mothers adapt the above approach to suit themselves, so experiment to find what works best for you.Step by stepEncouraging milk flowStimulating your milk ejection reflex (MER or ‘let-down’) is the key to expressing. It can take a few minutes. You may see drops of colostrum or breastmilk, or even experience a tingling sensation, but many mothers don’t see any milk until they start actually expressing. Experiment with the following suggestions to find out what works best for you.Massage your breast starting at the top, using a firm circular pressure on one spot. After a few seconds, lift up your fingers to move to the next area on the breast. Spiral around the breast towards the areola and nipple.Stroke your breast from the top of the breast to the areola and nipple. Light stroking with fingers is one option, or use a soft item with a light tickle-like stroke. Continue this stroking motion from the chest wall to the nipple around the whole breast.Shake your breast gently while leaning forward so gravity can help your milk flow.Hand positionYou can use either or both hands on one breast, or express both breasts at the same time. Hold your hand in the shape of a letter ‘C’, with your thumb and forefinger behind the base of your nipple, feeling for the change in texture of your breast. Move you fingers closer to, or away from your nipple to find the best place for you.To expressStart with the pad of your thumb at the top of your breast, and your finger pads below.Support your breast, then press the breast towards the chest wall to put pressure on the milk ducts.Now compress the breast between your fingers and thumb to move the milk forward towards your nipple.Release and repeat rhythmically: press—compress—relax (like a baby breastfeeding) until milk flow stopsThen rotate your hand around the breast a little and repeat. Do this for each section of your breast until it feels soft and comfortable. Keep your fingers and thumb opposite one another as you rotate.Remember that when a baby breastfeeds, milk doesn’t flow immediately, so it’s normal for it to take a little time for milk to start flowing when you express. Switch back and forth between breasts as the flow slows to encourage further MERs.This videohas a good demonstration of hand expression of breastmilkHow long will hand expressing take?Allow plenty of time at first: the whole process may take 20 or 30 minutes, but you can always stop and start again later if you need to. Frequent short sessions are usually more effective than infrequent, longer expressing sessions.Switching between breasts several times as milk flow slows can help trigger further milk ejection reflexes. The more MERs you stimulate, the more milk you will be able to express and make.Hand expression shouldn’t hurtSqueezing, pulling and sliding fingers along the skin can cause discomfort, bruising and skin burns. Pain or discomfort inhibit the MER and are signs that something needs adjusting. If your breast feels engorged or tender try warm moist heat immediately before expressing. Start expressing from the most comfortable areas.Removing milk from areas around a blocked duct can reduce the discomfort, making it easier to express from the tender area later.Written by Sue Upstone, Karen Butler and mothers of LLLGB.Further ReadingThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. LLLI.
